TO

HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS

THE PRINCE REGENT


 SIR

The gracious permission which I have received to dedicate these volumes
to your Royal Highness  affords me an opportunity of interesting your
Royal Highness in favour of the amiable and ingenuous people whose
country they describe  The high respect they entertain for British
valour and justice  and the lively gratitude they retain for the
generous system of British Legislation  will  I am sure  give them a
strong claim upon your Royal Highness s good opinion

To uphold the weak  to put down lawless force  to lighten the chain of
the slave  to sustain the honour of the British arms and British good
faith  to promote the arts  sciences  and literature  to establish
humane institutions  are duties of government which have been most
conspicuously performed during your Royal Highness s regency  For a
period of nearly five years  in which I have had the honour  as a
servant of the East India Company  to preside over a mild and simple
people  it has been my pride and my ambition to make known to them the
justice and benevolence of my Prince  whose intentions towards them I
could only fulfil by acting up to the principles of the Authority which
I represented  and by doing every thing in my power to make them happy



To those who judge that the right to express their sentiments
requires no more than sincerity  or that their praise is of a value
to overbalance the disrespect of offering it  I shall leave the usual
language of dedications  Conscious that the assurances of respect and
of loyal attachment can never be offered to your Royal Highness by the
humblest British subject  without meeting a gracious reception

                      I have the honour to be

                With profound veneration and respect

                                SIR

                        YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS S

               Most faithful and most dutiful servant

                      THOMAS STAMFORD RAFFLES

PREFACE


As it is possible that  in the many severe strictures passed  in the
course of this work  upon the Dutch Administration in Java  some of
the observations may  for want of a careful restriction in the words
employed  appear to extend to the Dutch nation and character generally
I think it proper explicitly to declare  that such observations
are intended exclusively to apply to the Colonial Government and
its Officers  The orders of the Dutch Government in Holland to the
Authorities at Batavia  as far as my information extends  breathe a
spirit of liberality and benevolence  and I have reason to believe
that the tyranny and rapacity of its colonial officers  created no less
indignation in Holland than in other countries of Europe

For such  and all other inaccuracies  as well as for the defects of
style and arrangement which may appear in this work  an apology is
necessary  and in the circumstances under which it has been prepared
it is hoped that an admissible one will be found  While in the active
discharge of the severe and responsible duties of an extensive
government  it was not in my power to devote much time to the subject
the most that I could do  was to encourage the exertions of others
and to collect in a crude state such new or interesting matter as fell
under my personal observation  I quitted Java in the month of March in
last year  in the twelve months that have since elapsed  illness during
the voyage to Europe and subsequently  added to the demands on my time
arising out of my late office  and the duties of private friendship
after an absence of many years  have made great encroachments  but
engaged as I am in public life  and about to proceed to a distant
quarter of the globe  I have been induced  by the interest which the
subject of these volumes has excited  and the precarious state of
my health  rather to rely on the indulgence of the public than on
the attainment of leisure  for which I must wait certainly long and
possibly  in vain

Most sincerely and deeply do I regret  that this task did not fall
into hands more able to do it justice  There was one 1   dear to
me in private friendship and esteem  who  had he lived  was of all
men best calculated to have supplied those deficiencies which will
be apparent in the very imperfect work now presented to the Public
From his profound acquaintance with eastern languages and Indian
history  from the unceasing activity of his great talents  his other
prodigious acquirements  his extensive views  and his confident
hope of illustrating national migrations from the scenes which he
was approaching  much might have been expected  but just as he
reached those shores on which he hoped to slake his ardent thirst for
knowledge  he fell a victim to excessive exertion  deeply deplored by
all  and by none more truly than myself

My acknowledgments are due to the Right Honourable Sir JOSEPH BANKS
Bart   the venerable President of the Royal Society  for his kindness
and encouragement  and particularly so to Mr  CHARLES WILKINS
Librarian to the East India Company  as well as to Mr  WILLIAM
MARSDEN  for many suggestions  of which I regret that I have not been
enabled to avail myself so much as I could wish  in consequence of the
haste with which the work has been got up  I am also indebted to Mr
THOMAS MURDOCH  not only for access to his valuable library  but for
illustrations from Portuguese authors  which the reader will find in
the Introduction and Appendix

For all that relates to the Natural History of Java  I am indebted to
the communications of Dr  THOMAS HORSFIELD  Though sufficient for my
purpose  it forms but a scanty portion of the result of his long and
diligent researches on this subject  Of this  however  I am happy to
say  that the Public will shortly be able to judge for themselves

In sketching the state of the Dutch East India Company  and the
measures adopted by the Dutch government respecting Java  subsequently
to the year 1780  I have availed myself of much very valuable
information communicated to me by Mr  H  W  MUNTINGHE  President of
the Supreme Court of Justice at Batavia  and as  in the course of this
work  I have often been obliged to condemn the principles and conduct
of the Dutch colonists  I am anxious to acknowledge the distinguished
merit of this excellent magistrate  and that of Mr  J  C  CRANSSEN
President of the Bench of Schepenen  both selected by the late EARL OF
MINTO to be members of the British Council in Java

The English came to Java as friends  Holland had ceased to be an
independent nation  and for the time there could be but two parties
the one English  the other French  The emissaries of the late ruler
of France had perverted the minds of the majority  many were doubtful
on which side they should rally  At this critical juncture these two
gentlemen declared for England and the ancient order of things  and
to the influence of their decision and conduct is to be ascribed
not only the cordiality and good understanding which soon prevailed
between the English and Dutch  but in a great measure also that general
tranquillity of the country  without which the re transfer of it to
the rule of its former masters might have been impracticable

Of the wisdom and benevolence which determined the late EARL OF MINTO
to place two members of the Dutch nation at the Board of the British
Council in Java  it is unnecessary to speak  The measure was in the
same spirit which uniformly actuated that enlightened and virtuous
statesman  my revered patron and ever lamented friend  The selection
of the two gentlemen whom I have mentioned  was no less advantageous
To their countrymen it was peculiarly so  and I am happy to have this
opportunity of publicly expressing my acknowledgments to them for the
good counsel  firm support  and unwearied exertions  by which they were
distinguished while members of the Board


ORTHOGRAPHY

The principles of Orthography  recommended by Sir WILLIAM JONES  and
adopted by the Asiatic Society at Calcutta  have been adopted in this
work  with some slight modifications  The consonants preserve the
same sounds generally as the same letters in the English alphabet
the vowels are used as in Italian  To avoid confusion  the emphatic
syllables are alone accented  and the inherent vowel  a  has invariably
been adopted

FOOTNOTES

expedition to Batavia in 1811  and expired in my arms a few days after
the landing of the troops




ADVERTISEMENT BY THE EDITOR


In reprinting the History of Java in its present form  the Editor feels
it necessary to say a few words  Though the first edition of this
work has been honored with extraordinary success  and has long been
exhausted  so that copies have become rare  yet Sir STAMFORD RAFFLES
always considered it as a hasty production  requiring great alteration
and improvement  and if it had pleased God to prolong his course
of usefulness in this world  he would have bestowed upon it those
corrections and additions which he thought it required

The present Editor has only ventured to add a few short notes which
she found prepared by Sir STAMFORD  and to omit  according to his
intention  the larger part of the comparative vocabularies  retaining
only a hundred words in each language

The additional plates were prepared some years ago  for a second
quarto edition  they are now published  with those belonging to the
first edition  in a separate quarto volume  detached entirely from the
present work

For the drawings from which the engravings of the antiquities are
made  Sir STAMFORD was indebted to Lieut  Colonel BAKER  of the East
India Company s service  and the present Editor is happy to have this
opportunity of acknowledging the obligation  as well as her thanks  for
many kind intentions to aid her in reprinting this history

On the subject of the plates which originally accompanied the quarto
edition  Sir STAMFORD stated in the Preface to that edition  p  ix
as follows   The plates which accompany this work  not otherwise
distinguished  are from the graver  and many of the designs from the
pencil of Mr  WILLIAM DANIELL  who has devoted his undivided attention
in forming a proper conception of his subject  and spared neither time
nor exertion in the execution

The Editor has only to add  that the size of the map of Java rendered
it impossible to unite it with the present edition of the History
it is therefore added to the engravings  and it is also prepared for
separate circulation

INTRODUCTION


The first arrival of the Portuguese in the Eastern Islands was in the
year 1510  when Alphonzo de Albuquerque first visited Sumatra  In the
following year  Albuquerque conquered the city of Malacca  and sent to
announce that event to those countries and islands which had traded
thither  inviting them to continue their intercourse  and promising
them protection and encouragement 2   To Java and the Moluccas he sent
Antonio de Abrew  having  however  previously prepared the way by a
Moor or Mahomedan  of the name of  Nakoda Ismael   who was trading in
a merchant vessel  Antonio de Abrew sailed on his mission with three
vessels  and took with him several Javans and Malayus who had been
accustomed to trade with Malacca  The first port on Java at which
he arrived was the city of  Agacai  3   and from thence he sailed
to Amboina  one of the Moluccas  where 4  he set up his padroes  or
pillars of discovery and possession  as he had done at every port at
which he had touched  One of the vessels was lost in a storm  but the
people were saved and carried by Abrew to a port in Banda to which
vessels then resorted for trade  and whither it was that the Javan
vessels used to go for cloves  nutmegs  and mace  which were carried to
that port by the natives of the Moluccas in their own vessels

Nakoda Ismael  returning from the Moluccas with a cargo of nutmegs
his vessel was wrecked on the coast of Java  near  Tuban   The cargo of
the  Nakoda s  vessel having been saved  Joam Lopez Alvrin was sent  A
D  1513  by the governor of Malacca with four vessels to receive it
Alvrin was well received in all the ports of Java where he touched  but
particularly at  Sidayu  belonging to  PÃ¡teh Unrug   a prince who had
been defeated at Malacca by Fernan Peres

The straits of  SÃ­nga pÃºra  5  being infested by the cruisers of the
former king of Malacca  who had been expelled from his dominions by
the Portuguese in 1511  the straits of  SÃ¡ban  were the usual route of
the Portuguese vessels from Malacca to the Spice Islands  and in this
voyage they generally touched at the ports of Java

About the year 1520 or 1521  Antonio de Britto  with six vessels
under his command  bound to the Moluccas  touched first at  TÃºban
and proceeded afterwards to  Agacai   where he remained seventeen
days  during which time he sent a boat to the island of  MadÃºra
for the purpose of exploring it  but the men landing incautiously
were surprised and made prisoners  and were not ransomed without much
difficulty  and the friendly intervention of the governor of  Agacai

Antonio de Britto had scarcely accomplished the ransom of his men  when
he was joined by Don Garcia Henriquez with four vessels bound to Banda
for spices  and at the same time a Javan vessel arrived from Banda
This vessel had been furnished with a pass from the Spaniards  under
Fernan de Megalhaen  who having passed by the straits which bear his
name  had arrived at the Spice Islands  This was the first intelligence
which the Portuguese received of Megalhaen s discovery of the route
round the southern extremity of the American continent  and they were
the more mortified at it  as he had left his own country in disgust
and was then in the service of Spain 6

The first voyage made by the Dutch was in 1595  in which year their
first fleet  under the command of Houtman  who had been previously
employed by the Portuguese in the East India service   sailed direct
to Bantam  At this period the Portuguese were at war with the king
of Bantam  to whom Houtman offered assistance  in return for which he
obtained permission to build a factory at Bantam  which was the first
settlement formed by the Dutch in the East Indies

Following the example of the Dutch  the English East India Company
immediately after their incorporation by Queen Elizabeth in 1601
fitted out a fleet of four ships  the command of which was entrusted to
Captain Lancaster  who sailed from London in 1602  first to  Acheen
 AchÃ©   on Sumatra  where he procured part of his cargo  and entered
into a treaty with the king  of which a copy is yet in existence
From  Acheen  he went to  Bantam   and settled a factory there  which
was the first possession of the English in the East Indies  Captain
Lancaster brought home a letter from the king of Bantam to Queen
Elizabeth in 1602  which is still in the state paper office

In 1610  the first Dutch governor general  Bolt  arrived at Bantam  and
finding the situation of his countrymen in that province not favourable
to the establishment of a permanent settlement  removed to  JÃ¡katra
On the 4th of March  1621  the name of  Batavia  was conferred upon the
new establishment of the Dutch in  JÃ¡katra   which from that period
became the capital of their East Indian empire

In 1683  the English  who had hitherto maintained a successful rivalry
with the Dutch  withdrew their establishment from  Bantam

In the year 1811  Holland having become a province of France  the
French flag was hoisted at Batavia  and on the 11th September  in the
same year  the British government was declared supreme on Java  by a
proclamation of that date signed by the Earl of Minto  Governor General
of Bengal  On the 17th of the same month  a capitulation was entered
into  by which all the dependencies fell into the hands of Great
Britain

On the 13th August  1814  a convention was entered into by viscount
Castlereagh  on the part of his Britannic Majesty  restoring to the
Dutch the whole of their former possessions in the Eastern Islands  and
on the 19th August  1816  the flag of the Netherlands was again hoisted
at Batavia

Without adverting to the political importance to Great Britain of the
conquest of Java  or to the great commercial advantages which both
countries might eventually have derived from its remaining in our
hands  I shall merely notice that the loss of it was no immediate
or positive evil to the Dutch  For many years prior to the British
expedition  Holland had derived little or no advantage from the nominal
sovereignty which she continued to exercise over its internal affairs
All trade and intercourse between Java and Europe was interrupted and
nearly destroyed  it added nothing to the commercial wealth or the
naval means of the mother country  the controul of the latter over the
agents she employed had proportionally diminished  she continued to
send out governors  counsellors  and commissioners  but she gained from
their inquiries little information on the causes of her failure  and
no aid from their exertions in improving her resources  or retarding
the approach of ruin  The colony became a burden on the mother country
instead of assisting her  and the Company which had so long governed it
being ruined  threw the load of its debts and obligations on the rest
of the nation

It might have been some consolation for the loss of immediate profit
or the contraction of immediate debt  to know  that such unfavourable
circumstances were merely temporary  that they arose out of a state
of political relations which affected internal improvement  and that
the resources of the colony were progressively increasing  and would
become available when peace or political changes should allow trade to
flow in its former channels  Whether the Dutch could not indulge such
prospects  or whether the system on which the internal government of
their eastern dominion was conducted was in itself ruinous under any
circumstances  a view of the financial and commercial state of Java
before the conquest  and of the causes which led to the losses and
dissolution of the Dutch East India Company  will assist the reader in
determining

In tracing these causes  it is hardly necessary to go further back
than the period of the Company s history immediately preceding the
war of 1780  The accidental calamities of that war brought it to the
brink of ruin  and its importance in the past transactions of the
country being borne in mind  a general concern existed in Holland
for its preservation  and for the restoration and maintenance of its
credit  With the view of affording it the most effective and beneficial
assistance  inquiries were set on foot  not only to discover some
temporary means of relief  but to provide a more permanent remedy for
threatened decline  It is impossible to ascertain what might have been
the result of the measures which were then in contemplation  as the
convulsed state of Europe  and especially of Holland  subsequently to
this period  left no room for their operation  and did not even admit
of making the experiment of their efficiency  The free intercourse
of the mother country with her colonies was interrupted  the trade
was thrown into the hands of neutrals  several possessions were lost
for the want of due protection  and those which remained were left to
support or defend themselves in the best way they could  without any
assistance or reinforcement from home

For ten years preceding the year 1780  the average annual sales of
the Company amounted to upwards of twenty millions of guilders
which was considerably more than in former years  and the prices of
the different articles were nearly the same as they had been from the
years 1648 to 1657  when the sales only amounted on an average to about
eight millions a year  it was therefore clear  that the decline of the
Company was not to be attributed to the decrease of trade

On an examination of the Indian books  it was found  that from the year
1613 to 1696  the profits in India  though moderate  had always kept
equal pace with the profits in Europe


          From                 To           To          To
          1613               1653          1663        1673

                            Guilders     Guilders     Guilders
  The total profits were   101 704 417  142 663 776  206 072 335
  Expences                  76 177 755  117 616 961  161 271 745

  Nett Profits              25 526 662   25 046 315   44 330 590



          From                To           To
          1613               1683         1693

                            Guilders     Guilders
  The total profits were   259 250 969  322 735 312
  Expences                 212 282 020  274 416 306

  Nett Profits              46 968 949   48 319 506


 Thus  on an average of forty years till 1653  the annual profits
 were about                      640 000  guilders a year

 Of fifty years  to 1663  about  500 000   do
 Of sixty do     to 1673         750 000   do
 Of seventy do   to 1683         670 000   do
 Of eighty do    to 1693         600 000   do

In the year 1696  the nett profit from the same year  1613  amounted
to only 40 206 789 guilders  being full eight millions less than it
had been in 1693  only three years preceding  and the average nett
annual profit from 1613 was reduced to 484 371 guilders  But from
1697 to 1779  comprehending a like period of eighty three years  the
losses were so exorbitant as to overbalance and absorb  not only the
contemporary  but all the preceding profits in Europe  and even a large
amount of fictitious profit stimulated to screen the government in
India

The nett amount of profits calculated from 1613  amounted

                    Guilders
 In 1697  to only  38 696 527
 In 1703           31 674 645
 In 1713           16 805 598
 In 1723            4 838 925
 In 1724            1 037 777

In 1730 there was already a total loss of 7 737 610  and in the year
1779 this loss amounted to 84 985 425

The Company used to send yearly to India  before the commencement of
the war of 1780  twenty ships of about nine hundred tons each  and
eight or ten of about eight hundred tons each  which  to the number of
twenty two or twenty three  returned with cargoes  four from China
three from Ceylon  three from Bengal  one from Coromandel  and twelve
or thirteen from Batavia  They annually exported to India provisions
and other articles of trade to the amount of two millions six or
eight thousand florins  and in cash from four to six millions  and
sold yearly to an amount generally of twenty or twenty one millions
and it was estimated that the Indian trade maintained  directly and
indirectly  all the external commerce of Holland  employing a capital
of about two hundred and sixty millions of florins

From the inquiries of a commission appointed by the government of
Holland  in the year 1780  to ascertain the real state of the Company s
finances  and to report how far the nation would be warranted in giving
its further support to the credit of an institution which had so
rapidly declined  it appeared that in 1789  the arrears of the Company
amounted to seventy four millions of florins  and that this amount had
since increased to eighty four or eighty five millions  of which sum no
less than 67 707 583 florins had been advanced by the nation

The Commissioners  however  being of opinion  that the affairs of the
Company were not irretrievable  recommended a further loan of seven
millions of florins

A meritorious servant of the Company  Mr  C  Tetsingh  had offered
to the Commissioners a memorial  in which he proposed that the
Company should abandon the trade to private merchants under certain
restrictions  but on this proposal the Commissioners stated that they
were not then prepared to offer an opinion

This Commission  in reporting upon the manner in which the Company s
affairs had been managed in India  declared that  they could not
conceal the deep impression which the same had made upon their minds
and that they could not fix their thoughts upon it  without being
affected with sentiments of horror and detestation       When   said
they   we take a view of our chief possession and establishment  and
when we attend to the real situation of the internal trade of India
the still increasing and exorbitant rate of the expenses  the incessant
want of cash  the mass of paper money in circulation  the unrestrained
peculations and faithlessness of many of the Company s servants  the
consequent clandestine trade of foreign nations  the perfidy of the
native princes  the weakness and connivance of the Indian government
the excessive expenses in the military department and for the public
defence  in a word  when we take a view of all this collectively  we
should almost despair of being able to fulfil our task  if some persons
of great talents and ability among the directors had not stepped
forward to devise means by which  if not to eradicate  at least to stop
the further progress of corruption  and to prevent the total ruin of
the Company

The improvements proposed by the directors extended to every branch of
the administration abroad  They proposed  first  with regard to the
Cape of Good Hope  the yearly arrears of which settlement had latterly
amounted to a million and a half of florins  that the same should be
reduced to one half of that sum  With regard to the further eastern
possessions  the measures proposed for consideration were chiefly the
following

To confine the Company s future trade to opium  spices  pepper  Japan
copper  tin  and sugar  as far as the European and Japan markets
would require  To abandon the trade to Western India to the Company s
servants and free merchants  under payment of a certain recognition
To abandon several factories in that quarter  and to reduce the
rest to mere residencies  To make considerable reductions in the
establishment on the coast of Malabar and in Bengal  To reduce the
establishments on the coast of Coromandel to three factories  To
abandon the establishments on the West coast of Sumatra  and to leave
it open to a free trade  To diminish the expenses at Ceylon by a
reduction of the military force  and by every other possible means to
animate the cultivation and importation of rice into that settlement
To open a free trade and navigation to Bengal and Coromandel  under
the superintendence of the Company  on paying a certain recognition
To encourage  by every means  the cultivation of rice in the
easternmost possessions  and especially at Amboina and Banda  for the
sake of preventing the inducements of a clandestine trade  which the
importation of rice to those places might afford  To abandon several
small factories to the eastward  To adopt a plan for the trade of
Malacca proposed by Governor De Bruem  To introduce a general reduction
of establishment at Batavia and elsewhere  To introduce new regulations
with regard to the sale of opium at Batavia  To improve the Company s
revenue  by a tax upon salaries and a duty upon collateral successions
And finally  to send out commissioners to India  with full powers to
introduce a general reform in the administration

In a memorial subsequently submitted by the Commissioners  which formed
the basis of all the measures recommended and adopted at this time  for
the better administration of affairs in India  after shewing that  from
the year 1770 to 1780  the Company had on the whole of its trade and
establishments on the coast of Coromandel  Bengal  Malabar  Surat  and
the western coast of Sumatra  averaged a profit of only 119 554 florins
a year  they recommended the introduction at Batavia of a public sale
of the spices  Japan copper  and sugar  wanted for the consumption of
Western India  and the establishment of a recognition of ten per cent
on the piece goods from Bengal  and of fifteen per cent  on the piece
goods from Coromandel  Under such a plan of free trade  they calculated
that  after the diminution of the Company s establishments in Western
India  and the abolition of several small forts and factories to the
eastward  it was highly probable that the administration in India
would  in future  cover its own expenses  and thereby save the Company
from utter ruin

It was on these calculations that the Commissioners appointed by the
States of Holland founded their hopes of the future relief of the
Company  and with these prospects they closed their report  the care
and future fate of the Company devolving from that time chiefly on the
Commissioners appointed at their recommendation to proceed to India  in
order to carry into effect  on the spot  the reforms proposed  Of these
new Commissioners  Mr  Nederburg  then first advocate to the Company
was appointed the chief

The Indian Commissioners sailed from Europe in the year 1791  At the
Cape of Good Hope they made such changes and reforms as may be said to
have fully effected the object of their commission  The importance
however  of the Cape being comparatively small  it is not necessary to
enter into any detail of the measures adopted there  The more momentous
part of their trust was undoubtedly to be discharged in India  where
they arrived in 1793

If the talents of these Commissioners were to be estimated by the
benefits which resulted from their labours  we may safely pronounce
them to have been incompetent to the task they had undertaken  but
such a criterion cannot with any justice be applied  A continuance
of peace with Great Britain was of course reckoned upon in all their
calculations  and war with that power broke out almost immediately
afterwards

With regard to the abandonment of several forts and factories to the
eastward  to which their attention had been particularly directed  the
result of their deliberation and inquiry was  that the continuance
of the Company s establishment on Celebes was indispensable for the
protection of the Moluccas  that at Timor reductions had been made
in consequence of which the revenues covered the expenses  that after
mature investigation the Japan trade was shewn to yield a nett profit
of 200 000 florins  that with regard to the West Coast of Sumatra the
revenues had been made to exceed the expenses  and the pepper collected
in that neighbourhood left still some profit to the Company

With respect to the institution of public sales at Batavia for Japan
copper  spices  and sugar  on the introduction of which it was supposed
the establishments in Western India might be for the most part reduced
they were of opinion  after deliberating with the Council of India  and
after a personal inquiry into the actual state of the private trade
at Batavia  that chiefly for the want of an adequate means among the
purchasers such sales were entirely impracticable  and that it would
therefore be preferable  after making some partial reductions in the
expense  to continue the establishment in Bengal and the coast of
Coromandel  but that Cochin on the Malabar coast might  perhaps  be
advantageously abandoned 7

To determine the mode in which the trade with India should in future
be conducted  these Commissioners assumed a general calculation of the
receipts and disbursements which would occur at home and abroad  on the
supposition that the Company should  in future  navigate with hired
vessels only  and that all marine establishments should be abolished
The result of this calculation was in abstract as follows  The estimate
may be considered as affording an interesting view of the hopes and
prospects which were at that time entertained of the resources of the
Eastern Islands

The whole estimate was framed on the principles of monopoly  and with
a view to an increase of the trade on the one hand  and a reduction
of expenses on the other  The quantity of coffee stated at eighteen
million pounds  was calculated upon the produce which might be expected
after two years  In the calculation of the quantity of pepper  an
augmentation of 1 500 000 pounds beyond the produce of the preceding
year was anticipated  from the encouragement given to the growth of
that article in Bantam and other parts of Java  With regard to the
sugar  calculated at 8 000 000 of pounds for the home cargoes  it is
stated  that the actual deliveries

 From Batavia at that time amounted to    6 000 000  lbs
 From ChÃ©ribon                              500 000
 From other ports in Java                 1 000 000

                                          7 500 000  lbs

 Supposing therefore the home cargoes     8 000 000  lbs
 The demand for Surat                     3 500 000
 For Japan                                  900 000
 For the consumption of the Company s own
 establishments                             200 000

 The quantity required would be          12 600 000  lbs


Or 5 100 000 pounds more than the actual produce  The whole of that
quantity  however  the Commissioners felt confident might be produced
in three years  by encouraging the manufacture in the Eastern Districts
of Java  Among the retrenchments was a tax upon the salaries of all
civil servants  which reduced the average salary of each to the sum of
fifteen Spanish dollars per month

These Commissioners seemed to entertain no very favourable ideas of the
benefits which would arise to private trade from the license it already
enjoyed  As a measure much more beneficial to the general trade of
Europe and to the Company  they proposed  in lieu of it  to throw open
to individuals  under certain restrictions  the trade and navigation
from Europe to Bengal and Coromandel

Thus we see these Commissioners sent out with the view of introducing
something like free trade on Java  coming to a resolution to take away
from it even the little private trade which it had previously been
allowed to enjoy

The Company s trade with continental India had already been so much
encroached upon by foreigners  that it was judged expedient no longer
to exclude the Dutch free trader from his share in the spoil  but it
was hoped  by increased strictness  to preserve entire to the Company
the exclusive trade in spices  Javan coffee  pepper as far as it was
the produce of her own possessions  Japan copper  the opium which was
consumed in Java and in the Moluccas  and Javan sugar

The trade of the Dutch Company has thus been brought to the period
when its monopoly was proposed to be almost exclusively confined
to Java and the Eastern Islands  including Japan  The causes which
operated to destroy the Dutch influence on the continent of India  are
too well known to require any particular description

The Dutch had long maintained a decisive superiority  as well on the
continent of Asia  as among the Indian islands  until the active
exertions of their competitors in trade succeeded in undermining
and overturning their monopoly  and as it was natural their weak
side should suffer first  it was on the continent  where their
establishments were far removed from the chief seat of government  and
where they had not been able to insure to themselves those exclusive
privileges from the princes of the country which they had exacted from
the weaker princes of the Eastern Islands  that other nations  chiefly
the French and English  first endeavoured to introduce themselves

After reciprocal jealousies had for some time prevented both nations
from making any considerable progress  a successful war at last turned
the scale entirely in favour of the English  whose influence  from that
period  has been paramount in continental India  and the Dutch East
India Company was no longer able to enforce its system of exclusive
trade there

Without inquiring into the practicability of realizing the flattering
estimate made out by the Indian Commissioners  or the policy which
dictated a still more rigorous monopoly of the produce of the Eastern
Islands  it ought to be remarked  although it seems never to have
been adverted to by the Commissioners  whose calculations and plans
were exclusively of a commercial nature  that the original situation
of the Company as a mere mercantile body  looking out for trade and
not dominion  had undergone a material alteration  by the acquisition
it had made from the middle of the last century of considerable
territorial possessions  especially on the island of Java

To use the words of one of the most enlightened men who now adorns his
country  and is prepared to give energy to a better state of things 8
these territorial acquisitions became to the Company a source of
new relations  In consequence of them  new rights were acquired and
obligations of a novel kind were contracted  as well with regard to
the territories themselves as the population upon them  The nature
of these rights and duties might have been deemed worth inquiry
and as all these territorial acquisitions were made by a delegated
authority derived from the government at home  it was further worthy
of investigation how far the government itself was entitled to a
direct share in the acquisitions made  and how far it was bound to
controul and superintend the exercise of those duties which were newly
contracted  A consideration of these points would have led to the
important question  how far  on a renewal of the Company s charter
it would be requisite to alter and modify its conditions according
to existing circumstances  and especially how far it would have been
expedient  in future  to leave the Company the exclusive trade  and at
the same time the uncontrolled sovereignty over the same country

But however natural it may be  at the present moment  to consider
questions of this kind  it was perhaps at that time beyond the common
course of human thought to entertain doubts on the subject  From an
honourable regard for ancient institutions  the mercantile system of
the Company was still considered with reverence and respect  it had
been at all times the boast and pride of the nation  the services
which the Company had rendered to the state in its earlier days  and
the immense benefits which the government had been enabled  by its
means  to spread among the community at large  had rendered the East
India Company and all its privileges  objects of peculiar care and
tenderness  The rights of sovereignty which the Company afterwards
acquired  were obtained by degrees and almost imperceptibly  Every
acquisition of the kind had been considered  at the time  merely as the
means of increasing its mercantile profits  and all its territorial
rights were looked upon as subservient to its mercantile system

In consequence of these ideas  after the whole of the northern and
eastern coast of Java had been added to the Company s territorial
dominions  by a cession in the year 1749  no step seems to have been
taken for improving these acquisitions  by any direct use of the
supremacy obtained  Some contracts were instituted with the native
chiefs  for delivering gratis  or at the lowest possible price  such
articles as would serve the Company s investments at home  but
taxation  the levy of produce  and the management of police and justice
in the inferior courts  were left to the care and conscience of the
natives themselves

Arguments in favour of this system may perhaps be drawn from the
respect due to the native usages and institutions  and from a supposed
want of power  on the part of the Company  to assume any direct
controul over the native population  But whatever influence these ideas
may have had on the conduct of the Company  it may be affirmed that an
European government  aiming only to see right and justice administered
to every class of the population  might and ought to have maintained
all the native usages and institutions  not inconsistent with those
principles  and that the power  for want of which it withheld its
interference  would have been supplied and confirmed by the act of
exercising the power which it possessed  and by the resources it might
have been the means of drawing from the country

Considering  therefore  the propensity inherent in every native
authority to abuse its influence  and to render it oppressive to the
population at large  the ascendancy of Europeans in general  even
over the class of native chieftains  the scantiness of many of the
establishments proposed in the plan of the Indian Commissioners
the manifest inadequacy of the remuneration of the civil servants
which it recommended  and the narrow scale on which all expenses
were calculated  no very durable benefits could have been reasonably
expected from it  The discretionary power being left in the hands
of the native chieftains  the whole of the lower class of the
population would have remained at their disposal  the ascendancy of
the European servants would have subjected both to peculations  which
the insufficiency of their salaries would constantly have tempted
them to practice  the administration of justice not meeting with a
proper remuneration would have been ineffectual  perhaps corrupt
the reduction of the military establishment would have left the
possessions an easy prey to the first invader  and the original sources
of the Company s revenues in India remaining the same  it seems
probable  that in a short time  the same scenes which had hitherto met
with so much reprobation  would have been acted over again  and to a
still more disgraceful extent

But of whatever merit might have been the plans suggested by the
Commissioners in India on the 4th July  1795  the calamities which had
already befallen the mother country were followed by an event  which
it seems the Commissioners had hardly dared to suspect  and which
in every case  would have frustrated all their designs  This was the
dissolution of the Company  in consequence of a resolution taken to
that effect on the 24th December  by the body then representing the
government of the United States of Holland

New views of policy were of course suggested by this important change
In the year 1800 there appeared a small volume  entitled  A Description
of Java and of its principal Productions  shewing the Advantages to
be derived therefrom under a better Administration  by Mr  Dirk Van
Hogendorp   in which the writer  after observing that the true state of
Java and its importance to the mother country had hitherto been little
known  or at least that no correct ideas had yet been formed in Holland
with regard to its value  fertility  population  and advantageous
situation for trade  establishes

1  That the system on which the trade in India had hitherto been
conducted and the possessions administered  was no longer good under
present circumstances  but contained in itself the seeds of decline and
ruin

2  That the exclusive trade was in its nature injurious  and naturally
caused the ruin of the colonies

3  That under a different system  those colonies would flourish  and
yield much greater advantages than ever

4  That a revenue  founded on the principles of freedom of trade
property in the soil  and equality of imposts  could be easily
introduced

5  And finally  that all the benefits which would thereby accrue
to the mother country  from the territorial revenue  the duties on
trade  the industry and wealth for which that trade would furnish
employment  and the treasures which the distribution of produce
throughout Europe must bring into the mother country  would greatly
exceed the highest advantages that could be calculated upon  even under
the most favourable prospects  by the means of the fallen Company or a
continuation of its former system

Many parts of this pamphlet abound in violence and invective  and
others are too highly coloured  but with these exceptions  it may be
safely asserted that it contains a more correct view of the state of
society  and of the resources of the country  than any paper which
had preceded it  and the author is most justly entitled to all the
credit of having chalked out to his countrymen the road to honour and
prosperity  in the future administration of the Dutch East Indian
colonies

Having  in the course of the foregoing sketch of the decline and
fall of the Dutch East India Company  exhibited a statement of these
resources  under the mercantile system of the Company  it may be
interesting also to state what  in the opinion of Mr  Hogendorp  the
island of Java alone was capable of affording eventually  under a
system founded on the principles of property in the soil  freedom of
cultivation and trade  and the impartial administration of justice
according to equal rights   When the exclusive and oppressive trade
of the Company  the forced deliveries  the feudal services  in short
the whole system of feudal government  is done away with  and when the
effects of this important revolution are felt in the certain increase
of cultivation and trade  then   observes Mr  Hogendorp   the limits of
probability will by no means be exceeded  in estimating the aggregate
of the revenues of Java  in progress of time  at twelve millions of
rix dollars  or twenty four millions of guilders  annually

This statement  calculated with reference to the comparative produce of
the West India Islands  has been generally considered by the colonists
as exhibiting a very exaggerated view  of what the island could  under
any circumstances  afford  and by many as too wild a speculation to
deserve attention  but to this it should be added  that the plan on
which it was founded  viz  an entire change in the internal management
of the country  was considered as equally wild and romantic by those
who declaimed the loudest against the possibility of these advantages
accruing  and that notwithstanding the doubts then entertained of its
practicability  that measure has been actually carried into effect
without producing any one of the consequences depicted by the advocates
of the old system  and as far as a judgment can yet be formed  with all
the advantages anticipated by Mr  Hogendorp

It is not surprising to find  that the enlightened views of this writer
were never acted upon  when we find it asserted by a commission
who sat at the Hague in 1803  composed of the highest  and perhaps
best qualified persons in the state of Holland  and of which he was
himself a member  of course a dissenting one   that  it appeared to
them to have been admitted generally  and without contradiction  that
according to ancient regulations  of which the first institution
was lost even among the Javans themselves  the manner in which that
people are used to live rests on principles  with which a free and
unlimited disposition of the ground and its productions is absolutely
inconsistent  that they were  for their parts  convinced that such a
change could not be effected  without causing a general fermentation
among all classes of people  that though  in this case  violent
measures might suppress an insurrection  they would rather advise to
bid an eternal farewell to Java  than to resort to such means  that
if they adverted to the question in a commercial point of view  the
same uncertainty  the same dangers presented themselves  These arose
from the natural disinclination of the Javan to work  which has been
observed by many eminent persons  the danger of new monopolies  which
would fall heavier upon the common people than the present forced
deliveries  the exorbitant charges to support a great number of native
chiefs and priests  who are at present provided for and ought to be
supported  an undoubted deficiency in the revenues  and a considerable
expenditure during the first years  without the probability of a
remedy  All this   say they   seems to forebode a neglect of the
cultivation  and after long and laborious researches  we are compelled
to lay it down as a general principle  that property  of the soil
among the common Javans  and the abolition of public services  cannot
be adopted as the basis of an improvement  of which the internal
management of Java would be susceptible  The contingents and forced
deliveries ought therefore to be continued and received on account
of the state  which has succeeded to the prerogatives of the former
Company 9

Marshal Daendels  who was recalled from the government of Java only a
few months before the British conquest  and who was by far the most
active and energetic governor who had for a long time been at the head
of the colony  has written an account of his own administration  of
the state in which he found the island  of the measures he proposed
and executed  of the improvements which he projected or carried into
effect  of the revenues that might be expected  and of the expenditure
that the public service required  Although he enters into some free
and bold strictures on the conduct of the Commissioners  the estimates
they formed  and the policy they recommended  he does not seem himself
to have avoided many of the faults which rendered their policy
objectionable  or to have entertained any hope of establishing a more
liberal system  Forced services and contingents  and all the tyranny
which they render necessary  still constituted the greatest part of
the ways and means of the colonial treasury  and the grand source of
profits for the Company

The difficulties he had to struggle with  and the peculiar habits
and character formed by his profession  seem to have determined his
proceedings  more than any matured scheme of general administration
or any deliberate principles of government  He thus describes the
situation of the colony on his arrival   A powerful enemy threatened
us by sea  and the Javan princes  acquiring audacity in proportion as
they saw proofs of our weakness  thought the moment had arrived for
prescribing the law to their former superiors  The very existence of
our dominions on Java was thus in the greatest danger  Our internal
resources of finance were exhausted  while a stagnation of trade
caused by the blockade of our shores  cut off all hopes of procuring
assistance from without  In the midst of such disastrous circumstances
and the failure of so many attempts to introduce reform  and to
maintain the dignity of government   I found it necessary to place
myself above the usual formalities  and to disregard every law  but
that which enjoined the preservation of the colony entrusted to my
management   The verbal order which I received  at my departure from
Holland  had this for its object  and the approbation bestowed upon my
attempts to carry it into execution  encouraged me in the course of
proceeding which I had began

The situation in which the Marshal found the colony is justly drawn
but the result of his operations  and the condition in which he left
the government to his successor  are described in colours by far too
flattering  His partiality for his own work  and the consciousness of
having made great exertions to accomplish it  seems to have influenced
his mind too easily  in convincing him of the advantage and success of
the measures he had adopted   In spite   says he   of all the obstacles
I encountered  I obtained the following results  I made the general
government the centre of authority  from which every inferior authority
descended in a determined proportion  with a definite responsibility
and a salutary controul  Into all the local and subordinate
administrations  clearness and simplicity were introduced  agriculture
was encouraged  protected  and extended  general industry was promoted
the administration of justice and of the police was put on a sure
footing  the means of defence were increased as much as possible
many works were undertaken  both for the service of government and
other useful ends  new roads were made and old ones improved  the
condition of all the inhabitants  as well native as European  was
ameliorated  and every cause of misunderstanding removed  the relations
of the colonial government with the courts of the native princes were
regulated on principles  conformable to the dignity  and conducive to
the interests of the former  and  in fine  the revenues of the colony
were so augmented  that after every deduction for internal expenditure
they will furnish a surplus of five millions  free of all charge  as a
nett return to Holland

Marshal Daendels  in his memoir  sufficiently showed the fallacy
contained in the report of the Commissioners  concerning the estimated
revenue and profits of the Company  Instead of the receipt of
1 250 000 florins  accruing from the profit of the sale of opium  as
marked in the table which I have transcribed   he assures us that not
one farthing was actually obtained  Many of the conclusions of the
Commissioners  concerning the temper of the inhabitants  the nature
of the soil of particular districts  and the general resources of the
island  he satisfactorily proved to be founded on erroneous information
or mistake  and it is only to be regretted  that he did not carry the
same spirit of impartiality into the formation of his own reports
which he requires in those of his predecessors  or anticipates from his
successors  an examination equally rigorous  and a measure of justice
equally strict as that to which they were subjected  Had this been
the case  we should not have been offered such financial results as
make the revenue of the island amount to 10 789 000 rix dollars  and
its expenditure only 5 790 000  leaving a balance of five millions of
profit  It may be interesting to compare his estimate with the table
already exhibited

6  The following is the description of Java from Jono de Barros
Decada 4  book 1  chap  12

Before we treat of the expedition of Francisco de Sa  it is proper
to state the occasion of the expedition  and how that was connected
with the treaty of peace and friendship which  by order of Jorge de
Albuquerque  governor of Malacca  Henriquez Lerne concluded with the
King of Sunda  on account of the pepper produce in that kingdom

We must  therefore  first give an account of the voyage of Henriquez
Lerne  The kingdom of Sunda being one of those of the island of Java
it will be best to begin with a general description of that island
that what follows may be understood

The land of Java we consider as two islands  whose position is from
east to west  and nearly in the same parallel  in seven or eight
degrees of south latitude  The total length of the two islands
according to the best authorities  is about one hundred and eighty
leagues  although perhaps this is rather exaggerated

The Javans themselves do not divide the land into two islands  but
consider the whole length as constituting only one  and on the west
where it approaches Sumatra  there is a channel of ten or twelve
leagues wide  through which all the navigation of eastern and western
India used to pass  previous to the founding of Malacca

A chain of very high mountains runs along the whole length of Java
Their distance from the northern coast is about twenty five leagues
How far they are from the southern shore is not certainly known  though
the natives say about as far as from the northern

Sunda  of which we are now to treat  is situated at about one third
of the total length of Java from the west end  The natives of Sunda
consider themselves as separated from Java by a river  called  Chiamo
or  Chenan   little known to our navigators  so that the natives  in
dissecting Java  speak of it as separated by this river  Chiamo  from
the island of Sunda on the west  and on the east by a strait from the
island of BÃ¡li  as having Madura on the north  and on the south an
undiscovered sea  and they think that whoever shall proceed beyond
those straits  will be hurried away by strong currents  so as never to
be able to return  and for this reason they never attempt to navigate
it  in the same manner as the Moors on the eastern coast of Africa do
not venture to pass the Cape of Currents

The following is the substance of a note inserted in Jono de Barros
Decadas  p  76 77  vol  4  part 1st  8vo  Lisbon 1777

The island of Java is divided into many kingdoms along the northern
coast  and beginning to the eastward  those of which we have any
account are   Paneruca    Ovalle    Agasai    Paniao   whose king
resides in the interior  and has a supremacy over those just
mentioned    Beredam    Sodaio    Tubam    Cajoam    Japara   the
capital of this kingdom is called  Cheronhama   three leagues from the
sea coast  near to which  Japara  is situated    Damo    Margam   and
Matarem

In the mountainous interior live a numerous class of chiefs  called
Gunos  they are a savage race  and eat human flesh  The first
inhabitants were Siamese  who about the year 800 of the Christian era
on their passage from Siam to Macassar were driven by a great storm
on the island of  BÃ¡li   Their junk being wrecked they escaped in
their boat  and arrived at Java  until that period undiscovered  but
which  on account of its size and fertility was immediately peopled by
Passara   son of the king of Siam  and the city of  Passaraan   called
after his own name  was founded at a very good seaport  and this was
the first settlement on the island

The Javans are proud  brave  and treacherous  and so vindictive  that
for any slight offence  and they consider as the most unpardonable the
touching their forehead with your hand  they declare  amok  to revenge
it  They navigate much to every part of the Eastern Archipelago  and
say that formerly they used to navigate the ocean as far as the island
of Madagascar  St  Laurence

The city of  Bintam   or  Banta   which is in the middle of the
opening of the straits of Sunda  stands in the centre of a large
bay  which from point to point may be about three leagues wide  the
bottom good  and the depth of water from two to six fathoms  A river
of sufficient depth for junks and galleys  falls into this bay  and
divides the town into two parts  On one side of the town there is a
fort  built of sun dried bricks  the walls are about seven palms thick
the bulwarks of wood  well furnished with artillery

The island of Sunda is more mountainous than Java  It has six good
sea ports   Chiamo   at the extremity of the island   Chacatara   or
Caravam    Tangaram    Cheginde    Pandang   and  Bintam   which have
a great traffic  on account of the trade carried on  not only with
Java  but with Malacca and Sumatra

The principal city of this kingdom is called  Daro   situated a little
towards the interior  and we are assured that when Henriquez Lerne
first visited it  this town had upwards of fifty thousand inhabitants
and that the kingdom had upwards of one hundred thousand fighting men

The soil is very rich  An inferior gold  of six carats  is found
There is abundance of butcher s meat  game and provisions  and
tamarinds which serve the natives for vinegar  The inhabitants are
not very warlike  much addicted to their idolatries  and hate the
Mahomedans  and particularly since they were conquered by the  Sangue
PÃ¡ti Dama

Here four or five thousand slaves may be purchased  on account of the
numerous population  and its being lawful for the father to sell the
children  The women are handsome  and those of the nobles chaste  which
is not the case with those of the lower classes  There are monasteries
or convents for the women  into which the nobles put their daughters
when they cannot match them in marriage according to their wishes  The
married women  when their husbands die  must  as a point of honour  die
with them  and if they should be afraid of death they are put into the
convents

The kingdom descends from father to son  and not from uncle to nephew
son of the sister   as among the Malabars and other infidels in India

They are fond of rich arms  ornamented with gold and inlaid work
Their  krises  are gilt  and also the point of their lances  Many other
particulars might be added  but we reserve them for our geography 11
concerning the productions of this island  in which upwards of thirty
thousand quintals of pepper are collected annually

                        Decad  iv  Chapter 13

In the year 1522  Jorge Albuquerque  governor of Malacca  equipped a
vessel to carry Henriquez Lerne  with a competent suite and certain
presents  to the king Samiam above mentioned  for the purpose of
establishing a commercial intercourse  Lerne was well received by the
king  who was fully sensible of the importance of such a connection
in the war in which he was then engaged with the Moors  Mahomedans
and  therefore  he requested that  for the protection of the trade
the king of Portugal should erect a fortress  and that he would load
as many ships as he chose with pepper  in return for such merchandise
as the country required  And further  he  the king  obliged himself
as a pledge of his friendship  to give him annually a thousand bags
of pepper  from the day on which the building of the fortress should
commence



These things being concluded and presents exchanged  Lerne returned
to Malacca  where he was well received by Albuquerque  who immediately
communicated the result to the king of Portugal  who approved of all
that had been done



Francisco de SÃ¡ was in consequence dispatched with six vessels  the
names of which and of their commanders are enumerated   with which he
called at Malacca  and accompanied the expedition against Bintam  then
in the possession of the expelled king of Malacca   on leaving which he
was overtaken by a dreadful storm  and one of his vessels  commanded by
Dironte Coelho  reached the port of Calapa  where the fort was to be
built   where she was driven on shore  and all the crew perished by the
hands of the Moors  Mahomedans   who were then masters of the country
having a few days before taken the town from the native king  who had
concluded the treaty with the King of Portugal  and given him the site
on which to erect the fortress



But although the intended establishment on Java was thus frustrated
the Portuguese continued to have intercourse with that island  at which
they frequently touched on their voyage to and from the Moluccas

                    Decad  iv  Book i  Chapter 14

In August  1626  Antonio de Britto  on his return from Ternati
to Malacca  touched at the port of Paneruca  where he found his
countryman  Jono de Moreno  who had twenty Malay junks under his
command  From thence he proceeded to the town of  Tagasam   whose
inhabitants were at war with the Portuguese  and had captured a junk
laden with cloves  which he had dispatched to Malacca  and they even
attempted to take the vessel in which he himself was  which occasioned
his quitting that place  having however first captured a junk laden
with provisions

                    Decad  iv  Book i  Chapter 17

In July  1528  Don Garcia Henriquez appears to have touched at the
port of Paneruca   Panarukan  for the purpose of taking in provisions
on his way to Malacca  and it also appears  that the king or chief of
Paneruca sent ambassadors to the Portuguese governor of Malacca in the
same year 1528

The following is the substance of a description of Java from the Decada
of Diego de Couto   Decad  iv  Book iii  Chapter i

Couto describes the wreck of a Portuguese vessel  and the destruction
of her crew by the Moors  who had just become masters of the kingdom of
Sunda  in nearly the same words as Barros  He then proceeds to state
that Francis de SÃ¡ ran before the storm along the coast of Java  and
collected his scattered vessels in the port of  Paneruca   and gives a
general description of Java in nearly the following words

But it will be proper to give a concise description of this country
and to shew which were the Greater and the Lesser Java of Marco Polo
and clear up the confusion which has prevailed among modern geographers
on this subject

The figure of the island of Java resembles a hog couched on its fore
legs  with its snout to the channel of  Balaberao   and its hind legs
towards the mouth of the Straits of Sunda  which is much frequented by
our ships  This island lies directly east and west  its length about
one hundred and sixty  and its breadth about seventy leagues

The southern coast  hog s back  is not frequented by us  and its
bays and ports are not known  but the northern coast  hog s belly  is
much frequented  and has many good ports  and although there are many
shoals  yet the channels and the anchorages are so well known  that but
few disasters happen

There are many kingdoms along the maritime parts  some of them
subordinate to the others  and beginning at the east  head of the hog
we will set down the names of such as are known   Ovalle    Paneruca
Agasai    Sodayo    Paniao   whose sovereign resides thirty leagues
inland  and is a kind of emperor over these and others hereafter
mentioned    Tabao    Berdoao    Cajoao    Japara   whose principal
city or town is called Cerinhama  three leagues inland  while Japara
is situated on the sea shore    Damo    Margao    Banta    Sunda
Andreguir   where there is much pepper  which is exported by a river
called Jande   In the mountainous interior there are many kings  called
Gunos   they live among rugged mountains  are savage and brutal  and
many of them eat human flesh

These mountains are exceedingly high  and some of them emit flames
like the island of Ternati  Every one of these kingdoms which we have
named has a language of its own  yet they mutually understand each
other  as we do the Spaniards and Galicians

The kingdom of Sunda is thriving and abundant  it lies between Java
and Sumatra  having between it and the latter the Straits of  Sunda
Many islands lie along the coast of this kingdom within the Straits
for nearly the space of forty leagues  which in the widest are about
twenty five  and in others only twelve leagues broad   Banta  is about
the middle distance  All the islands are well timbered  but have little
water  A small one  called  Macar   at the entrance of the Straits  is
said to have much gold

The principal ports of the kingdom of  Sunda  are  Banta    AchÃ©
Chacatara   or  by another name   Caravao    to which every year
resort about twenty  Sommas   which are a kind of vessel belonging to
Chienhec   Cochin China   out of the maritime provinces of China  to
load pepper  For this kingdom produces eight thousand  bahars   which
are equal to thirty thousand quintals of pepper annually

Bantam is situated in six degrees of south latitude  in the middle of
a fine bay  which is three leagues from point to point  The town in
length  stretching landward  is eight hundred and fifty fathoms  and
the seaport extends about four hundred  A river capable of admitting
junks and galleys  flows through the middle of the town  a small branch
of this river admits boats and small craft

There is a brick fort  the walls of which are seven palms thick  with
wooden bulwarks  armed with two tiers of artillery  The anchorage is
good  in some places a muddy  in others a sandy bottom  the depth from
two to six fathoms

The King  Don John  conceiving that if he had a fortress in this
situation he should be master of the Straits  and of all the pepper of
those kingdoms  recommended it strongly to the lord admiral to have
a fort built by Francisco de Sa  and even now it would be perhaps
still more important as well for the purpose of defending the entrance
against the English and the Turks  as for the general security of the
trade and commerce of those parts  which is the principal value of
India  And it was the opinion of our forefathers  that if the king
possessed three fortresses  one in this situation  one on  Acheen
head   and one on the coast of  Pegu   the navigation of the east would
in a manner be locked by these keys  and the king would be lord of all
its riches  and they gave many reasons in support of their opinions
which we forbear to repeat  and return to Java

The island of Java is abundantly furnished with every thing necessary
to human life  so much so  that from it  Malacca    Acheen   and other
neighbouring countries  derive their supplies

The natives  who are called  Jaos   Javans   are so proud that they
think all mankind their inferiors  so that  if a Javan were passing
along the street  and saw a native of any other country standing on any
hillock or place raised higher than the ground on which he was walking
if such person did not immediately come down until he should have
passed  the Javan would kill him  for he will permit no person to stand
above him  nor would a Javan carry any weight or burthen on his head
even if they should threaten him with death

They are a brave and determined race of men  and for any slight
offence will run  amok  to be revenged  and even if they are run
through and through with a lance  they will advance until they close
with their adversary

The men are expert navigators  in which they claim priority of all
others  although many give the honour to the Chinese  insisting that
they preceded the Javans  But it is certain that the Javans have sailed
to the Cape of Good Hope  and have had intercourse with the island of
Madagascar on the off side  where there are many people of a brown
colour  and a mixed Javan race  who descend from them

Then follows the refutation of a ridiculous story told by Nicolas
Couti  the Venetian  about a tree that produced a rod of gold in its
pith  at which some well informed Javans  of whom Couti inquired
laughed very heartily

Marco Polo mentions the greater and the lesser Java  We are of
opinion  that the Java of which we are treating is the lesser  and
that the island of Sumatra is the greater Java  for he says that the
greater Java is two thousand miles in circumference  and that the
north star is not visible  and that it has eight kingdoms   Taleh
Basma    Camara    Dragojao    Lambri Farafur   from which it is
very clear that he means Sumatra  for it has nearly the dimensions
which he assigns it  The north pole is not visible  as this island
lies under the equinoctial line  which is not the case with any of the
islands situated to the northward  on all of which the north star is
seen  and it is still more evident from the names of the kingdoms  for
there cannot be a doubt that  Camara  is the same as  Camatra   the Ã§
being soft like s    Dragojao   which is pronounced  Dragojang   or
Andreguir   and  Lambri   still retain their names on that island

7  This is the factory which by the recent convention has been
exchanged with England for the Island of Banka

8  Mr  Muntinghe

9  Report of a Committee appointed to investigate East India affairs
made to the Government of the Batavian Republic  dated 31st of August
1803  consisting of Messrs  Murman  Sic  Ponloe  Verbuell  D  Van
Hogendorp  Nederburgh  and Voute

10  In a note on this source of revenue  Marshal Daendels says that he
is sensible of the evils arising from the use of this drug  but that
the Javans are so addicted to it  that no prospect of success could be
entertained from any project for reducing its consumption  Yet even
while he is making this observation  he tells us that the Commissioners
fixed the sale at 1 200 chests  and that he in his estimate has only
taken it at 800  It was afterwards reduced to less than 300 chests
without any fear of disturbance or any danger of illicit trade

11  Barros often alludes to his Treatise on Geography  in which he had
described particularly all the countries mentioned in his Decadas  but
it never was published  having been left in an imperfect state at his
death

  Geographical Situation of Java  Name  Extent
   and Form  Divisions  Harbours  Mountains and
   Volcanos  Rivers and Lakes  General Appearance of

   Climate  Metals  Minerals  Soil  Vegetable and Animal Kingdoms


The country known to Europeans under the name of JAVA  or JAVA MAJOR
and to the natives under those of  TÃ¡na   the land   JÃ¡wa   or  NÃºsa
the island   JÃ¡wa   is one of the largest of what modern geographers
call the Sunda Islands  It is sometimes considered one of the Malayan
Islands  and forms a part of that division of the Oriental Archipelago
which it has been lately proposed to designate as the Asiatic Isles
It extends eastward  with a slight deviation to the south  from 105
11  to 114  33  of longitude east of Greenwich  and lies between the
latitudes 5  52  and 8  46  south  On the south and west it is washed
by the Indian Ocean  on the north west by a channel called the Straits
of  SÃºnda   which separates it from Sumatra  at a distance in one
point of only fourteen miles  and on the south east by the Straits of
BÃ¡li   only two miles wide  which divide it from the island of that
name  These islands  and others stretching eastward  form with Java a
gentle curve of more than two thousand geographical miles  which with
less regularity is continued from Acheen to Pegu on one side  and from
TÃ­mor  to  PapÃºa   or New Guinea  on the other  they constitute on the
west and south  as do  BÃ¡nka    BÃ­liton   the great islands of Borneo
and Celebes  and the Moluccas on the north  the barriers of the Javan
Seas and the Malayan Archipelago  From the eastern peninsula of India
Java is distant about one hundred and forty leagues  from Borneo about
fifty six  and from New Holland two hundred

To what cause the island is indebted for its present name of Java 12
or  JÃ¡wa  as it is pronounced by the natives  is uncertain  Among
the traditions of the country  which are more particularly mentioned
in another place  there is one  which relates  that it was so termed
by the first colonists from the continent of India  in consequence
of the discovery of a certain grain  called  jÃ¡wa wut   13  on which
the inhabitants are supposed to have subsisted at that early period
and that it had been known previously only under the term of  NÃºsa
hÃ¡ra hÃ¡ra  or  NÃºsa kÃªndang   meaning the island of wild uncultivated
waste  or in which the hills run in ridges

In the tenth chapter of Genesis we are told  that  the isles of the
Gentiles were divided in their lands  every one after his tongue  after
their families  in the nations   and in the twenty seventh chapter of
Ezekiel we find among the rich merchants  those of  Javan   who traded
the persons of men  and vessels of brass  to the market of Tyre  and
who going to and fro  occupied in her fairs  brought bright iron
cassia  and calamus   But we shall leave it to others to trace the
connection between the  Javan  of Holy Writ and the Java of modern
times  It appears  that the Arabs  who had widely extended their
commercial intercourse  and established their religious faith over the
greatest portion of the Indian Archipelago  long before the Europeans
had navigated round the Cape of Good Hope  designate the whole of the
nations and tribes which inhabit those regions by the general term of
the people of  Jawi   as in the following passage taken from one of
their religious tracts    The people of  Jawi  do not observe with
strictness the rule laid down for keeping the fast  inasmuch as they
eat before the sun sets  while the Arabs continue the fast until that
luminary has sunk below the horizon    Jawa  or  Jawi  is also the name
by which Borneo  Java  Sumatra  the Malayan Peninsula  and the islands
lying amongst them  are known among the nations of Celebes  who apply
the  BÃºgis  diminutive  Jawa JawÃ¡ka   or Java minor  to the Moluccas
Ãmbon    BÃ¡nda    TÃ­mor   and  Ã‰ndÃ©   Jabadios InsulÃ¦  from  Jaba
and  dib    div  or  dio   has been employed in the largest sense by
Europeans  and it is probable this was once generally the case among
the Asiatics  with the terms  Java    Jawa    Jawi   and  Jaba   14
which  as the appellations of people inhabiting the countries beyond
the continent or distant  some have derived from the word  jaÃ¹   of
very general acceptation in eastern languages  and meaning  beyond
distant   15

It is  perhaps  in consequence of these names having embraced the
whole  or at least several of the islands collectively  that the
accounts given by Marco Polo  and other early European voyagers  of
particular islands  as Java Major and Java Minor  are so inconsistent
with one another  The country described by Marco Polo as Java Minor
seems  beyond doubt  to have been the eastern coast of Sumatra  but
that expression   or Little Java   is now applied exclusively to
BÃ¡li   as  Great Java  is to the island we are now describing  It is
on the latter only  if we except what has been observed of the names
given to the Archipelago generally by the natives of Celebes  that the
islanders themselves apply the name of  Jawa   in any of its forms  to
their own country  It has there even a still more confined application
being generally limited to the eastern districts of the island  which
may be considered as Java proper  in contra distinction to the western
districts  which are for the most part inhabited by a people called
SÃºnda   from whom the Straits and Isles of Sunda have been named by
Europeans

Whether Sumatra  Java  or any other island of the Archipelago  or
the whole or several of them collectively  may not have formed the
Taprobane  of the ancients  is perhaps still an undecided question
notwithstanding the claims to this distinction which have of late years
been rather admitted than proved in favour of Ceylon  The most striking
fact detailed in the accounts which have reached us of this ancient
country  and one which  from its nature  is least likely to have been
disfigured or perverted by the misrepresentations or prejudices of
travellers  is  that it was bisected in nearly equal portions by the
equinoctial line  and that to the southward of it the polar star was
not visible  How can this statement be evaded  or in any way applied to
Ceylon  Major Wilford seems inclined to consider  Taprobane  as derived
from the Sanscrit words  tapa   penance  and  vana   forest or grove
a derivation equally favorable to the claims of the Javans   tapa  and
wana   or  wono   having the like signification in their language  and
if  as there is reason to believe  an extensive intercourse subsisted
in very remote times between Western India and these islands  where was
there a country that could more invite the retreat of holy men  than
the evergreen islands which rise in endless clusters on the smooth seas
of the Malayan Archipelago  where the elevation and tranquillity of
devotion are fostered by all that is majestic and lovely in nature

Although in Sumatra no traces of their residence have yet been
discovered  except in the language and customs of the people  on
Java  which is almost contiguous to it  it is abundantly attested by
monuments still existing in stone and brass  In few countries  with
which we are yet acquainted  are more extensive ruins to be found of
temples dedicated to an ancient worship  If tradition may be trusted
every mountain had its  tapa   or recluse  and the whole energies and
resources of the country would appear to have been applied to the
construction of those noble edifices  the ruins of which still strike
the spectator with astonishment and veneration

That these splendid and magnificent piles were erected under the
superintendance of a foreign people  more skilled in the arts than the
rude and simple natives of the islands  can scarcely be doubted  and
that they were sacred to the rites of the Hindu religion  according to
some persuasion or other  is equally clear  from the numerous images
of deities and attributes by which they are adorned  many of which
are still preserved in their original state  Further investigation
may perhaps establish Java and Sumatra  or rather the Malayan ports
in which general term we may include all the islands containing
the Malayan Ports  as not only the  Taprobane  or  Tapavana  of the
ancients  but also the Sacred Isles of the Hindus

The map of Java which accompanies this work has been drawn principally
from actual surveys  many of which were made by order of the British
Government on the island  The first map of Java which was presented to
the public  and from which nearly all those  which have subsequently
been engraved  are copies  was published by Valentyn  16  and consists
of seven sheets  As  at that period  little more was known of the
island by the Dutch than some parts of the coast  the country in
the immediate vicinity of their capital  with perhaps the province
of Bantam  the author had no materials for making a map of the
whole island  which could pretend to much authority or value  Most
of the land in the immediate vicinity of Batavia having been sold
to Europeans  was of necessity surveyed  in order to ascertain the
different boundaries  but it was only a short time before the arrival
of Marshal Daendels  in 1808  that any steps appear to have been
taken by the local authorities  to procure correct statistical and
topographical information of the other more important districts of the
island  Something to this effect was done during the administration of
Mr  Engelhard  late Governor of the North east Coast  but it was only
during the government of the Marshal that these objects were pursued
with much energy or success

At the period of the arrival of the English  topographical surveys of
SemÃ¡rang  and several of the eastern districts had been completed  and
although somewhat deficient in accuracy of measurement and neatness of
execution  yet as they appeared sufficiently correct for many valuable
purposes  and as the Government was anxious to obtain  without loss of
time  a better acquaintance with the geography of the country  it was
determined to make some sacrifice of accuracy to the considerations
of economy and expedition  and to survey the other districts upon
the same plan  While these surveys were in progress  the territorial
interest which the European government obtained in the central
provinces  induced them to turn their attention to the improvements
of which the Solo River might be susceptible  This river  the most
considerable in the island  passes through  SÃºra kÃ©rta   the capital
of the  SusuhÃºnan   or  as he is termed by Europeans  Emperor of Java
and discharges itself into the sea near  GrÃ©sik   An actual survey
was accordingly made by a British officer of experience  particularly
instructed to ascertain how far it might be practicable to improve its
navigation by the aid of artificial cuts and dams

A greater object soon called for more extensive measures  When it was
determined to introduce an entirely new system of internal management
by the abolition of feudal service  and the establishment of a more
permanent property in the soil  it was deemed essential that a detailed
survey should be made of the different districts successively  in
which the new system was to be introduced  This was intended to form
the basis of a general agricultural survey of the country  then about
to be made  In several of these districts this detailed survey has
been completed  and  with the exception of the provinces still under
native jurisdiction  and called Native Provinces  nearly the whole
of the land on Java  not in a state of absolute forest  has been
measured with more or less accuracy  Of the native provinces but a
very small part has been actually surveyed  with regard to the rest
the materials from which the present map is taken  were principally
obtained from observation made during occasional routes through them
The southern division of Bantam being principally forest  has not been
actually surveyed  neither has the island of Madura been yet surveyed
by Europeans  the eastern part of it was measured by the natives  and
it was principally upon their authority that the map now presented of
that island was drawn  The best charts of both the north and south
coast have been consulted  The three harbours of Wyn Coops Bay
ChelÃ¡chap   and  PachÃ­tan   on the latter  are laid down from actual
survey  as well as the entrance to the harbour of  SurabÃ¡ya   On the
whole  therefore  although the map now engraved is far from perfect
and of course suffers from the reduction necessary to adapt it to the
rest of the work  it is presumed that it will aid the reader in most
of the geographical objects to which this volume will refer  and that
its superiority over those that have previously appeared is such as to
justify its publication

The length of Java  in a straight line drawn between its extreme
points   Java Head  and the south east point of the island  is five
hundred and seventy five geographical  equal to six hundred and
sixty six statute miles  its breadth varies from one hundred and
seventeen geographical  or one hundred and thirty five and a half
statute miles  between the south west point of  PachÃ­tan  bay and the
north point of  JapÃ¡ra   to forty eight geographical or fifty six
statute miles   between the mouth of the  SerÃ¡yu  river and the
MarabÃ¡ya   five degrees east of  TegÃ¡l    17  and it is estimated to
contain an area of about fifty thousand statute miles

Numerous small islands are scattered in its immediate vicinity
particularly along the northern coast  and contribute  with the
projecting points and headlands inclosing the different bays  to form
harbours of various capacities  The most important of these islands
is that of  MadÃºra   which is separated from the main land of Java by
a strait in one part not more than a mile broad  and serves to form
the important harbour of  SurabÃ¡ya   This island has the appearance
of being a continuation of the main land of Java  and having been
long subjected to the same political authority  has generally formed
one of the provinces of the Javan empire  In length  MadÃºra  is about
seventy nine geographical  or ninety one and a half statute miles  and
its narrowest part is about twenty seven geographical  or thirty one
and a quarter statute miles  The small islands lying to the east of it
are considered as its dependencies

The form of Java is chiefly remarkable for the rectangularity of its
outline  which is such that the island might be divided into five
or six parts  each a rectangular parallelogram drawn by an unsteady
hand  Its western and northern coasts abound with bays and inlets  The
outline of  MadÃºra  is more regular  especially on the northern coast

The coast from Bantam to the river  Chi mÃ¡nok   about two degrees in
length on the north  is nearly parallel to that which extends from Wyn
Coops Bay to a point about twenty miles west of  NÃºsa kambÃºng an   the
breadth throughout being about seventy eight geographical miles  and
from the same point to the river  ManchÃ­ngan   a distance of about one
degree and three quarters  the coast is nearly parallel to that which
lies between  ChÃ©ribon  and  SemÃ¡rang   the breadth throughout being
about fifty seven geographical miles  From the west point of  JapÃ¡ra
to point  PÃ¡ngka  on the north  distant from it about two degrees  and
along the corresponding coast on the south  the average breadth is
seventy three geographical miles  and from  SurabÃ¡ya  to the north east
point of the island  distant about one degree and a half  and along
the south coast opposite to it  the average breadth is forty five
geographical miles

At the time when Europeans first visited Java  the whole of the island
acknowledged the supremacy of one sovereign  but there was a period in
its history when it was nearly equally divided under the independent
administration of two powers  one established in the eastern  and the
other in the western districts  and as there is a marked distinction
between the descendants of these two nations  the most general division
of the country is still into the western and eastern districts  to the
latter of which alone the term Java is applied by the natives  They
are separated by the river  LosÃ¡ri   which forms the boundary between
ChÃ©ribon  and  BrÃ©bes   and all the western  the northern  with a
few of the inland districts and the Island of  MadÃºra   are under the
immediate authority and administration of the European government  The
rest of the island remains subject to the native princes  and on that
account is designated on the map and elsewhere  with more regard to
convenience than correctness of language  as the Native Provinces

The provinces under European authority have latterly been divided into
fifteen residencies  or separate administrations  exclusive of the seat
of government  which  as they will be frequently referred to in the
course of this work  it may be convenient to notice in this place

Commencing from the west  the province  or as it is usually termed  the
kingdom of Bantam  properly  BÃ¡ntan   occupies the first place  This
extensive province forms a large portion of the island  It is washed
on three sides by the sea  At the east it joins with the environs and
highlands of Batavia and the district of  Chi Ã¡njur   and on the west
it is bounded by the Straits of Sunda  and in this quarter comprises
dependant islands scattered along its shore  and the two harbours of
Mew  and  MerÃ¡k   which  with other bays  deeply indent the coast
Bantam  the native capital of this province  has been latterly deserted
by the European establishment for  SÃ­rang   commonly called Ceram   an
elevated and healthy station about seven miles further inland

Next in succession towards the east is the division of Batavia  which
comprises what formerly constituted the native province of  JÃ¡katra
or  JokÃ¡rta   The northern part of this division  towards the coast
includes the city of Batavia  populous and important on account of
its excellent roads for shipping  its advantageous position for
European commerce  and as being the long established seat of the
Dutch government  but less fertile and healthy than the more eastern
provinces of the island

South and east of the division of Batavia and its environs lie what
are termed by Europeans the Preanger   PriÃ¡ng en   Regencies  18
the central and southern districts of which  stretching from Bantam
to ChÃ©ribon  are extremely mountainous  This extensive portion of
the island  which now includes a large part of ChÃ©ribon  consists of
the districts of  KrÃ¡wang    ChiÃ¡sem    PamanÃºkan    KÃ¡ndang aÃºr
and  DramÃ¡yu  or  IndramÃ¡yu   along the northern coast  and of the
inland and southern districts of  Chi Ã¡njur    BÃ¡ndung    SÃºmedang
Lim bÃ¡ng an   and  SÃºka pÃºra   the southern coast  from the boundary
of Bantam to that of ChÃ©ribon  being included within the subdivisions
of  Chi Ã¡njur   and  SÃºka pÃºra

To the eastward of these districts  and crossing the island from north
to south  is the province of  ChÃ©ribon   divided into ten principal
districts  To the south is the island of  NÃºsa kambÃ¡ng an  which forms
the harbour of  ChelÃ¡chap

East of ChÃ©ribon  as before noticed  it is only the northern and
some of the inland districts  that are immediately subject to
the European authority  These  during the British government of
the island  were comprised under the administrations of  TegÃºl
PakalÃºng an    SemÃ¡rang    JapÃ¡ra   and  RembÃ¡ng   which under the
Dutch East India Company constituted what was termed the government
of the  North east Coast   the seat of which was at  SemÃ¡rang   and
of  GrÃ©sik    SurabÃ¡ya    PasÃºrÃºan    BisÃºki   and  BanyuwÃ¡ngi
which  with  BankÃ¡lang  and  SÃºmenap  on  MadÃºra   constituted  under
the same authority  the division of the  Oost Hook   or East Point
of the island  of which  SurabÃ¡ya  was the principal station  Inland
of  SemÃ¡rang  and  PakalÃºngan   and bounded by those divisions  and
by the provinces of the native princes  is situated the rich and
fertile district of  KedÃº   which  with the more eastern districts of
Grobogan    WirosÃ¡ri    BlÃ³ra    JÃ­pang    JÃ¡pan   and  WÃ­rasaba
stretching inland from  SemÃ¡rang  to  SurabÃ¡ya   were ceded to the
British government in the year 1812

The capitals of all the northern districts bear the same name with the
districts themselves  and are generally situated on small rivers at no
great distance from the sea

The NATIVE PROVINCES are divided between two native sovereigns  the
SusuhÃºnan   or Emperor of Java  who resides at  SÃºra kÃ©rta   19  on
the  Solo  River  and the Sultan  who resides at  YÃºg ya kÃ©rta   20
near the south coast  in the province of  MatÃ¡rem   These provinces
comprise several of the richest districts of the island  among which
are  BÃ¡nyumas    RÃ³mo    BÃ¡galen   and  MatÃ¡rem   to the west  and
MÃ¡dion    JagarÃ¡ga    SukawÃ¡ti    PranarÃ¡ga    KÃ©rtasÃ¡na    BlÃ­tar
and  KedÃ­ri   to the east  and with the exception of the small
district of  PachÃ­tan   which has been recently ceded to the European
government  occupy the whole of the southern coast from  ChÃ©ribon  to
MÃ¡lang   a distance of not less than two hundred and fifty miles  and
form about a fourth part of the whole island

The districts near the coasts are generally separated from each
other by rivers  those in the interior often by ranges of hills and
mountains  The districts are again divided  each subdivision including
numerous villages

The principal harbour of the island is that of  SurabÃ¡ya  in the
eastern districts  formed by the approaching extremities of Java and
MadÃºra   It is broad and spacious  secure against the violence of the
sea and wind  and may be rendered impregnable to any hostile attack

The next in importance is that of Batavia  more properly  perhaps
called the roads of Batavia  which are sheltered by several islands
lying in the outer part of the bay  These roads  however  not admitting
of any means of permanent defence from the attack of a superior naval
force  the Dutch government  during the late war  were induced to
fortify the small harbour of  MerÃ¡k  Bay  on the north west coast of
Bantam

Along the northern coast  there are perhaps other positions which admit
of being improved into convenient harbours  but where the whole coast
affords excellent anchorage at nearly all seasons of the year  and
where vessels of any burthen can approach all the principal stations
at a convenient distance for the barter of their merchandize  the
purposes of commerce are in that respect already sufficiently provided
for  The sea being usually smooth  and the weather moderate  the native
vessels and small craft always find sufficient shelter at the change of
the monsoon  by running under some of the numerous islands scattered
along this coast  or passing up the rivers  which  though in general
difficult of entrance on account of their bars  are for the most part
navigable to such vessels  as far up as the maritime capitals  through
which they run

The south coast  on account of its exposure to the open ocean  the
consequent high swell or surf which breaks on it  and its general
want of good anchorage  is seldom visited by shipping  But even here
harbours may be found  and those of  ChelÃ¡chap  and  PachÃ­tan  might
no doubt  be frequented with safety  were it considered desirable to
attract commercial adventurers to this side of the island

Passing from the coast to the interior of the country  the stranger
cannot fail to be struck with the bold outline and prominent features
of its scenery  An uninterrupted series or range of large mountains
varying in their elevation above the sea from five to eleven  and
even twelve thousand feet  21  and exhibiting  by their round base or
pointed tops  their volcanic origin  extend through the whole length of
the island

The first of this series  commencing from the westward  is in Bantam
This mountain   GÃ»nung kÃ¡rang    though of moderate elevation compared
with others on the island  22  is seen at a considerable distance from
sea  and is a well known landmark to mariners  It lies due south of the
town of Bantam  at a considerable distance from the sea

The next mountain of the series is the  SalÃ¡k   the eastern foot of
which is connected with the  GedÃ©  or  Panarang o   situated about
fifty miles south of Batavia  These two mountains are seen from the
roads of Batavia  and  from the appearance they exhibit  are usually
termed by mariners the Blue Mountains

From the eastern part of the  GedÃ©   the volcanic series separates into
two independent branches  one of which inclines to the south  the other
proceeds almost due east  slightly verging to the north  The former
breaks into an irregular transverse range  which extends across the
island  till it approaches the northern branch  from whence the general
series is continued in an easterly direction as far as the mountain
SindÃ³ro   the western of the two mountains known by mariners as the
Two Brothers  The mountain  SÃºmbing   or  SindÃ¡ri   the second of The
Brothers   is somewhat further to the south

At a short distance from the eastern foot of the mountain  SÃºmbing  are
three large volcanos  in a direction almost north and south  dividing
the large series transversely  these are the mountains  Ung Ã¡rang
MerbÃ¡bu   and  MerÃ¡pi   The next volcano  in an eastern direction  is
that of  JapÃ¡ra   which deviates more than any other from the regular
series  and forms a peculiar peninsular appendage to the island  The
series is then continued in an easterly course from the  MerÃ¡pi  as far
as the mountain  TelÃ¡gawÃºrung   which is in contact with the ocean at
the eastern end of the island

The several large mountains comprised in this series  and which are
in number thirty eight  though different from each other in external
figure  agree in the general attribute of volcanos  having a broad base
gradually verging towards the summit in the form of a cone

They all rise from a plain but little elevated above the level of
the sea  and each must  with very few exceptions  be considered as a
separate mountain  raised by a cause independent of that which produced
the others  Most of them have been formed at a very remote period  and
are covered by the vegetation of many ages  but the indications and
remains of their former irruptions are numerous and unequivocal  The
craters of several are completely extinct  those of others contain
small apertures  which continually discharge sulphureous vapours or
smoke  Many of them have had irruptions during late years  23

Besides the mountains of the larger series above described  there are
extensive ranges of mountains of an inferior elevation  sometimes
connected with the larger series  and sometimes independent of them
which are also for the most part volcanic  Numerous ridges of hills
traverse the country in various directions  and the surface of the
island in general  independently of these more striking features  is
in most parts undulating and uneven  except on the sea coast

A country which abounds in mountains is seldom deficient in rivers
accordingly  no region is perhaps better watered  Java is singularly
favoured in the number of its streams  The size of the island does
not admit of the formation of large rivers  but there are probably
fifty  that in the wet season  bear down rafts charged with timber and
other rough produce of the country  and not less than five or six at
all times navigable to the distance of some miles from the coast  It
would be vain to attempt numbering those which are precious to the
agriculturist  they are many hundreds  if not thousands

The largest  and most important river on the island  is that of
SÃ³lo   or as it is termed by the natives   Beng Ã¡wan   the great
SÃ³lo   which takes its rise in the district of  KadÃ¡wang   and after
collecting the waters of the surrounding hills  becomes a stream of
considerable depth and breadth at  SÃºra kÃ©rta   where it is further
increased by the waters collected from the adjacent districts  Its
general course from the capital is in an east north easterly direction
till it discharges itself by two principal outlets into the sea  near
GrÃ©sik  and  SidÃ¡yu   After leaving  MatÃ¡rem   it traverses the
provinces of  SukawÃ¡ti    JagarÃ¡ga    MÃ¡dion    JÃ­pang    BlÃ³ra
TÃºban    SidÃ¡yu   and  GrÃ©sik

At  Awi   near the boundary of  MÃ¡dion  and  JagarÃ¡ga   on the eastern
side of the river  a large branch from the south eastern provinces
commonly called the river of  MÃ¡dion   unites itself with that of
SÃ³lo   and from hence its course  which in various places has been
rapid  and in a few places impeded with rocks  is calm  regular  and
steady to its discharge  It has been estimated  that the extent of the
windings of this river is not less than three hundred and fifty six
English miles  from  SÃºra kÃ©rta  to  GrÃ©sik   which in the chart only
gives a straight line of one hundred and forty English miles  and
during its whole course no serious impediment appears to its navigation

This river is of great importance to the inland trade of many of the
eastern provinces  During the rainy season  boats of considerable size
convey the produce of an extensive tract of country to the sea  and
except during the months of August  September  and October  and in
seasons uncommonly dry  it bears down boats of middling or small size
during the whole year  from a considerable distance above  SÃºra kÃ©rta
The boats employed in the navigation of the river are of very different
sizes  and of a peculiar construction  they are very long in proportion
to their breadth  have flat bottoms  and draw very little water  Those
generally used in conveying the produce from one village to another
in the vicinity of  SÃºra kÃ©rta   carry only a few tons  and have a
temporary covering of straw mats  or  kÃ¡jang   others  more carefully
constructed  have a regular roof of planks and a chamber or cabin
which can be closed  and convey from fifty to one hundred tons  These
are generally used by individuals in their adventures to  GrÃ©sik  and
SurabÃ¡ya   The largest  which are the property of the prince  load
nearly two hundred tons  They are employed in transporting the produce
of several of the interior provinces  consisting chiefly of pepper and
coffee  to  GrÃ©sik   and return laden with salt and foreign merchandize
for the consumption of the interior  They require a considerable depth
of water  and can only pass when the river is swollen by continued
rains  They mostly depart from  SÃºra kÃ©rta  in the month of January
Their course down the river is rapid  they generally arrive at  GrÃ©sik
in eight days  but they can perform but one voyage in a season  as they
require nearly four months to work up the stream

The river of  SurabÃ¡ya   the second in magnitude of the whole island
rises near  BÃ¡tu   in the vicinity of the southern hills of the
mountain  ArjÃºna   It is near its source called  KÃ¡li brÃ¡ntas   Near
the capital of  MÃ¡lang  it receives two streams from the eastward
There it first takes its course through the most southern provinces of
the island  when winding round the mountain  KÃ¡wi  it returns again to
the north  receiving near its curvature numerous augmentations from
the southern ridge of mountains  The chief of these is the  LÃ©sti
a considerable river coming from the east  which joins it near the
boundary of  MÃ¡lang  and  SerÃ­ng at   Continuing its course in a
northern direction  it traverses the provinces of  RÃ³wo  and  KedÃ­ri
being joined on the way by the river  RÃ³wo   here it attains its utmost
magnitude  and is distinguished by the name of  Beng Ã¡wan KedÃ­ri   From
the capital of this district to its mouths  it is navigable for boats
of very considerable size  and its course is steady and uninterrupted
Having crossed the district of  WirasÃ¡ba  and  JÃ¡pan   it enters that
of  SurabÃ¡ya   It discharges itself into the ocean by five outlets
which form as many separate rivers  The first of them  taking an
easterly course  is called the river  PÃºnong   then follow those of
Tang golÃ¡ng ing    SÃ­do kÃ©ri    KedÃ³ng   and lastly of  WÃ³no krÃ³no
which again subdividing sends off the branch which passes  SurabÃ¡ya

Several smaller rivers  which fall into the sea between  SemÃ¡rang  and
LÃ¡sem   are highly important for the conveyance of teak timber from
the central forests to the coast  and the waters from some of them
being directed into canals  particularly through the low district of
DemÃ¡k   tend considerably to increase the inland navigation of the
country

In the western districts  the principal rivers which discharge
themselves into the sea on the northern coast are the  ChikÃ¡ndi
which forms the present boundary between Bantam and the environs of
Batavia  the  Chi dÃ¡ni   which discharges itself below  TÃ¡ng ran
the  Chi tÃ¡rom   which falls into the sea below  KrÃ¡wang   and the
Chi mÃ¡nok   which forms the present boundary between  DramÃ¡yu
and  ChÃ©ribon   The principal rivers which discharge themselves by
the south coast are the  Chi mandÃ­ri   which falls into the sea at
PalÃ¡buan rÃ¡tu   or Wyn Coops Bay  the  Chi tÃ¡ndui   which disembogues
near  NÃºsa kambÃ¡ng an   and the  SerÃ¡yu   which taking its rise in
the mountain  DÃ­eng  or  PrÃ¡hu   traverses the rich districts of
BÃ¡nyumas   and falls into the sea a short distance to the east of
ChelÃ¡chap   but these rivers  though of considerable depth  are choked
up at their mouths by heavy banks or bars  and in consequence of the
heavy surf which constantly breaks on the southern coast  are dangerous
at their entrance

Along the northern coast  almost every district has its principal
river  and most of them are navigable up to the maritime capitals
for native vessels of considerable burthen  but they all have the
disadvantage of being partially blocked up at their discharge by
extensive bars and mud banks  an evil which is extending with the
increase of agriculture  by reason of the quantify of soil necessarily
washed down in the process of irrigating the land for the rice
cultivation  Most of them require the application of jetties or piers
to deepen the passages at their entrance

There are no lakes of any considerable size on Java  for that name
cannot be given to the  rÃ¡was   or swamps  which though swelled to
a considerable size in the wet season  are for the rest of the year
either dried up or choked by vegetation  Of this description are
two extensive tracts  one inland of  JapÃ¡ra   usually termed by the
Dutch the  Binnen Zee   or inland sea  and another in the district
of  SemÃ¡rang   In  BÃ¡glen  also  one of the native provinces on the
southern side of the island  there is a lake which supplies the
neighbouring country with fish  and along the coast of which a traffic
is carried on in boats

Extensive swamps are also found in some parts of the native provinces
and in the mountainous districts of the  SÃºnda  country  Several very
beautiful lakes  of small dimensions  are discovered among the hills
and some of them can evidently be shown to have been formed of the
craters of extinct volcanos

The general aspect of Java on the northern coast is low  in many places
swampy and overgrown with mangrove trees and bushes  particularly
towards the west  The southern coast  on the contrary  consists almost
entirely of a series of rocks and cliffs  which rise perpendicularly
to a considerable height  In the interior  stupendous mountains
stretch longitudinally throughout the island  while others of an
inferior elevation  and innumerable ranges of hills running in
various directions  serve to form and confine plains and valleys of
various elevations and extent  On the northern side  the ascent is in
general very gradual  from the sea coast to the immediate base of the
mountains  particularly in the western parts of the island  where it
has the greatest breadth  and where the mountains are situated far
inland  In approaching the mountains  which lie at the back of Batavia
there is a gradual but almost imperceptible acclivity for about forty
miles  In other parts  where the mountains and hills approach nearer to
the coast  the ascent is of course more abrupt  as may be observed in
the vicinity of  SemÃ¡rang

Although the northern coast is in many parts flat and uninteresting
the interior and southern provinces  from the mountainous character
of the country  may be reckoned amongst the most romantic and highly
diversified in the world  uniting all the rich and magnificent scenery
which waving forests  never failing streams  and constant verdure can
present  heightened by a pure atmosphere and the glowing tints of a
tropical sun

The largest of the elevated plains are  in the west  that of  BÃ¡ndung
formed between the two ranges of volcanos which branch off from the
foot of the mountain  GedÃ©   and in the east  those usually termed
the plains of  SÃ³lo  and  KedÃ­ri   which extend along the central
districts from the  MerÃ¡pi  to  KedÃ­ri  and the site of the ancient
capital of  MejapÃ¡hit   These are of considerable magnitude  and with
the exception of the valley of  KedÃº  and the province of  BÃ¡nyumas
through which the beautiful river of  SerÃ¡yu  bends its winding and
romantic course  are perhaps the richest parts of the island  The
low lands  however  are not without their claims to that distinction
especially the flats of  DemÃ¡k   once an extensive swamp  and the Delta
of  SurabÃ¡ya   Large tracts  particularly in the mountainous ranges
of the western districts  still remain in a state of nature  or where
the ground has been once cleared of forest  are now overrun with long
and rank grass  In the central and eastern districts  the country is
comparatively well clothed with cultivation

Quitting the low coast of the north  in many parts unhealthy  the
traveller can hardly advance five miles inland without feeling a
sensible improvement in the atmosphere and climate  As he proceeds
at every step he breathes a purer air and surveys a brighter scene
At length he reaches the highlands  Here the boldest forms of nature
are tempered by the rural arts of man  stupendous mountains clothed
with abundant harvest  impetuous cataracts tamed to the peasant s
will  Here is perpetual verdure  here are tints of the brightest hue
In the hottest season  the air retains its freshness  in the driest
the innumerable rills and rivulets preserve much of their water  This
the mountain farmer directs in endless conduits and canals to irrigate
the land  which he has laid out in terraces for its reception  it then
descends to the plains  and spreads fertility wherever it flows  till
at last  by numerous outlets  it discharges itself into the sea

Almost all the mountains or volcanos  in the large series before
noticed  are found on examination to have the same general
constitution  they are striped vertically by sharp ridges  which  as
they approach the foot of the mountain  take a more winding course
These ridges alternate with valleys  whose sides are of a very various
declivity  Large rocks of basaltes occasionally project  and in several
instances the valleys form the beds of rivers towards the tops of the
volcanos  in the rainy season they all convey large volumes of water

Next in importance to this extensive series of primary mountains
there are various ridges of smaller mountains  or hills  extending
in different directions  with nearly an equal degree of elevation
sometimes originating from or connected with the primary volcanos
sometimes forming independent ranges  and arising separately and at a
distance from the great series  These  which have been termed secondary
mountains  though evidently of a volcanic nature  differ in many
particulars of their constitution from those of the larger series  They
generally extend in long narrow ridges  with but a moderate elevation
and their sides are less regularly composed of the vertical ridges
above mentioned  In most cases  a stratified structure and submarine
origin may be discovered  They are generally covered with large
rocks of basaltes  and in some instances they consist of wacken and
hornblende  which is found along their base in immense piles

Hills of calcareous constitution  with only a moderate degree of
elevation  occur in smaller ridges  often with a flat or tabular top
or in steep rocks and eminences  These are sometimes found in the
centre of the island  covering the volcanic districts  but much more
frequently near the northern and southern shores

Hills of a mixed nature  partly calcareous and partly volcanic  are
also found  The southern coast of the island consists almost entirely
of them  rising in many places to the perpendicular height of eighty
or one hundred feet  and sometimes much higher  These  as they branch
inward and approach the central or higher districts  gradually
disappear  and give place to the volcanic series  or alternate with
huge masses of basaltic hornblende  that appears to assume a regular
stratification  At the base of these  or in the beds of the rivers
which proceed from them  are frequently found various silicious stones
as common flints  prase  hornstone  jasper  porphyry  agate  cornelian
c

Alluvial districts  evidently of recent origin  are noticed in several
parts of the island  These are formed from the sediment and near
the discharge of large rivers  and at the borders of the calcareous
ridges  which are in many instances partially covered by them  their
boundary can easily be traced  and most of them are still in a state
of constant progression  Among other phenomena are mineral wells of
various temperature and impregnation  wells of naphtha  or petroleum
and rivers arising  in a few instances  from the craters of volcanos
impregnated with sulphureous acid 24

From these  and all other investigations yet made  the constitution
of Java appears to be exclusively volcanic  From the vast Asiatic
chain of mountains  one branch of which terminates in Ceylon  proceeds
another  which traversing Arakan  Pegu  and the Malayan peninsula
extends to Sumatra   BÃ¡nka   and  BÃ­liton   where it may be said to
disappear  On Java no granite has been discovered  In its constitution
as in its direction  it may be considered as the first of a series of
volcanic islands  which extend nearly eastward from the Straits of
Sunda for about twenty five degrees

At what period the island assumed its present shape  or whether it
was once joined to Sumatra and  BÃ¡li   is matter for conjecture  The
violent convulsions which these islands have so often suffered  justify
a conclusion that the face of the country has been frequently changed
and tradition mentions the periods when Java was separated from those
islands  25  but the essential difference which has been found in
the mineralogical constitution of Java and Sumatra  would seem to
indicate a different origin  and to support the opinion that those two
islands were never united  Whether  at a period more remote  the whole
Archipelago formed part of the continent of Asia  and was divided from
it and shattered into islands  whether they were originally distinct
from the main land  or whether they were formed at the same time  or
subsequently  are questions we cannot resolve  Yet  when we reflect on
the violence of those dreadful phenomena 26  which have occurred in
our own times in the smaller islands of the volcanic series  and view
this range  as it is now presented to us on the map of the world  a
conjecture might perhaps be hazarded  that the whole may have once
formed but the southern side of one large island or continent  within
which much of the main land has fallen in  and subsequently disappeared
on the influx of the sea

The constitution of the island is unfavourable to metals  All the
examinations hitherto made confirm this assertion  and it may be laid
down as a general position  that no metals occur  in such a quantity
or with such richness of ore  as to reward the operations of the
miner  The only notice we have of the existence of gold or silver is
contained in the first volume of the Transactions of the Batavian
Society  and the attempts on the mountain of  PÃ¡rang   in 1723  and on
the  MÃ©gemÃ©ndung   in 1744  were soon abandoned  Iron pyrites is found
in small quantity in several districts  as well as red ochre  which
however  often contains so little iron  as scarcely to serve for the
common purpose of paint  The existence of mercury in the low lands
of  DÃ©mak   where it is distributed in minute particles through the
clay of the rice grounds bounding one of the principal rivers of that
district  has not been considered as an indication of a mine  or of the
ores of that metal

No diamonds are found  nor other precious stones  but many minerals
of the schorl  quartz  potstone  feldspar  and trap kind  They mostly
exist in mountains of secondary elevation  towards the southern shores
of the island  sometimes in extensive veins  but separate fragments
are carried down by the rivers  and found far from their original
deposition  Prase is found in very extensive veins  hornstone is also
abundant in particular situations  as well as flint  chalcedony
hyalite  common jasper  jasper agate  obsidian  and porphyry

The soil in Java is for the most part rich  and remarkable for its
depth  probably owing to the exclusively volcanic constitution of the
country  and the constant accession of new mould  which is washed down
the side of its numerous mountains  It has the character of being in a
high degree richer than the ordinary soil of the Malayan countries in
general  particularly of Sumatra and the Malayan peninsula  The best
soil resembles the richest garden mould of Europe  and whenever it can
be exposed to the inundation necessary for the rice crop  requires
no manure  and will bear without impoverishment  one heavy and one
light crop in the year  the poorest  with this advantage  will yield
a liberal return to the husbandman  In an island of such extent and
variety of surface  the soil is necessarily various  but its general
character is that of extraordinary fertility  The red and very light
soil of the western districts is generally considered inferior to the
dark brown and stiffer soil which prevails in the eastern  The best
soil is usually found near the beds of rivers  in the valleys  and on
the slopes of the largest mountains  the worst on the ranges of low
calcareous hills  which run through different parts of the island

The seasons  in all the countries situated within about ten degrees of
the equator  agree in this  that as one eternal summer prevails  they
are not distinguished as hot and cold  but as wet and dry  On Java the
seasons depend upon the periodical winds  The period of the setting
in of these winds is not determined within a few weeks  but generally
the westerly winds  which are always attended with rain  are felt in
October  become more steady in November and December  and gradually
subside  till in March or April they are succeeded by the easterly
winds and fair weather  which continue for the remaining half year
The heaviest rains are in the months of December and January  and the
driest weather is in July and August  at which latter period  also  the
nights are coldest and the days hottest  The weather is most unsettled
when the season is changing  particularly at the first setting in of
the westerly winds  but those violent storms and hurricanes  which are
so often felt in the West Indies and in higher latitudes  are here
unknown  With the exception of a few days at these periods  or when
the westerly winds are at their height  vessels of any description may
ride in safety in most of the bays along the northern coast of the
island  and on shore  the wind is never so violent as to do damage
Thunder storms are  however  frequent  and the lightning is extremely
vivid  In the vicinity of the hills  and elsewhere during the dry
season  seldom a day passes without thunder and lightning  and although
these grand exhibitions of nature cause less consternation in general
within the tropics than beyond them  it cannot be denied that they are
destructive of many lives  Earthquakes are to be expected in a volcanic
country  and are frequent in the vicinity of the volcanos  but the
European towns have never sustained any serious injury from them

During the rainy season there are many days free from showers  The
mornings are generally clear  and although the rains sometimes continue
without intermission for several days  and frequently fall in torrents
they are not marked on Java by that decided character  either of
permanence or violence  which distinguishes the periodical rains of
the continent of India  neither is the dry season distinguished by
that excessive aridity which attends the hot seasons of that country
Even in July and August  the atmosphere is refreshed by occasional
showers  and the landscape is at all times of the year covered with the
brightest verdure  The thermometer of Fahrenheit has been known to rise
along the northern coast as high as 90  about three in the afternoon
and even higher  particularly in the large and low capitals of Batavia
SemÃ¡rang   and  SurabÃ¡ya   but from observations made during a course
of some years at Batavia  and published under the authority of the
Dutch government  it has been found usually to range between 70 and
74  in the evenings and mornings  and to stand about 83  at noon  By
similar observations at  SemÃ¡rang   the same thermometer  placed in a
spacious and open apartment  has averaged 87   at noon

At a distance inland of not more than thirty or forty miles  where the
ascent is gradual  and of fifteen or twenty or less where it is rapid
the thermometer falls from five to ten degrees lower  At  Chi serÃºa
situated about 40 miles inland of Batavia  and  Chi pÃ¡nas   about
twelve miles further  on the opposite slope of the mountain  GedÃ©   the
thermometer ranges generally between 60 and 70   In the morning  at six
o clock  it is sometimes as low as 57   and in the afternoon  at three
its usual height is from 67 to 70   but seldom rising to 72   On some
of the hills inland of  SemÃ¡rang   on which Europeans frequently reside
during the dry season  at an elevation of about four thousand feet
the thermometer is frequently seen as low as 45   and generally  in the
clear season  ranges from 50 to 62   and on the summit of one of the
mountains   SindÃ³ro   it has been observed as low as 27  27   Ice  as
thick as a Spanish dollar  has been found  and hoar frost  denominated
bÃ³hon Ãºpas   or the poisonous dew  has been observed on the trees and
vegetation of some of the higher regions

By its insular situation  the climate of Java enjoys the benefit of
land and sea breezes  which in its least favoured parts subdue the
fierceness of the tropical rays  while the great elevation of its
interior affords the rare advantage  that from the sea shore up to the
tops of the mountains  there is  almost from one end of the island to
the other  a regular diminution of the temperature  at the rate of two
or three degrees of Fahrenheit for every ten miles

The general inference which has been drawn by professional men
from the experience which the occupation of Java by the British has
afforded  is  that with the exception of the town of Batavia  and some
parts of the northern coast  the island of Java stands on a level  in
point of salubrity  with the healthiest parts of British India  or of
any tropical country in the world

The principal stations of the British army  composed of Europeans and
Sepoys  were at Weltevreden  within three miles of the town of Batavia
and at  SemÃ¡rang  and  SurabÃ¡ya   spots certainly less favourable to
health than the rest of the island taken generally  but detachments
from it have occasionally done duty in every district of the island

The tables included in the Appendix 28   will shew  that
notwithstanding the troops laboured under many disadvantages and
privations  in point of accommodation   c  to which they would not
have been subjected in a more permanent settlement  and that they were
otherwise exposed to diseases unconnected with those of the climate
the average casualties were not excessive  From the 1st November  1813
to the same month in 1814  the average number of troops is stated to
have been 7 470  the deaths 504  making a proportion of 1 to 14 8  the
average number of sick in the same period was 862  making a proportion
of sick to well as 1 to 8  From the beginning of November 1814 to the
same month in 1815  out of an average number of troops stationed in
different parts of the island  in corps and detachments  amounting to
7 487  there were 252 deaths  63 of which were caused by fever  123 by
dysentery  and 65 by other diseases  making an average number of deaths
of 21 per month  or in the proportion of one death to thirty men in
the year  a proportion not exceeding that of some of the healthiest
possessions in temperate climates

To this general result may be added the comparative casualties in his
Majesty s 78th regiment  during the period of its being stationed in
India and Java  This regiment has occasionally been cantoned at each of
the principal stations  and has remained on the island from the first
conquest of Java  By the table will be seen the number of rank and file
of which this regiment consisted at different periods  since 1797 to
1815  and the number of casualties in the same periods  It might not be
proper to select the years in which it landed on the continent of India
or on Java  but those in which it was stationed in either country may
be brought together  as fit subjects for comparison  By calculation
upon the data of the table  it will appear  that from December 1800 to
December 1801  the deaths were to the number of troops as 1 to about
20   in 1801 2  as 1 to 12  in 1803 4  as 1 to 5   in 1804 5  as 1 to
8   in 1805  as 1 to about 20  in 1806 7  as 1 to 28 nearly  in 1807 8
as 1 to 24   in 1809 10  as 1 to about 23  in 1811 12  as 1 to 3
in 1813 14  as 1 to 6  and in 1814 15  as 1 to about 20 nearly  The
places at which the regiment was stationed at these different periods
will be seen by the table  and the cause of the unusual mortality
that prevailed in 1811 12  and which exceeds any of the years on the
continent  will be found in an extract from the letter of Dr  Currie
the surgeon  inclosing the return  The mortality in the last year was
as 1 to 20 in the regiment  and among the whole troops  according to
the data above  as 1 to about 30  a low estimate for climates  whose
characters stand higher for salubrity than that of Java

That the climate of Java  in general  is congenial to the human frame
at least to that of an Asiatic  is corroborated by the great extent of
its native population  compared with that of the surrounding islands
notwithstanding the checks which it experienced both from the native
princes and the European government  and the convincing proof which
the records of the British army now afford  are perhaps sufficient to
remove the unfavourable impression which existed against the climate of
the island  as affecting Europeans

At the same time  however  that Java has to boast this general
character of high salubrity  comparatively with other tropical
climates  it is not to be denied that there are some spots upon
it which are decidedly unhealthy  These are to be found along the
low swampy marshes of the northern coast  which are mostly recent
encroachments upon the sea  the principal of these is Batavia  the long
established capital of the Dutch eastern empire

The climate of this city has ever been considered as one of the most
baneful in the world  It has even been designated the storehouse of
disease  with how much justice  is too woefully demonstrated by the
writings of those visitors who have survived its perils  and the
records of the Dutch East India Company itself  If we may credit
Raynal  29  there perished between the years 1714 and 1776  in the
hospitals of Batavia  above eighty seven thousand sailors and soldiers
From the table  No  1  imperfect as it is  on account of the loss of
many of the registers at the period of the British conquest  it will be
seen what a large proportion the deaths bore to the whole population
and from the table  No  2  of the same Appendix  discovered among the
Dutch records  it appears further  that the total amount of deaths in
this city  from the year 1730 to the year 1752  was in twenty two years
more than a million of souls

To those who are acquainted with the manner in which the affairs of
the Dutch East India Company were managed abroad  there will perhaps
be no difficulty in laying rather at the door of the colonists  than
of the nation  the crime of maintaining a commercial monopoly  at such
a dreadful expence of lives as resulted from confining the European
population within the narrow walls of this unhealthy city  That the
sacrifice was made for that object  or to speak more correctly  under
that pretext  for the private interests of the colonists who were
entrusted with its details  can scarcely be doubted  From the moment
the walls of the city were demolished  the draw bridges let down  and
free egress and ingress to and from the country was permitted  the
population began to migrate to a more healthy spot  and they had not
to go above one or two miles beyond the precincts before they found
themselves in a different climate  But this indulgence  as it gave the
inhabitants a purer air  so it gave them a clearer insight into the
resources of the country  and notions of a freer commerce  which  of
all things  it was the object of the local government and its officers
to limit or suppress

Necessity might have first determined the choice of the spot for the
European capital  but a perseverance in the policy of confining the
European population within its walls  after so many direful warnings
of its insalubrity  cannot but lead to the inference  that either the
monopoly of the trade was considered a greater object to the nation
than the lives of the inhabitants  or that the more liberal views of
the government were defeated by the weakness or corruption of its
agents

Of the vegetable and animal kingdoms  as of the mineral  we shall
content ourselves with such an account as may be necessary to convey
to the reader a general notion of the nature of the country and its
resources  referring the man of science to the intended publication of
Dr  Thomas Horsfield  a gentleman whose sole attention has  for the
last seven years  been directed to the natural history of Java

Java is distinguished not only by the abundance of its vegetation
but by its extraordinary variety  Upwards of a thousand plants are
already contained in the herb area of Dr  Horsfield  of which a large
proportion are new to the naturalist  Between the tops of the mountains
and the sea shore  Java may be considered as possessing at least six
distinct climates  each furnishing a copious indigenous botany  while
the productions of every region in the world may find a congenial spot
somewhere in the island

Vegetable productions  which contribute to the food and sustenance of
man  are found in great variety  Of these the most important is rice
which forms the staple grain of the country  and of which there are
upwards of a hundred varieties  Maize  or Indian corn  ranks next  and
is principally cultivated in the higher regions  or in those tracts
where the soil is unfavourable to the rice cultivation  The bean  or
kÃ¡chang   of which there are many varieties  is an important article
of food  Of the sugar cane  which is used by the natives only in its
raw state  they distinguish eight varieties  an account of which  as
well as of the cultivation of coffee  pepper  indigo  tobacco   c  will
be found in the chapter on agriculture  Aniseed   mÃºngsi   cummin seed
mÃ¡rÃ­cha   black pepper    chÃ¡bi jÃ¡wa   long pepper    kumÃºkus
cubebs   socha dolichos  and  mendÃ©king   plants of considerable
importance  may be considered as indigenous to the island  and are
collected for various uses in diet and medicine

Besides the cocoa nut and other productions more generally known
there are many trees growing spontaneously  of which the seeds and
kernels are used as food  the principal of these are the  petÃ©
jÃ©ngkol   and  kÃ³mlandÃ­ngan   several species of the mimosa  and the
pÃºchang  and  kamÃ­ri   The bread fruit tree grows on Java  and is of
the same species  although inferior in quality  with that of the South
Sea Islands  but the fruit is comparatively very little esteemed or
employed as an article of food

Of tuberous roots  besides those furnished from the principal genera
convolvulus  dioscorea  and arum  are those from the  bangkwang
dolichos bulbosus   the roots of which are much esteemed by the
natives  and the  kÃ©ntang jÃ¡wa   ocymum tuberosum  or Java potatoe
Most of the numerous varieties of the convolvulus and dioscorea  which
furnish food for the natives  have been enumerated in one of the first
volumes of the Batavian Transactions  The jatropha manihot  called  Ãºwi
blanda   or  wÃºdo   has been propagated through all parts of Java  and
is found growing in the hedges

The true sago of Amboina and the Eastern Islands  is found only
solitary in a few low and marshy situations  and the preparation
of it from the pith of the tree is not known to the inhabitants of
Java  the leaves only are employed for covering houses  but from the
Ã¡ren   or sagurus rumphii  which grows abundantly in every part of
the island  and on account of its variously extensive uses  ranks next
in importance to the cocoa nut  a substance is prepared  similar in
all respects to the true sago of the Eastern Islands  The tops of
various trees of the palm kind  which are sought after in other parts
of the East as food  are  on account of the abundance of rice and other
esculent vegetables  but little regarded in Java  but the young shoots
of many varieties of the  bambu  are used in the diet of the natives
Wheat and potatoes  with almost every species of European vegetables
are cultivated with success  Of the oil giving plants a particular
account will be given when describing the agriculture of the country

Java  in common with the Malayan islands in general  abounds in
indigenous fruits   No region of the earth   observes Mr  Marsden
can boast an equal abundance and variety of indigenous fruits   The
mangÃºstin   which on account of its acknowledged pre eminence amongst
Indian fruits  has been termed the pride of these countries  the
durian   or  dÃºren   to which the natives of these islands are so
passionately attached  the  rÃ¡mbutan   the  lÃ¡nseh  or  lÃ¡nseb   with
an extensive variety of the jack  the mango  the plantain  the guava
the pine apple  the papaw  the custard apple  the pomegranate  and
almost every species of fruit which grows within the tropics  are here
found in the greatest variety  The tamarind tree is general  The island
also produces many kinds of oranges  citrons  lemons  and in particular
the pumplemous  known in Bengal under the name of the Batavian lembu
or lime  and in the West Indies as the shaddock   besides the  sÃ¡wu
klÃ©dung    pachÃ­tan   and a variety of others  not generally known
to Europeans  but well calculated for the table  Of the mango  at
least forty varieties are enumerated  the wild raspberry  which is
found in the higher regions  is not destitute of flavour  one kind  in
particular  with dark violet coloured fruit  approaches in taste to the
European species  In some of the mountainous tracts are to be found
peaches  Chinese pears  and some other fruits imported from Japan  the
Cape of Good Hope  and China

Among innumerable flowers which bloom in perpetual succession
throughout the year  and impregnate the air of these countries with
their fragrance  those of the  champÃ¡ka    tÃ¡n jong    melÃ¡ti
kanÃ¡ng a  and  nÃ¡gasÃ¡ri   hold the first rank  they are used by the
natives in the ornament of their persons  and are remarkable for their
fragrance  The myrtle and rose are found in the gardens of Europeans
A great variety of ornamental trees and shrubs  many of them overlooked
in the catalogues of Rhumphius and Van Rheede  have been noticed  as
deserving cultivation for their utility as well as beauty

The medicinal plants of Java have been described in an account
published in the Batavian Transactions  among these are many which
are employed in the daily practice of the natives  of which a large
proportion have not been subjects of investigation or experiment
by Europeans  and others which had not previously been botanically
described or classed  In a country hitherto imperfectly explored
and abounding in profuse vegetation  it was natural to calculate on
the discovery of many useful medicinal plants  and among upwards of
sixty  described  for the first time  by Dr  Horsfield  he particularly
notices several  as likely to become most valuable articles in general
medicinal practice

Besides abundance of coir  termed  sepÃ©t  by the natives  prepared from
the fibres which surround the cocoa nut  and gamuti  called  duk
prepared from those of the  Ã¡ren  tree  both of which are well known
another species of palm  the  gebÃ¡ng   also yields valuable ropes
the fibre of which is obtained from the large petioles or stalks of
the leaves by pounding and beating  Intelligent natives assert  that
ropes prepared from these are particularly valuable  exceeding in
strength all other kinds of equal size  The fibres and ropes are called
bas   The cotton shrub  gossypium herbaceum  is universal  and hemp
though its uses are unknown to the Javans  is found in the gardens
of foreign settlers  Besides these  the island affords various kinds
of vegetables  the fibrous bark of which is made into thread  rope
cloth   c   but they are never cultivated  and when required for use
are collected in their wild state  The general denomination  in the
Javan language  of the internal bark of all vegetables which can be
manufactured into cords  thread   c  is  lÃºlub   This being freed  by
beating or maceration  from the adhering particles of the exterior
bark  yields the fibrous substance  which is twisted by the most simple
process  commonly by the hands alone  The trees which afford the
lÃºlub  are the  wÃ¡ru   which is very abundant  and is manufactured
into ropes for all common domestic purposes  the  melÃ­nju   the bark
of which is called  bÃ¡gu   and the  bÃ©ndo   which affords ropes of
superior strength and durability

Of the bambusa  the  pring Ã¡pus   the stem of which may be considered
arborescent  furnishes the cheapest ropes  These are made with great
expedition  being split into thin strips  which are twisted on the spot
into cords fit for all common purposes  although they are serviceable
only for a few days  They are uniformly used  in travelling  for
securing baggage   c  Among shrubs principally employed for these
purposes are the  werÃºng    urÃ­s urÃ­san    dalÃºmpang    che plÃ¡kan
and  glÃºgo   among plants  the  widÃºri  and  rÃ¡mi   the fibres of the
latter afford very strong and durable cords  which are chiefly employed
for nets or lines  and used in fishing  they greatly resemble the
sunn of western India  and would probably be found to answer the same
purpose  as well in furnishing the bags called in India gunny bags
for the transportation of goods  as for the manufacture of paper in
Europe  This remark applies also to the  lÃºlub  of several of the other
shrubs mentioned  Several species of  pÃ­sang  or plantain yield the
materials for ropes and cords of various fineness  according to the
methods employed in preparing them  In the Manilla Islands  cables
are made from these fibres  and in the first volume of the Batavian
Transactions a mode is described of preparing from them a substance
resembling cotton  The leaves of the   nanas   or pine apple  contain
also abundance of useful fibres  which are easily separated in a
bundle  after scraping off the coriaceous substance  It is very fine
and the separate fibres are employed by the natives in sewing without
any preparation  but it may also be spun  and is made into a kind of
stuff resembling silk  gauze   c

Mats are made from several species of pandanus  from a kind of grass
called  mÃ©ndong   and from the leaves of various palms  particularly
the  gebÃ¡ng   The latter affords the most common kinds  coarser and
less durable than the others  as well as bags  straw sacks  resembling
very coarse mats

The paper in common use with the Javans is manufactured from the
glÃºgo    morus papyrifera

A variety of vegetable substances are used in dyeing  the principal
of which  however  are the  tom   or indigo  which is extensively
cultivated throughout the island  and the  wong kÃºdu   which affords
a lasting scarlet  A black dye is obtained from the bark of several
exotic trees  united with the rind of the  mangÃºstin  fruit  A yellow
dye is also obtained from an exotic wood  heightened by the addition of
the bark of the  nÃ¡ngka  tree  and a variety of the mango

Extensive forests of the  jÃ¡ti   or teak of India 30   are found in
almost all the eastern provinces  but the most valuable and important
are in the central districts  situated inland  between  SemÃ¡rang  and
SidÃ¡yu   and particularly in the districts of  BlÃ³ra    JÃ­pang   and
PadÃ¡ng an

Of the teak tree there is but one species known  the tectona grandis
of LinnÃ¦us  the tekka of Van Rheede  and the jatus of Rhumphius
Its natural history has been already fully detailed  and all the
kinds generally enumerated are merely varieties  These are usually
distinguished among the natives of Java by names derived from the
quality and colour of the wood  The principal are the  jÃ¡ti kÃ¡pur
the chalky teak  and a kind varying in colour  and on account of
its excellence termed  jÃ¡ti sÃºng gu   or the true teak  The former
is the most common  its wood is of a whitish hue  and it sometimes
contains calcareous concretions in nodules or streaks  This sort is
chiefly employed for common domestic purposes  and though inferior
in quality to many others  from its abundance and comparative
cheapness  is perhaps the most generally useful  The  jÃ¡ti sÃºng gu
is harder  closer  and more ponderous  and particularly selected for
ship building  The colour of the wood is of different shades  from
light to intense brown  with a cast of violet verging sometimes to red
or black  If the stem is covered with spines  or rather pointed scales
it is called  jÃ¡ti dÃºri   but in its texture and quality it agrees with
the  jÃ¡ti sÃºnge gu   Besides these the natives distinguish  as  jÃ¡ti
gÃ©mbol   those excrescences or protuberances which are produced from a
variety of the  jÃ¡ti   furnishing materials for handsome cabinet work

The teak tree on Java grows at a moderate elevation above the level
of the ocean  It is generally conceived  that the timber afforded by
forests growing on a soil of which the basis is limestone  and the
surface uneven  gravelly  or rocky  is the hardest  the freest from
chalky concretions  and in all respects the best  but in laying out
a teak plantation  a soil consisting in a great proportion of black
vegetable mould  is always selected for the purpose of obtaining a
rapid growth  The teak tree is slender and erect  It shoots up with
considerable vigour and rapidity  but its expansion is slow  Like all
other trees affording useful timber of a close grain  it is many years
in arriving at maturity  Under favourable circumstances  a growth of
from twenty to twenty five years affords a tree having about twelve
inches diameter at the base  It requires at least a century to attain
its perfection  but for common purposes  it is usually felled when
between thirty and fifty years old 31

Notwithstanding the extent to which cultivation has been carried in
many districts of the island  large portions of its surface are still
covered with primeval forests  affording excellent timber of various
descriptions  Besides the teak  there are several kinds of wood or
timber employed for various domestic purposes  as the  sÃºren   the tuna
of Bengal   of which the wood is very light  stronger and more durable
than all other kinds of similar weight produced on the island  as the
grain is not fine  it is not employed in making furniture  but it is
useful for chests  trunks  carriages   c   its colour is red  and its
odour somewhat resembling that of the cedar  Its weight is probably
inferior to that of the larch   The  wÃºngÃº  or  ketÃ¡ngi  is often used
instead of teak  the grain is somewhat finer  when in full blossom it
is perhaps the most beautiful tree existing   The  wÃ¡dang  or  bÃ¡yur
a light and tolerably durable wood  is employed for masts and spars
of small vessels  but the surface must be well covered with resinous
substances to prevent its splitting   The  gintÃºngan  is employed in
the same manner  but grows to a larger size  the colour of the wood
and bark is red   The  lampÃ©an  or  lÃ¡ban  is light but durable  and
affords materials for the handles of the spears or pikes borne by the
natives   The  nÃ¡ngka  abounds in several districts where teak is not
found  and is almost exclusively used in the construction of houses
and other domestic purposes  the wood is more close and ponderous
than the  sÃºren   which it otherwise resembles  it takes a tolerable
polish  and is sometimes employed for furniture  The colour is yellow
but it is made to receive a brownish hue  by the application of the
young teak leaves in polishing  its bark is used as a yellow dye   The
lÃºren  resembles the  nÃ¡ngka   but is generally of rare occurrence
though in some tracts it furnishes the only timber  its use in the
neighbouring islands  particularly on Sumatra  is well known   The
kusÃ¡mbi  is uncommonly heavy  hard  and close  it supplies anchors for
small vessels  blocks  pestles  and numerous similar utensils   The
sÃ¡wur  is a very beautiful and useful wood  the colour resembles that
of mahogany  but the grain is closer  and it is more ponderous  its
chief use is for handles of tools for carpenters and other artificers
for machinery  especially for the teeth of the wheels of mills  and
other purposes where a hard and durable wood is required  On account of
its scarcity  it is uniformly cut down on Java before it arrives at
the necessary size for cabinet work  Forests of it grow on the hills
of  BÃ¡li   opposite the Javan shore  whence it is brought over by
boat loads for sale

The  pÃ­lang  is a very hard wood  and employed in the eastern
districts  instead of lignum vitÃ¦  for the construction of
ships  blocks   c   The  pung  is equally hard  and uniformly employed
by the natives for pegs in constructing their  prahus    The  wÃ¡li
kÃºkun  is equal to the  kusÃ¡mbi  in weight  and exceeds it in hardness
it is employed for anchors  naves of wheels  machinery   c   The
tang gulun  is a hard wood of a close grain  and employed by turners
for various small works   The  kelÃºmpit  is a very large tree  sections
are employed by the natives for cart wheels   The  jÃ¡ran  is a white
wood taking the tool easily  the natives prefer it to all others
for the construction of their saddles  which consist principally of
wood   The  demÃ³lo  affords a light wood  which is made into planks
and employed where durability is not much required   The wood of the
kedÃ¡wung  is whitish and moderately hard   The  lÃ¡ban  is a yellowish
and hard wood  it is employed for the handles of axes and various
utensils   The  jÃ¡nglot  is considered by the natives as the toughest
wood produced in the island  and is always employed for bows when
procurable  the tree is of a moderate size   The  bÃ©ndo  is a light
wood  useful for canoes   The  sÃ©ntul  is a light close grained wood
and easily worked  it resembles the  sÃºren

For household furniture  cabinet ware   c  are employed  the  sÃ³no
kling  of the  MalÃ¡yus   the colour of which is a deep brown
inclining to black   the  sÃ³no kÃ³mbang   which has some resemblance
to the  lingua  wood of the Moluccas   the  war m lot   dark brown
and  prÃ³no sodo   resembling the walnut  both scarce   the  wer n
of a brown colour  of a close substance and light  abundant in some
districts   the  mentÃ¡us  and  jÃºmberit   the wood of which is white
and fine grained  uniformly used for inlaying   the  randu kÃºning
yellowish and close grained   and the  Ã­ng as   of a brownish red
colour  and very brittle

For the hilts and sheaths of krÃ®ses  the natives make use of the
timÃ³ko   of which the black and white variegated fragments are called
pÃ©let   These are of various kinds   The  arÃºman   variegated white
and black  is also employed for canes  handles  and spears   c
and is very heavy   The  tikÃ©   yellowish  closed and marble   the
mÃ¡ngu    the  Ã¡ti Ã¡ti    the  krÃ¡minan    the  pÃºrwo kÃºning  and
several others  are employed for the same purposes   The  kamÃºning  is
of a brownish colour and very fine grain   the  tayÃºman  resembles the
last and is very much esteemed   the  wÃºni stelÃ¡go  affords a reddish
wood

Among the most extensively useful productions ought not to be forgotten
the  bÃ¡mbu   or  prÃ­ng   which abounds on Java  and seems  from the
greater luxuriance and variety by which it is here distinguished  to
find the soil and climate more congenial to its growth than those of
any other country  It blossoms in different parts of the island  The
rattans   rÃ³tan   of Java are on the whole inferior to those of Sumatra
and Borneo  the improved state of cultivation is unfavourable to their
growth and propagation

Many woods afford excellent fuel  The charcoal prepared from the
kusÃ¡mbi  is equal perhaps to that of any other wood with which we are
acquainted  and is universally preferred in cooking  and in the other
branches of domestic economy  Charcoal  for gunpowder  is uniformly
prepared from the celtis orientalis  called  Ã¡ng grung

Among the useful trees must be noticed  the soap tree  of which the
fruit is used to a very great extent in washing linen   the  kasÃ©mak
from the bark of which is made a varnish for umbrellas   the  sÃ¡mpang
from the resin of which the natives prepare a shining varnish for the
wooden sheaths of krÃ®ses   the cotton tree  from which a silky wool is
obtained for stuffing pillows and beds   the wax tree  which  though
scarce on Java  grows abundantly on some parts of MadÃºra   the kernel
by expression  produces an oil  which some time after becomes hard
and bears a resemblance to wax  it may be burnt in lamps or converted
into candles  and affords an agreeable odour   the  bendÃºd   a shrub
producing the substance of which the elastic gum  commonly called
Indian rubber  is prepared  The art of preparing it in this form is
however unknown in Java  Torches are made of it  for the use of those
who search for birds  nests in the rocks  and it serves for winding
round the stick employed to strike musical instruments  as the  gong
c  to soften the sound  The  mÃ­nyak kÃ¡won  or  niÃ¡tu  is a very
useful tree  which grows solitary in all  and abundantly in some parts
of the island  and produces a kind of tallow

DÃ¡mar   or resin  is distinguished by the inhabitants of these
countries into two kinds   dÃ¡mar bÃ¡tu  or  sÃ©la   and  dÃ¡mar puti
comprising numerous varieties obtained from different trees  None of
these are  however  produced on Java  Besides the  rÃ¡samÃ¡la   which is
very limited as to its place of growth  the  CanÃ¡ram   and a peculiar
resin employed by the natives for varnishing the wooden sheaths of
their krÃ®ses  called  sÃ¡mpang   few odoriferous resins are found  The
camphor tree  which abounds on Sumatra and Borneo  is unknown on Java
The wood oil  distinguished among the Malays by the name of  krÃºwing
which in Java is applied to all resinous or oily substances employed
in the construction of vessels   is not a native of Java  but it grows
abundantly on Banka and Sumatra

None of what are called the finer kinds of spices  namely  the nutmeg
clove  and cinnamon  are indigenous to Java  but the few trees which
have been planted in the gardens of Europeans have thriven well  and
from the nature of the soil and climate  there seems little doubt that
the nutmeg and clove  in particular  might be extensively cultivated
throughout the island  did it suit the policy of the European
government to admit of their general introduction

The vine was once extensively cultivated in some of the eastern
provinces of the island  in which the soil and climate appear well
calculated for its growth  but an apprehension  on the part of
the Dutch East India Company  that its cultivation on Java might
interfere with the wine trade of the Cape of Good Hope  induced them
to discourage it  and the preparation of wine from the grape was
strictly prohibited  Lieutenant Colonel Mackenzie  when noticing the
vast quantities of ashes thrown up from the different volcanos  makes
the following observation on the eastern part of Java   The soil of
the country is evidently enriched by the ashes and earth emitted by
these eruptions  and there is reason to conclude  what persons well
acquainted with the south of Europe assert  that the vines of Italy
and the Cape would thrive in perfection  in a soil and climate so well
adapted to them

Among the vegetable productions of Java  none has excited more interest
than the celebrated  Ãºpas   or poison tree  Mr  Marsden  in his history
of Sumatra 32   has referred to various concurring authorities  in
refutation of the very extraordinary tales told of this tree  and  in
this general account of the productions of Java  it may perhaps be
sufficient to refer the reader to the particulars contained in the
subjoined note 33

Of the useful or domestic quadrupeds it may be observed  that neither
the elephant nor the camel is a native of Java  the former is rarely
imported  the latter unknown  Neither the ass nor mule is found  but
the island has a fine breed of small horses   jÃ¡ran    strong  fleet
and well made  A still finer breed is imported from  BÃ­ma   on the
neighbouring island of  SumbÃ¡wa   which by competent judges has been
said to resemble the Arab in every respect except size  They seldom
exceed thirteen hands  and in general are below this standard

The bull and cow   sÃ¡pi  or  lÃ©mbu   are general  but much more so in
the central and eastern districts than in the western  The breed has
been greatly improved by the species introduced from continental India
But the animal of most essential and general use in the agriculture
of the country is the buffalo   kÃ¡bu    maÃ­sa   or  mÃºnding    a
particular account of which will appear in the chapter on Agriculture
Goats   wedÃºs   are numerous and of a small size  sheep  called here
European goats  are scarce and small  As in other sultry climates
the latter have a coarse woollen coat  which is employed for stuffing
saddles  pillows   c  but it is in so little request that the
inhabitants are rarely at the trouble of shearing for it  The hog
 chÃ©leng   is reared principally among the Chinese

Of beasts of prey may be enumerated several species of the tiger  as
the  mÃ¡chan lÃ³reng   felis tigris    mÃ¡chan gogor   a variety    mÃ¡chan
tÃºtul   probably the small leopard of Pennant    mÃ¡chan kombang  and
kÃºwuk   the smallest kind  called tiger cats  The jackal  and several
varieties of the wild dog  as the  Ã¡su wÃ¡war    Ã¡su Ã¡jag   or  Ã¡su
kÃ­ki   and among other wild quadrupeds  the rhinoceros  and  bÃ¡nteng
or wild Javan ox  the wild hog and the stag  the last  as well as the
rib faced and axis deer  is tamed and fattened for food  The aggregate
number of mammalia on Java have been estimated at about fifty  The
habits and manners of the larger animals  the tiger  leopard  black
tiger  rhinoceros and stag  and two species of deer  the varieties of
the wild hog   c  are sufficiently known  but the  bÃ¡nteng   or Javan
ox  the Javan buffalo  the varieties of the wild dog  those of the
weasel and squirrel  and most of the other smaller quadrupeds  still
present curious subjects for the study of the naturalist  Next to
the rhinoceros  which sometimes  though rarely at present  injures
plantations  the wild hogs are the most destructive animals  They are
often poisoned  or intoxicated  according to the quantity they consume
by the  kÃ¡lÃ¡k kÃ¡mbing   or by the remains from the preparation of
brom   The practice of suspending rags impregnated with urine  at
small distances around the plantations  is universal over the whole
island  These animals are said to have so violent an aversion to this
odour  that even this  feeble barrier  is useful in preserving the
plantations

Musk  called  dedes   is procured from the  rasÃ©

Although the same qualities are ascribed to them here as in other
countries  bezoars are comparatively scarce in Java  and those
occasionally found in the maritime capitals are uniformly brought from
other countries  The hog deer and Nicobar pigeon are not natives  and
although wild hogs  in which bezoars are said to be found  are very
abundant  they are never examined or approached by the natives  Every
extraordinary concretion  calculus  ossification   c  found in any part
of an animal  is called  mustÃ­ka   which corresponds to the bezoar of
the Arabs  Persians   c  A concretion of feathers found in the stomach
of a fowl is called  mustÃ­ka Ã¡yam   and is carefully preserved  A
stony concretion  discovered accidentally by the rattling of a human
skull exposed for many years to the action of the sun  has been
denominated  mustÃ­ka Ã³rang   and the most salutary virtues ascribed
to it  Analogous to the bezoars  must be considered the horns of the
rhinoceros  whose virtues are highly prized

Among the domestic fowls  or poultry  are the turkey  which is
comparatively scarce  and chiefly raised for the tables of Europeans
the goose  which is very common near all the establishments of
Europeans  the  bÃ©bek   or duck  abundant in every part of the island
the common fowl and pigeons  Among the birds of prey  the eagle is
not found  but there are several varieties of the falcon  of which
the  jÃ³ko wuru  is the largest  also the carrion crow and the owl
Of the parrot kind  two only  the  bÃ©tet  and  selÃ­ndit   are found
on Java  The peacock   merÃ¡k    is very common in large forests  The
number of distinct species of birds has been estimated not greatly to
exceed two hundred  of which upwards of one hundred and seventy have
been described  and are already contained in the collections made on
account of the English East India Company

The dorsal feathers of the white heron  and the vent feathers of the
sÃ¡ndang lÃ¡wÃ©   are employed  as substitutes for ostrich feathers  by
the natives  for plumes   c  It is very rarely that the feathers of
geese   c  are employed for beds or pillows  the silky cotton of the
kÃ¡pok  being preferred on account of its coolness  For ornamenting the
arrows of the natives  the feathers of some of the falcon tribe are
chiefly employed

Among the interesting subjects which still remain open for search
are the habits and constitution of the hirundo esculenta  the small
swallow which forms the edible nests  annually exported in large
quantities from Java and the Eastern Islands for the Chinese market
These birds not only abound among the cliffs and caverns of the south
coast of the island  but inhabit the fissures and caverns of several
of the mountains and hills in the interior of the country  From every
observation which has been made on Java  it has been inferred  that
the mucilaginous substance  of which the nests are formed  is not  as
has been generally supposed  obtained from the ocean  The birds  it
is true  generally inhabit the caverns in the vicinity of the sea  as
agreeing best with their habits  and affording them the most convenient
retreats for attaching their nests to  but several caverns are found
inland  at a distance of forty or fifty miles from the sea  containing
nests similar to those on the shore  From many of their retreats along
the southern coast  they have been observed to take their flight in
an inland direction  towards the pools  lakes  and extensive marshes
covered with stagnant water  as affording them abundance of their food
which consists of flies  mosquitoes  gnats  and small insects of every
description  The sea that washes the foot of the cliffs  where they
most abound  is almost always in a state of the most violent agitation
and affords none of those substances which have been supposed to
constitute the food of the esculent swallow  Another species of
swallow on this island forms a nest  in which grass or moss   c  are
merely agglutinated by a substance  exactly similar to that of which
exclusively the edible nests consist  This substance  from whatever
part of these regions the nests be derived  is essentially uniform
differing only in the colour  according to the relative age of the
nests  It exhibits none of those diversities which might be expected
if it were collected casually  like the mud employed by the martin  and
the materials commonly employed in nest making   and applied to the
rocks  If it consisted of the substances usually supposed  it would be
putrescent and diversified

Dr  Horsfield thinks that it is an animal elaboration  perhaps a kind
of secretion  but to determine its nature accurately  it should be
carefully analyzed  the anatomy of the bird should be investigated  and
its character and habits watched

The kayman of the Dutch  the  boÃ¡ya  of the Malays  and the  bÃ³yo
or  bÃ¡jul  of the Javans  which abounds along the shores and in the
principal rivers of the island  resembles more the crocodile of Egypt
than that of the Ganges  or the American alligator  The character of
the lacerta crocodiles  as given in the Systema NaturÃ¦  applies to
the Javan crocodile  with this difference  that in the latter the two
crests of the tail coalesce towards the extremity  in which respect
it agrees with that of the Ganges  but its head and jaws are broad
and rounded  In its manners  habits  and destructive qualities  it
resembles the largest animals of this genus  Next to the crocodile in
size is the  bÃ©wak  of the Malays  or  menyÃ¡wak  or  selÃ­ra  of the
Javans  It sometimes attains the length of six or seven feet  and lives
near the banks of rivers and marshes  Its character agrees with those
of the lacerta monitor  It is erroneously denominated the guana by
Europeans  The eggs of this animal  as well as of the crocodile  are
eaten by the natives  and the fat is collected for medical purposes  A
small lizard  the  bÃºnglon  of the Javans  is erroneously called the
chameleon  in consequence of the property of changing its colour  It
has the specific characters of the guana  but is much smaller  seldom
exceeding eighteen or twenty inches in length  There are various other
lizards

Two varieties of the turtle   pÃ©nyu  and  pÃ©nyu kombang   are found
in the seas surrounding Java  Both yield the substance called
tortoise shell  but they are seldom taken of sufficient size to render
it valuable  the flesh is excellent  Another kind  of which the species
is unknown  renders a thicker shell   KÃºro  is the name of the common
land tortoise  which is found very abundantly in particular districts

Besides the rana esculenta  green frog   kÃ³dok Ã­jÃ¹  of the Javans
which is frequently eaten  and the  kÃ³dok benju   there is the common
toad   kÃ³dok   and the  bÃ¡nkong  and  kÃ­ntel   The frog fish  rana
paradosa   or a variety of it  is also found on the island  and
has been exhibited in the same supposed metamorphosis as in other
countries  No noxious quality of any of these animals is here known

It is uncertain whether the boa constrictor be found on Java  The
serpent usually called the  Ãºlar sÃ¡wa  is a species of coluber  and has
been described in one of the volumes of the Batavian Transactions  but
several other species are found which arrive at a very large size  One
of them  the  Ãºlar lÃ¡nang   is very much dreaded by the natives  and
said to be poisonous  Of the  Ãºlar sÃ¡wa  there are several varieties
one of which   Ãºlar sÃ¡wa mÃ¡chan   is most beautifully variegated
Upwards of twenty serpents are enumerated as poisonous  The  Ãºlar
lÃ¡mpe  is found at or near the discharge of large rivers into the
ocean  and is more abundant in some districts than in others  This is
greatly dreaded by the natives  its bite however is rarely mortal
and the effects are comparatively slow  death seldom occurring within
twenty four hours from the time of its infliction  No remedies which
deserve notice are known by the natives  charms and superstitious
applications are generally resorted to  The most remarkable serpent
is the  Ãºlar kÃ¡dut   or  kÃ¡rang   The Ãºlar lÃ¡nang  and some of the
varieties  Ãºlar sÃ¡wa  are slender  and possess considerable agility
According to the account of the natives  they frequently ascend trees
and suspending themselves by the extremity of their tail  seize upon
small animals passing below  but the true  Ãºlar sÃ¡wa  of the Eastern
Javans is slow  thick  and unwieldy  Nothing which could illustrate its
supposed power of fascination has been noticed

Of the fish most commonly used for food by the natives  many of which
are excellent and abundant  thirty four species of river fish  seven
found chiefly in pools or stagnant waters  and sixteen sea fish  are
already enumerated by Dr  Horsfield  The classes of amphibia and
pisces  doubtless  afford many new subjects for investigation  Valentyn
enumerates five hundred and twenty eight uncommon kinds of fish found
in the waters of the Eastern Islands

Honey and wax are produced by three species of bees  inhabiting the
largest forests  but they are both collected in very inconsiderable
quantities  Bees are occasionally domesticated by the Arabs and Indians
near the large settlements  but never by the natives  Silk worms were
once introduced by the Dutch near Batavia  but attention to them
did not extend among the natives  The chrysalis of the large atlas
affords a coarse silk  which is however not collected for use  To the
fruit  several insects  and to the corn while in the ear  a peculiar
species  generally known by the name of  wÃ¡lang sÃ¡ngÃ­t   are most
destructive  The latter has in some years destroyed the growth of
whole districts  and occasioned partial scarcity  The natives attempt
in some instances  to extirpate it by burning chaff and brimstone
in the fields  There are scorpions and centipedes  but their bite
is considered of little consequence  the natives generally apply a
cataplasm of onions to the wound  The class of insects affords many
new objects  specimens of most of the genus papilio  and many of other
genera have already been collected

Java does not afford the same opportunities for beautiful collections
of shells as the Moluccas  Papua  and other Islands  Along the northern
coast  few shells are found of beauty or variety  and the corallines
have mostly lost their integrity by attrition  but the extensive bays
in the southern shore contain many of these objects in a state of
beauty and perfection

14  The term  ZapagÃ©  or  Zabaja  seems also to have been a corruption
from  Jawa   and to have been used with the same latitude  according
to the following notices by Major Wilford   There was a constant
intercourse  both by sea and land  between the kingdom of  Magad hi
and China  on the authority of Chinese history  and they traded to an
island and kingdom  called Founan  to the eastward of Siam  during the
third and fourth centuries  This was probably a Malay kingdom  but
we cannot ascertain its situation  It seems that the Malay emperors
and kings  as those of  Zapagi  and  Founan   did what they could to
introduce trade and learning into their dominions  but their exertions
proved ineffectual  at least they were not attended with much success
and their subjects soon relapsed into their former mode of life
There are two countries called Maharaja  which are often confounded
together  the first  at the bottom of the Green Sea  including
Bengal and all the countries on the banks of the Ganges  the second
comprehended the peninsula of Malacca  and some of the adjacent islands
in the seas of China  In these countries the emperor  or king  always
assumed the title of Maharaja  even until this day  Their country
in general  was called  ZapagÃ©  or  Zabaja   which is a corruption
from  Java  or  Jaba   as it was called in the west  and was also the
name of Sumatra  according to Ptolemy  who calls it  Jaba diu   and
to Marco Polo  In the peninsula of Malacca was the famous emporium of
Zaba   Zubaja  in Sanscrit  would signify then  Zaba   The empire of
ZabajÃ©  was thus called  probably  from its metropolis   Zaba   as
well as the principal islands near it   Zaba  was a principal emporium
even as early as the time of Ptolemy  It remained so till the time of
the two Mussulman travellers of Renaudot  and probably much longer
It is now called  Batu Sabor   upon the river Jehor  which is as
large as the Euphrates  according to these travellers  who add  that
the town of Calabar  on the coast of Coromandel  and ten days to the
south of Madras  belonged to the Maharaja of Zabaje  The wars of this
Maharaja with the king of  Alkoner  or countries near Cape Comorin  are
mentioned by the two Mussulman travellers in the ninth century  and
it seems that  at that time  the Malayan empire was in its greatest
splendor     Asiatic Researches   vol  ix

Sanscrit means barley  whence Java has occasionally been termed the
land of barley

17  The breadth is a few miles less between Cheribon and the south
coast  occasioned by the deep bay of  ChelÃ¡chap   and also in the
eastern termination of the island beyond SurabÃ¡ya  where it only
averages forty five geographical miles

18  The term  regencies  is adopted from the title of Regent  given by
the Dutch to the chief native authority in each district

19   SÃºra kÃ©rta  or  Sura kÃ©rta di ning rat   is the name given to the
seat of empire  but as the capital was only removed to its present site
about the middle of the last century  it is still frequently called
Solo   the name of the village in or near which this capital was
established

20  This capital is indifferently turned  Yokya    Jokya    Juju
 Ng yug ya   or  Yug ya kerta   and is the  Djojo Carta   according to
the Dutch orthography  The turn  Yug ya  has been selected  on account
of its nearer approximation to the supposed derivation of the word from
the  Na yud ya  of the Ramayan

21  The height of the mountain  ArjÃºna   in the eastern part of the
island  has been determined at 10 614 feet above the level of the sea
and this mountain is by no means so lofty as those of  SemÃ­ru  and
TegÃ¡l   the exact height of which has not yet been ascertained

22  The height of this mountain has been ascertained to be 5 263
English feet above the level of the sea

23  To the above general observations  which are made on the authority
of Dr  Horsfield  it may not be uninteresting to subjoin a more
particular account of two or three of the volcanos which have been
examined by that gentleman  those of  TÃ¡nkuban Prahu    PapandÃ¡yang
and  GÃºntur  are  therefore  extracted from a paper published by Dr
Horsfield in the Batavian Transactions

  TANKUBAN PRAHU   This mountain  which has derived its name from
 its appearance at a distance  resembling a  prahu   or boat  turned
 upside down  forms a vast truncated cone  Its base extends to a
 very great distance  and it belongs to the largest mountains of
 the island  forming one of its most interesting volcanos  Although
 it has had no violent eruption for many ages  as is evident from
 the progress of vegetation  and from the depth of black mould
 which covers its sides  its interior has continued in a state of
 uninterrupted activity

  The crater is one of the largest  perhaps the largest  of the
 island  It has  in general  the shape of a funnel  but its sides
 are very irregular  The brim  or margin  which bounds it at the
 top  has also different degrees of elevation  rising and descending
 along the whole course of its circumference  The perpendicular
 depth at the side  where I descended  in the south   is at
 least two hundred and fifty feet  in the west the margin rises
 considerably higher  The regular circumference of the crater I
 estimate one English mile and nearly an half  The south side of the
 interior crater  near the top  is very steep  I found it impossible
 to descend  without the assistance of ropes tied to the shrubs at
 the margin  It consists here of small fragments of lava  About
 one third of its depth it becomes more oblique or inclining  and
 the lower part consists of large piles of rocks  through which the
 descending streams of water have excavated a winding channel  The
 east side descends gradually about one half of the depth  where
 it is terminated abruptly by a perpendicular pile of large rocks
 which continues to the bottom  The north side is more gradually
 shelving than the others  and is partly covered with vegetation
 The west side is one perpendicular pile of rocks  The nucleus of
 the mountain consists of large masses of basaltes  in which the
 volcanic opening is situated  and the sides exhibit piles and
 strata of this stone in every possible variety of configuration  In
 some places the rocks have the appearance of a regular wall  which
 is suddenly diversified by large fragments suspended apparently
 by a small base  and threatening to fall down every instant
 Sometimes they rise in an oblique manner  and appear to have been
 disposed by art  But I shall not attempt a minute description of
 the disposition of the rocks and the strata which form the internal
 walls of the crater  which  without an accurate drawing  would be
 tedious and scarcely intelligible  The surface of the rocks which
 line the interior of the crater is completely calcined  generally
 of a white colour  sometimes inclining to grey or yellow  In many
 places small fragments of lava adhere to and cover the rocks of
 basalt  these are of different sizes  and of great variety of form
 and colour  but the most are calcined or burnt  or the surface like
 the rocks themselves  The different sides of the internal crater
 are excavated in many places  by furrows made by the descending
 water  which penetrate to a considerable depth  and expose more
 completely the interior basaltic composition  The bottom of the
 crater has a diameter of three hundred yards  but is not completely
 regular  its form depends on the gradual meeting of the sides
 below  Its surface is much diversified  it is strewed  like the
 sides  with immense blocks of basalt  the interstices between
 which are excavated  in a similar manner  by the streams of the
 descending water

  Near the centre  somewhat inclining to the west side  it contains
 an irregular oval lake  or collection of water  whose greatest
 diameter is nearly one hundred yards  it dilates into several
 branches  The water is white  and exhibits truly the appearance
 of a lake of milk  boiling with a perpetual discharge of large
 bubbles  which rise with greatest force from the eastern side
 The heat is 112  of Fahrenheit s scale  the apparent boiling
 arises from a constant development of fixed air  The water has a
 sulphureous odour  its taste is astringent  somewhat saline  Shaken
 in a bottle it explodes its fixed air with great violence  The
 sides of the lake  to some distance  are lined by a white aluminous
 earth  most impalpably fine  and very loose  on which account it is
 very difficult to approach the water  In attempting to examine its
 temperature  and to collect for analysis  I sunk into the earth to
 a considerable distance  and found it necessary to dispose large
 fragments of basaltes before I was able to pass over it  This
 earth consists of the clay  alumine  of the lavas dissolved by the
 sulphureous steams on the bottom of the crater  it is of the purest
 kind  and divided to a degree minute almost beyond conception
 Large quantities have been several times thrown out of the ancient
 craters of the island  One eruption of this substance occurred
 in the year 1761 from the mountain GedÃ©  it was considered as an
 eruption of ashes

  I was witness to a similar eruption  which occurred from the
 mountain of  Klut   in the month of June last year  The earth very
 much resembled ashes  and was so impalpably fine and light  that
 the common breeze of the monsoon carried it from this mountain
 situated in the longitude of SurabÃ¡ya  to Batavia and farther
 westward  It possessed the properties of the purest clay  and being
 mixed with water became viscid and ductile  It can easily be formed
 into vessels  and if procurable in large quantities  might usefully
 be employed in the arts  All its properties indicated sufficiently
 that it was the alumine of the lavas  divided in an extreme
 degree by the causes above mentioned  The Javanese are not wholly
 unacquainted with the properties of this earth  It is a custom
 amongst silversmiths to collect the ashes thrown out by similar
 eruptions  for the purpose of making  moulds  for the finest works

  Towards the eastern extremity of the lake are the remaining
 outlets of the subterraneous fires  they consist of several
 apertures  from which an uninterrupted discharge of sulphureous
 vapours takes place  Two of these are larger than the rest  they
 are several feet distant from each other  The apertures are of an
 irregular oblong form  and covered with crystals of impure sulphur
 which form from the discharged vapours  and adhere to those
 incrustations of the aluminous earth which have formed themselves
 in a great variety of configurations  hollows  tubes   c   near
 the apertures  The vapours rush out with incredible force  with
 violent subterraneous noises  resembling the boiling of an immense
 cauldron in the bowels of the mountain  their colour is white  like
 the concentrated vapours of boiling water  The apertures cannot be
 approached without the greatest danger  as their true extent cannot
 be discovered  they are surrounded by incrustations of sulphur
 adhering to delicate laminÃ¦ of the aluminous earth  which are
 extremely brittle  The greatest diameter of the large opening is
 nearly twelve inches

  To give an adequate description of the interior of this crater
 would furnish matter for an able pen  the force of the impression
 is increased  perhaps  by the recollection of the danger which
 has been overcome in descending to the bottom  Every thing here
 contributes to fill the mind with the most awful satisfaction  It
 doubtless is one of the most grand and terrific scenes which nature
 affords  and  in the present instance  the extent of the crater  as
 well as the remains of the former explosions  afforded a view and
 enjoyment which is not in my power to describe

  PAPANDAYANG   The PapandÃ¡yang  situated on the western part of the
 district of Cheribon  in the province of  Suka pura   was formerly
 one of the largest volcanos of the island  but the greatest part
 of it was swallowed up in the earth  after a short but very severe
 combustion  in the year 1772  The account which has remained of
 this event asserts  that near midnight  between the 11th and 12th
 of August  there was observed about the mountain an uncommonly
 luminous cloud  by which it appeared to be completely enveloped
 The inhabitants  as well about the foot as on the declivities of
 the mountain  alarmed by this appearance  betook themselves to
 flight  but before they could all save themselves  the mountain
 began to give way  and the greatest part of it actually  fell  in
 and disappeared in the earth  At the same time  a tremendous noise
 was heard  resembling the discharge of the heaviest cannon  Immense
 quantities of volcanic substances  which were thrown out at the
 same time and spread in every direction  propagated the effects of
 the explosion through the space of many miles

  It is estimated  that an extent of ground  of the mountain
 itself and its immediate environs  fifteen miles long and full
 six broad  was by this commotion swallowed up in the bowels of
 the earth  Several persons  sent to examine the condition of the
 neighbourhood  made report  that they found it impossible to
 approach the mountain  on account of the heat of the substances
 which covered its circumference  and which were piled on each
 other to the height of three feet  although this was the 24th
 of September  and thus full six weeks after the catastrophe  It
 is also mentioned  that forty villages  partly swallowed up by
 the ground and partly covered by the substances thrown out  were
 destroyed on this occasion  and that 2 957 of the inhabitants
 perished  A proportionate number of cattle was also destroyed
 and most of the plantations of cotton  indigo  and coffee  in the
 adjacent districts  were buried under the volcanic matter  The
 effects of this explosion are still very apparent on the remains
 of this volcano  but I defer an account of it  till I have had an
 opportunity of making a more minute examination

  GUNTUR   The whole of the eastern part of this mountain is
 completely naked  and exposes to view  in a striking manner  the
 course of the lavas of the latter eruptions  the top is a regular
 cone  and covered with loose fragments of lava  I shall give a
 very concise abstract of the observations on the mountain  and on
 the different streams of lava which have lately flowed from its
 crater  I could distinctly trace  from the base of the conical top
 to the roots of the mountain  five different eruptions  The latest
 stream of lava which I examined  the mountain has since had a later
 eruption  was thrown out in 1800  Its course along the top cannot
 be distinctly observed  being completely covered with sand and
 small fragments of lava  which generally rise towards the end of an
 eruption  At the place where the stream first appeared distinctly
 it was about five yards broad and completely even on the surface
 having proceeded about twenty yards further it gradually widened
 and was formed into a connected stream  higher in the middle  the
 sides tapering or inclining towards the top  forming a ridge with
 a pointed or sharp back  As the stream arrived at the foot of
 the mountain  it spread more and more  and pursued its course to
 the eastward  about six hundred yards over the adjacent country
 Its greatest breadth  from north to south  is about one hundred
 and sixty yards  and it terminates abruptly by a rounded margin
 consisting of large blocks of lava piled upon each other  nearly
 perpendicularly  to the height of fifteen to twenty feet

  This stream of lava  like all the others of later date which I
 have examined on the island  does not consist of a connected mass
 of fluid lava  united like a stream of melted metal  at least on
 the surface where it is exposed to view  It is made up of separate
 masses  which have an irregular  generally oblong or cubical
 shape  and lie upon each other as  loose disjointed clods   in an
 immense variety of disposition  In some of these fragments I think
 I could observe a tendency to assume the regular basaltic figure
 During its course down the steeps of the mountain  the stream
 as has been observed  forms the long connected ridge  which has
 been described above  in the account of the volcanos  as generally
 covering the sides   but having arrived at the foot and spread
 more at large  these lumps of lava dispose themselves  in some
 instances  in plains  bounded by deep vallies  now they rise to
 a considerable height  and form a steep perpendicular eminence
 then again they are piled upon each other more gradually  and
 appear rising by steps and divisions  But to give an accurate
 description of the arrangement of these fragments of lava would be
 unnecessarily prolix  and would require  to be clearly understood
 a good drawing  In different places  the sulphureous vapours have
 forced their way through the interstices of the blocks of lava  The
 sides of their outlets  whose form is very irregular  is covered
 with a white calcareous crust  and the heat is so great  that small
 pieces of paper thrown into them are immediately singed

  This stream of lava is bounded on the north by another  of the
 same nature and disposition  thrown out of the mountain  according
 to an estimate made from the commencement and progress of
 vegetation upon it  about thirty years ago  In its course along
 the sides of the mountain it forms the same pointed ridges above
 described  It affords a plain demonstration of the manner in which
 the surface of lava is decomposed and rendered fit for vegetation
 A third district of lava bounds the new stream first described in
 the south  it is more extensive than the others  and consists of
 several distinct regions  probably thrown out during one eruption
  which appears to have been more violent than the others   but in
 successive periods shortly following each other  It extends farther
 to the eastward than the others  and covers a great portion of the
 foot of the mountain  Vegetation has already made considerable
 progress upon it  in the vallies between the separate streams of
 lava are found not only plants but also small shrubs  At one place
 near the termination of this stream  the lava is piled up in two
 irregular ridges to the height of twenty feet  and at a small
 distance from its eastern extremity  in a spot which has escaped
 the effects of the later eruptions  and is covered by pleasant
 wood  are three different hot wells  within the circumference of a
 quarter of a mile  In the south  this district of lava is bounded
 by a recent stream  which appears to have been thrown out in 1800
 by the same eruption which produced the first mentioned stream  It
 differs from the others only in the colour of its lava  which has
 a reddish hue  it is less considerable in extent than any of the
 others  and cannot be traced far from the foot of the mountain  The
 fifth stream of lava which I examined is still farther towards the
 south  and is one of the oldest which have been discharged from
 the eastern part of the crater  Near the foot of the mountain
 vegetation has made greater progress than in any of the other
 districts of lava

  The colour of the recent lava of this mountain is jet black or
 grey  one of the streams only has a reddish colour  Its texture is
 very loose  and its fracture very porous  The smaller fragments
 have much the appearance of the scoriÃ¦ of a blacksmith s forge  on
 being thrown against each other  they emit a sound like two bricks
 coming into contact  The interior crater of this mountain  as it
 has remained after the eruption of 1800  is less interesting than
 the others which I have examined  Its shape is somewhat oval  the
 greatest diameter being about one hundred yards  its depth is not
 very considerable  Its structure  in general  is similar to that of
  Tankuban prahu   It has one remaining aperture  which discharges
 with great force hot sulphureous vapours

24  Mineral wells  of various qualities  are found in almost
every part of the island  As an instance of the hot wells  the
following account of those found in Cheribon is selected   At the
village of  Bongas   situated about ten miles to the north east of
Karang Sambong   I directed my route to the large mountain  in
order to examine part of the hills along its foot  called the hills
of  Pana wangan   and several hot wells which are found near their
borders  On approaching these hills  after a very gentle acclivity
covered entirely by calcareous stones  I very soon came to the spot
of the hot wells  They are found on a gently inclining plain  about
one hundred yards in circumference  This plain is perfectly white  and
on approaching it  it is perceived at some distance by a sulphureous
vapour  arising from the whole neighbourhood  The water springs from
several apertures  but their temperatures are not equal  the hottest
indicates the degree of one hundred and thirty of Fahrenheit s scale
They all contain a very large quantity of calcareous earth in solution
and suspension  which coming into contact with the air  immediately
separates  and adheres to the surrounding objects  or is precipitated
to the ground  The branches of the shrubs in the vicinity are all
enveloped by a stalactical incrustation  The water from the different
wells gently descending the white calcareous plain  is collected in
a rivulet below  A large number of calcareous rocks are found in
the vicinity of the plains  some are covered with elegant crystals
of calcareous spar  others have a coralline appearance  and some
have the fracture of alabaster  On proceeding up the hills  immense
irregular blocks of calcareous rocks are found strewed about in the
valleys  About one hundred yards above this district are several wells
of naphtha  or petroleum  It rises in small plashes of water  about
twelve or eighteen inches in diameter  upon which it drives its black
specks  emitting the peculiar odour of the petroleum  The earth in the
circumference of these plashes is strongly impregnated with this oil
it is very tough  and from that immediately bounding apertures  the
naphtha flows out on its being pressed  some portions exactly resemble
asphaltum  A considerable space of ground is occupied by these wells
The stones are all calcareous  A few hundred yards above this spot  the
borders of the hills become very steep  I examined them to some extent
They are composed exclusively of calcareous stones  Several extensive
stalactitic caves are found at no great distance above the wells
they exhibit the usual appearances of calcareous caves and vaults
The process of incrustation is continually going on  In some places
deep perforations extend into the heart of the hills     Essay on the
Mineralogy of Java  by Dr  Horsfield  Bat  Trans   vol  ix

Among other objects of curiosity  which can only be illustrated by
particular description  are the explosions of mud  situated between
the district of Grobogan on the west  and of Blora and Jipang on the
east  By the natives they are termed BlÃ©deg  and are described by Dr
Horsfield as salt wells

These salt wells   he observes   are dispersed through a district of
country several miles in circumference  the base of which  like that
of other parts of the island which furnish mineral and other saline
waters  is limestone  They are of considerable number  and force
themselves upwards  through apertures in the rocks  with some violence
and ebullition  The waters are strongly impregnated with sea salt
and yield upon evaporation very good salt for culinary purposes   In
quantity not less than two hundred tons in the year

About the centre of this limestone district  is found an extraordinary
volcanic phenomenon  On approaching it from a distance  it is first
discovered by a large volume of smoke rising and disappearing at
intervals of a few seconds  resembling the vapours arising from a
violent surf  a dull noise is heard  like that of distant thunder
Having advanced so near  that the vision was no longer impeded by the
smoke  a large hemispherical mass was observed  consisting of black
earth  mixed with water  about sixteen feet in diameter  rising to
the height of twenty or thirty feet in a perfectly regular manner
and as it were pushed up  by a force beneath  which suddenly exploded
with a dull noise  and scattered about a volume of black mud in every
direction  After an interval of two or three  or sometimes four or
five seconds  the hemispherical body of mud or earth rose and exploded
again  In the same manner this volcanic ebullition goes on without
interruption  throwing up a globular body of mud  and dispersing it
with violence through the neighbouring plain  The spot where the
ebullition occurs is nearly circular and perfectly level  it is
covered only with the earthy particles impregnated with salt water
which are thrown up from below  the circumference may be estimated at
about half an English mile  In order to conduct the salt water to the
circumference  small passages  or gutters  are made in the loose muddy
earth  which lead it to the borders  where it is collected in holes dug
in the ground for the purpose of evaporation

A strong  pungent  sulphureous smell  somewhat resembling that of
earth oil  is perceived on standing near the explosion  and the mud
recently thrown up possesses a degree of heat greater than that of the
surrounding atmosphere  During the rainy season these explosions are
more violent  the mud is thrown up much higher  and the noise is heard
at a greater distance

This volcanic phenomenon is situated near the centre of the large
plain which interrupts the large series of volcanos  and owes its
origin to the general cause of the numerous volcanic eruptions which
occur on the island    Batavian Trans   vol  ix

These salt wells  as Dr  Horsfield terms them  and other phenomena
connected with them  appear to be precisely of the same description as
the mud volcano at Macalouba  in Sicily  and the eruptions described by
Pallas  at Tainan and Kercha  the boundary of Europe to the south east
of Little Tartary  and no doubt owe their origin to similar causes  the
extrication of gas  as well described by Dallas  in his Translation
of the History of Volcanos  by the AbbÃ© Ordinaire   page 249  All the
phenomenon described in this work  as well in Sicily as at Tainan and
Kercha  are to be found in Java  where  on the hypothesis of the AbbÃ©
the vitriolic acid liberating a great quantity of fixed air from the
salts with which this argillaceous and limy mass is impregnated  is
observed escaping copiously  by a general bubbling on the surface of
the plain  when the substances are sufficiently diluted by rain    c

On the hypothesis of the AbbÃ© it may  therefore  be doubted whether
the assertion  that the BlÃ©degs owe their origin to the general cause
of the numerous volcanos on the island  is correct   Pallas conceives
that the phenomenon at Kercha and Tainan may be explained by supposing
a deep coal mine to have been for ages on fire  that the sea broke in
upon it  that the water was turned into steam  and that the expansion
occasioned thereby  and the struggle of the different gases to get
free  force the upper surface   c  but there seems no necessity for
admitting the action of fire  the mud he describes is only  luke warm
this is precisely the case in Java

It is remarkable that in Java  as in Sicily  in the vicinity of these
phenomena   the country around is of calcareous earth  briny springs
and salt mines are found in the neighbourhood  some beds of oil of
petroleum are also observed floating on adjacent stagnant waters

25  The tradition is as follows    It is related  that in former
times the islands of Sumatra  Java  Bali  and Sumbawa were united  and
afterwards separated into nine different parts  and it is also said
that when three thousand rainy seasons have passed away  they will be
reunited

 The separation of the lands of Palembang  Sumatra  and Java
 took place in the Javan year                                      1114

 The separation of the lands of Bali and Balembangan on Java in    1204

 The separation of the lands of Giling TrawangÃ¡n and Bali in       1260

 The separation of the island of Selo Parang and Sumbawa in        1280

26  In order to give the reader some idea of the tremendous violence
with which nature sometimes distinguishes the operations of the
volcano in these regions  and enable him to form some conjecture
from the occurrences of recent experience  of the effects they may
have produced in past ages  a short account of the extraordinary and
wide spread phenomena that accompanied the eruption of the Tomboro
mountain  in the island of Sumbawa  in April 1815  may not be
uninteresting  Almost every one is acquainted with the intermitting
convulsions of Etna and Vesuvius  as they appear in the descriptions
of the poet and the authentic accounts of the naturalist  but the most
extraordinary of them can bear no comparison  in point of duration
and force  with that of Tomboro  This eruption extended perceptible
evidences of its existence over the whole of the Molucca islands
over Java  a considerable portion of Celebes  Sumatra  and Borneo
to a circumference of a thousand statute miles from its centre  by
tremulous motions  and the report of explosions  while within the range
of its more immediate activity  embracing a space of three hundred
miles around it  it produced the most astonishing effects  and excited
the most alarming apprehensions  On Java  at the distance of three
hundred miles  it seemed to be awfully present  The sky was overcast at
noon day with clouds of ashes  the sun was enveloped in an atmosphere
whose  palpable  density he was unable to penetrate  showers of ashes
covered the houses  the streets  and the fields to the depth of several
inches  and amid this darkness explosions were heard at intervals  like
the report of artillery or the noise of distant thunder  So fully did
the resemblance of the noises to the report of cannon impress the minds
of some officers  that from an apprehension of pirates on the coast
vessels were dispatched to afford relief  Superstition  on the other
hand  on the minds of the natives  was busily at work  and attributed
the reports to an artillery of a different description to that of
pirates  All conceived that the effects experienced might be caused by
eruptions of some of the numerous volcanos on the island  but no one
could have conjectured that the showers of ashes which darkened the
air  and covered the ground of the eastern districts of Java  could
have proceeded from a mountain in Sumbawa  at the distance of several
hundred miles  Conceiving that it might be interesting and curious to
preserve an authentic and detailed account of the information that
could be gained of this wonderful phenomenon  while the event was still
recent and fully remembered  I directed a circular to the different
Residents  requiring them to transmit to the Government a statement of
the facts and circumstances connected with it  which occurred within
their own knowledge  From their replies  the narrative drawn up by Mr
Assey  and printed in the ninth volume of the Batavian Transactions
was collected  the following is an extract from that paper

The first explosions were heard on this island  Java  in the evening
of the 5th of April  they were noticed in every quarter  and continued
at intervals until the following day  The noise was  in the first
instance  universally attributed to distant cannon  so much so
that a detachment of troops was marched from Djocjocarta  under the
apprehension that a neighbouring post had been attacked  and along
the coast boats were in two instances dispatched in quest of supposed
ships in distress  On the following morning  however  a slight fall
of ashes removed all doubt as to the cause of the sound  and it is
worthy of remark  that as the eruption continued  the sound appeared
to be so close  that in each district it seemed near at hand  and was
generally attributed to an eruption either from the mountains Merapi
Klut  or Bromo  From the 6th the sun became obscured  it had every
where the appearance of being enveloped in a fog  The weather was
sultry and the atmosphere close  and still the sun seemed shorn of its
rays  and the general stillness and pressure of the atmosphere seemed
to forebode an earthquake  This lasted several days  The explosions
continued occasionally  but less violently  and less frequently than
at first  Volcanic ashes also began to fall  but in small quantities
and so slightly as to be hardly perceptible in the western district
This appearance of the atmosphere continued  with little variation
until the 10th of April  and till then it does not appear that the
volcano attracted much observation  or was considered of greater
importance than those which have occasionally burst forth in Java  But
on the evening of the 10th  the eruptions were heard more loud and
more frequent  from Cheribon eastward the air became darkened by the
quantity of falling ashes  the sun was nearly darkened  and in some
situations  particularly at Solo and Rembang  many said that they felt
a tremulous motion of the earth  It was universally remarked in the
more eastern districts  that the explosions were tremendous  continuing
frequently during the 11th  and of such violence as to shake the houses
perceptibly  An unusual thick darkness was remarked all the following
night  and the greater part of the next day  At Solo candles were
lighted at 4 p  m  of the 12th  at MÃ¡gelan in KÃ©du  objects could not
be seen at three hundred yards distance  At GrÃ©sik  and other districts
more eastward  it was dark as night in the greater part of the 12th
April  and this saturated state of the atmosphere lessened as the cloud
of ashes passed along and discharged itself on its way  Thus the ashes
that were eight inches deep at BÃ¡nyuwÃ¡ngi were but two in depth at
SÃºmenap  and less in GrÃ©sik  and the sun does not seem to have been
actually obscured in any district west of SemÃ¡rang

All reports concur in stating  that so violent and extensive an
eruption has not happened within the memory of the oldest inhabitant
nor within tradition  They speak of similar effects  in a lesser
degree  when an eruption took place from the volcano of Karang Asam in
Bali  about seven years ago  and it was at first supposed that this
mountain was the seat of the eruption  The Balinese on Java attributed
the event to a recent dispute between the two Rajahs of Bali Baliling
which terminated in the death of the younger Rajah by order of his
brother

The haziness and heat of the atmosphere  and occasional fall of
volcanic ashes  continued until the 14th  and in some parts of the
island until the 17th of April  They were cleared away universally
by a heavy fall of rain  after which the atmosphere became clear and
more cool  and it would seem that this seasonable relief prevented
much injury to the crops  and removed an appearance of epidemic
disease which was beginning to prevail  This was especially the case
at Batavia  where  for two or three days preceding the rain  many
persons were attacked with fever  As it was  however  no material
injury was felt beyond the districts of BanyuwÃ¡ngi  The cultivators
every where took precaution to shake off the ashes from the growing
paddy as they fell  and the timely rain removed an apprehension very
generally entertained  that insects would have been generated by the
long continuance of the ashes at the root of the plant  In Rembang
where the rain did not fall till the 17th  and the ashes had been
considerable  the crops were somewhat injured  but in BanyuwÃ¡ngi
the part of the island on which the cloud of ashes spent its force
the injury was more extensive  A large quantity of paddy was totally
destroyed  and all the plantations more or less injured  One hundred
and twenty six horses and eighty six head of cattle also perished
chiefly for want of forage  during a month from the time of the
eruption

From Sumbawa to the part of Sumatra where the sound was noticed  is
about nine hundred and seventy geographical miles in a direct line
From Sumbawa to Ternate is a distance of about seven hundred and twenty
miles  The distance also to which the cloud of ashes was carried  so
quickly as to produce utter darkness  was clearly pointed out to have
been the island of Celebes and the districts of GrÃ©sik on Java  the
former is two hundred and seventeen nautical miles distant from the
seat of the volcano  the latter  in a direct line  more than three
hundred geographical miles

The following is an extract from the reports of Lieutenant Owen
Phillips  dated at Bima on the island of Sumbawa   On my trip towards
the western part of the island  I passed through nearly the whole of
Dompo and a considerable part of Bima  The extreme misery to which the
inhabitants have been reduced is shocking to behold  There were still
on the road side the remains of several corpses  and the marks of where
many others had been interred  the villages almost entirely deserted
and the houses fallen down  the surviving inhabitants having dispersed
in search of food  The Rajah of Sang ir came to wait on me at Dompo
on the 3d instant  The suffering of the people there appears  from his
account  to be still greater than in Dompo  The famine has been so
severe that even one of his own daughters died from hunger  I presented
him with three coyangs of rice in your name  for which he appeared most
truly thankful

As the Rajah was himself a spectator of the late eruption  the
following account which he gave me is perhaps more to be depended
upon than any other I can possibly obtain  About 7 p  m  on the 10th
of April  three distinct columns of flame burst forth near the top of
the Tomboro mountain  all of them apparently within the verge of the
crater   and after ascending separately to a very great height  their
tops united in the air in a troubled confused manner  In a short time
the whole mountain next Sang ir appeared like a body of liquid fire
extending itself in every direction  The fire and columns of flame
continued to rage with unabated fury  until the darkness caused by the
quantity of falling matter obscured it at about 8 p  m  Stones  at
this time  fell very thick at Sang ir  some of them as large as two
fists  but generally not larger than walnuts  Between 9 and 10 p  m
ashes began to fall  and soon after a violent whirlwind ensued  which
blew down nearly every house in the village of Sang ir  carrying the
ataps  or roofs  and light parts away with it  In the part of Sang ir
adjoining Tomboro its effects were much more violent  tearing up by the
roots the largest trees and carrying them into the air  together with
men  horses  cattle  and whatever else came within its influence   This
will account for the immense number of floating trees seen at sea
The sea rose nearly twelve feet higher than it had ever been known to
do before  and completely spoiled the only small spots of rice land
in Sang ir  sweeping away houses and every thing within its reach
The whirlwind lasted about an hour  No explosions were heard till the
whirlwind had ceased  at about 11 a  m  From midnight till the evening
of the 11th  they continued without intermission  after that time their
violence moderated  and they were only heard at intervals  but the
explosions did not cease entirely until the 15th of July  Of the whole
villages of Tomboro  Tempo containing about forty inhabitants is the
only one remaining  In PekÃ¡tÃ© no vestige of a house is left  twenty six
of the people  who were at Sumbawa at the time  are the whole of the
population who have escaped  From the most particular inquiries I have
been able to make  there were certainly not fewer than twelve thousand
individuals in Tomboro and PekÃ¡tÃ© at the time of the eruption  of whom
only five or six survive  The trees and herbage of every description
along the whole of the north and west sides of the peninsula  have been
completely destroyed  with the exception of a high point of land near
the spot where the village of Tomboro stood

30  It is remarkable that the teak tree  which  as far as our
information yet extends  is not to be found on the peninsula of
Malacca  or on Sumatra or the adjacent islands  should grow in
abundance on Java and several of the islands which lie east of it
as on MadÃºra and its dependent islands  BÃ¡li  SumbÃ¡wa  and others
SumbÃ¡wa produces a considerable quantity  The whole of the hills on the
north east part of that island under BÃ­ma are covered with it  but from
the constant demand for the timber  the trees are seldom allowed to
grow to more than a foot in diameter  except in the forests exclusively
appropriated to the use of the sovereign  In DÃ³mpo  which occupies the
central division of the same island  the teak cannot be used by any
but the sovereign  and the trees are in consequence allowed to attain
their full size  The timber is here uncommonly fine  and by the natives
considered superior to that of Java  but the forests being surrounded
by steep hills  and the population but scanty  it cannot be transported
to the sea coast without great labour and expense  On Celebes the
teak tree is only known in a few spots  The principal forest is in
the district of Mario  and this does not appear to be indigenous  as
the natives assert that the seed from which the forest has grown  was
brought from Java about eighty years ago by one of the sovereigns of
TanÃ©tÃ©

31  The Dutch  apprehensive of a failure in the usual supply of teak
timber  have long been in the habit of forming extensive plantations of
this tree  but whether from a sufficient period not having yet elapsed
for the trial  or that the plantations are generally made in soils and
situations ill calculated for the purpose  experience  as far as it has
yet gone  has shown  that the trees which are left to the operations of
nature  attain to greater perfection  even in a comparatively barren
soil  unfit for any other cultivation  than those which are with great
care and trouble reared in a fertile land  Their wood is more firm
more durable  and of a less chalky substance than that of the latter

33  Although a serious refutation of the gross imposition practised on
the people of Europe  by the romance of Foersch on the subject of the
upas  or celebrated poison tree of Java  may at this day be in a great
measure superfluous  as the world has long ceased to be the dupe of
his story  and as regular series of experiments have been instituted
both in France and in England  to ascertain the nature and potency of
the poison  yet it may not be altogether displeasing to the reader to
see in this place an authentic account of the poison  as drawn out by
Dr  Horsfield at my request  and published in the seventh volume of
the Batavian Transactions  Almost every one has heard of its fabulous
history  which  from its extravagant nature  its susceptibility of
poetical ornament  its alliance with the cruelties of a despotic
government  and the sparkling genius of Darwin  whose purpose it
answered to adopt and personify it as a malignant spirit  in his Lives
of the Plants   has obtained almost equal currency with the wonders of
the Lerna Hydra  the Chimera  or any other of the classic fictions of
antiquity

Although the account published by Foersch  in so far as relates to
the situation of the poison tree  to its effects on the surrounding
country  and to the application said to have been made of the upas on
criminals in different parts of the island  as well as the description
of the poisonous substance itself  and its mode of collection  has been
demonstrated to be an extravagant forgery   the existence of a tree on
Java  from the sap of which a poison is prepared  equal in fatality
when thrown into the circulation  to the strongest animal poisons
hitherto known  is a fact which is at present my object to establish
and illustrate  The tree which produces this poison is the anchar  and
grows in the eastern extremity of the island  The work of Rhumphius
contains a long account of the upas  under the denomination of arbor
toxicaria  The tree does not grow on Amboyna  and his description was
made from the information he obtained from Makasar  His figure was
drawn from a branch of what is called the male tree  sent to him from
the same place  and establishes the identity of the poison tree of
Makasar  and the other Eastern Islands  with the anchar of Java  The
simple sap of the arbor toxicaria  according to Rhumphius  is harmless
and requires the addition of several substances  of the affinity of
ginger  to render it active and mortal  In so far it agrees with the
anchar  which  in its simple state  is  supposed  to be inert  and
before being employed as a poison  is subjected to a preparation which
will be described after the history of the tree  Besides the true
poison tree  the upas of the Eastern Islands  and the anchar of the
Javans  this island produces a shrub  which  as far as observations
have hitherto been made  is peculiar to the same  and  by a different
mode of preparation  furnishes a poison far exceeding the upas in
violence  Its name is chetik  and its specific description will succeed
to that of the anchar  the genus has not yet been discovered or
described

DESCRIPTION OF THE ANCHAR   The anchar belongs to the twenty first
class of LinnÃ¦us  the monoecia  The male and female flowers are
produced in catkins  amenta  on the same branch  at no great distance
from each other  the female flowers are in general above the male  The
characters of the genus are   MALE flower  calix  consisting of several
scales  which are imbricate  Corol  none  Stamens  filaments many  very
short  covered with scales at the receptacle  The receptacle  on which
the filaments are placed  has a conical form  abrupt  somewhat rounded
above   FEMALE flower  catkins  ovate  Calix  consisting of a number
of scales  generally more than in the male   containing one flower
Corol  none  Pistil  germ single  ovate  Styles  two  long  slender
and spreading  Stigmas  single and acute  Seed vessel  an oblong drupe
covered with the calix  Seed  an ovate nut  with one cell

SPECIFIC DESCRIPTION   The anchar is one of the largest trees in the
forests of Java  The stem is cylindrical  perpendicular  and rises
completely naked to the height of sixty  seventy  or eighty feet
Near the surface of the ground it spreads obliquely  dividing into
numerous broad appendages or wings  much like the canarium commune
the canary tree   and several other of our large forest trees  It is
covered with a whitish bark  slightly bursting in longitudinal furrows
Near the ground this bark is  in old trees  more than half an inch
thick  and upon being wounded yields plentifully the milky juice from
which the celebrated poison is prepared  A puncture or incision being
made into the tree  the juice or sap appears oozing out of a yellowish
colour  somewhat frothy  from old  paler or nearly white from young
trees  exposed to the air  its surface becomes brown  The consistence
very much resembles milk  it is more thick and viscid  This sap is
contained in the true bark  or cortex   which  when punctured  yields
a considerable quantity  so that in a short time a cup full may be
collected from a large tree  The inner bark  or liber  is of a close
fibrous texture  like that of the morus papyrifera  and when separated
from the other bark  and cleansed from the adhering particles
resembles a coarse piece of linen  It has been worked into ropes  which
are very strong  and the poorer class of people employ the inner bark
of the younger trees  which is more easily prepared  for the purpose
of making a coarse stuff which they wear in working in the fields  But
it requires much bruising  washing  and a long immersion  before it
can be used  and when it appears completely purified  persons wearing
this dress being exposed to rain  are affected with an intolerable
itching  which renders their flimsy covering insupportable  It will
appear from the account of the manner in which the poison is prepared
that the deleterious quality exists in the gum  a small portion of
which still adhering  produces  when exposed to wet  this irritating
effect  and it is singular  that this property of the prepared bark
is known to the Javans in all places where the tree grows  while the
preparation of a poison from its juice  which produces a mortal effect
when introduced into the body by pointed weapons  is an exclusive art
of the inhabitants of the eastern extremity of the island  The stem
of the anchar having arrived at the above mentioned height  sends
off a few stout branches  which spreading nearly horizontally with
several irregular curves  divide into smaller branches  and form a
hemispherical  not very regular  crown  Previous to the season of
flowering  about the beginning of June  the tree sheds its leaves
which reappear when the male flowers have completed the office of
fecundation  It delights in a fertile  not very elevated  soil  and is
only found in the largest forests  One of the experiments to be related
below was made with the upas prepared by myself  In the collection of
the juice I had some difficulty in inducing the inhabitants to assist
me  they feared a cutaneous eruption and inflammation  resembling
according to the account they gave of it  that produced by the ingas
of this island  the rhus vernix of Japan  and the rhus radicans of
North America  The anchar  like the trees in its neighbourhood  is
on all sides surrounded by shrubs and plants  in no instance have I
observed the ground naked or barren in its immediate circumference  The
largest tree I met with in Balambangan  was so closely environed by the
common trees and shrubs of the forest in which it grew  that it was
with difficulty I could approach it  Several vines and climbing shrubs
in complete health and vigour  adhered to it  and ascended to nearly
half its height  and  at the time I visited the tree and collected the
juice  I was forcibly struck with the egregious misrepresentation of
Foersch  Several young trees spontaneously sprung from seeds that had
fallen from the parent  put me in mind of a line in Darwin s Botanic
Garden

             Chain d at his root two scion demons dwell

while in recalling his beautiful description of the upas  my vicinity
to the tree gave me reason to rejoice that it was founded in fiction

DESCRIPTION OF THE CHETIK   The fructification of the chetik is still
unknown  after all possible research in the district where it grows
I have not been able to find it in a flowering state  It is a large
winding shrub  The root extends creeping a considerable distance
parallel to the surface  sending off small fibres at different curves
while the main root strikes perpendicularly into the ground  The stem
which in general is shrubby  sometimes acquires the size of a small
tree  The poison is prepared from the bark of the root  The chetik
grows only in close  shady  almost inaccessible forests  in a deep
black  fertile vegetable mould  It is very rarely met with even in the
wildernesses of Balambangan

PREPARATION OF THE POISON FROM THE ANCHAR   This process was performed
for me by an old Javan  who was celebrated for his superior skill in
preparing the poison  about eight ounces of the juice of the anchar
which had been collected the preceding evening in the usual manner  and
been preserved in the joint of a bambu  was carefully strained into
a bowl  The sap of the following substances  which had been finely
grated and bruised  was carefully expressed and poured into it  viz
arum  nampu   kempferia galanga  kenchur   anomum  bengli  a variety
of zerumbed  common onion and garlic  of each about half a drachm  The
same quantity of finely powdered black pepper was then added  and the
mixture stirred  The preparer now took an entire fruit of capsicum
fruticosum or Guinea pepper  and having opened it  he carefully
separated a single seed  and placed it on the fluid in the middle of
the bowl  It immediately began to reel round rapidly  now forming a
regular circle  then darting towards the margin of the vessel  with a
perceptible commotion on the surface of the liquor  which continued
about one minute  Being completely at rest  the same quantity of pepper
was again added  and another seed of the capsicum laid on as before
A similar commotion took place in the fluid  but in a less degree
and the seed was carried round with diminished rapidity  The addition
of the same quantity of pepper was repeated a third time  when a seed
of the capsicum being carefully placed in the centre of the fluid
remained quiet  forming a regular circle about itself in the fluid
resembling the halo of the moon  This is considered as a sign that the
preparation of the poison is complete

PREPARATION OF THE POISON FROM THE CHETIK   The bark of the root
is carefully separated and cleared of all the adherent earth  a
proportionate quantity of water is poured on  and it is boiled about
an hour  when the fluid is carefully filtered through a white cloth
it is then exposed to the fire again  and boiled down to nearly the
consistence of an extract  in this state it much resembles a thick
syrup  The following spices  having been prepared as above described
are added in the same proportion as to the anchar  viz  kempferia
galanga  kenchur    sÃºnti   anomum zingÃ©ber  shai   common onion
garlic  and black pepper  The expressed juice of these is poured into
the vessel  which is once more exposed to the fire for a few minutes
when the preparation is complete  The upas of both kinds must be
preserved in very close vessels

Dr  H  then details the particulars of twenty experiments made on
different animals with these poisons  as well in their simple state
as procured from the bark  powerfully prepared in the manner as above
stated  in which the violence of the poison was manifested  and
concludes with some general observations  from which the following are
extracted

The operation of the two different poisons on the animal system is
essentially different  The first seventeen experiments were made with
the anchar  The rapidity of its effect depends in a great degree
upon the size of the vessel wounded  and on the quantity of poison
carried into the circulation  In the first experiment  it induced
death in twenty six minutes  in the second  which was made with the
sap collected at PÃºgar  in thirteen minutes  The poison from different
parts of the island has been found nearly equal in activity  The common
train of symptoms is  a trembling and shivering of the extremities
restlessness  erection of the hair  discharges from the bowels
drooping and faintness  slight spasms and convulsions  hasty breathing
an increased flow of saliva  spasmodic contractions of the pectoral and
abdominal muscles  retching  vomiting  excrementitious vomiting  frothy
vomiting  great agony  laborious breathing  repeated convulsions  and
death  The effects are nearly the same on quadrupeds  in whatever part
of the body the wound is made  It sometimes acts with so much force
that not all the symptoms enumerated are observed  In these cases
after the premonitory symptoms  tremors  twitchings  faintness  an
increased flow of saliva   the convulsions come on suddenly  and are
quickly followed by death  The upas appears to affect quadrupeds with
nearly equal force  proportionate in some degree to their size and
disposition  To dogs it proved mortal in most experiments within an
hour  a mouse died in ten minutes  a monkey in seven  a cat in fifteen
a buffalo  one of the largest quadrupeds of the island  died in two
hours and ten minutes

If the simple or unprepared sap is mixed with the extract of tobacco
instead of the spices mentioned  it is rendered equally  perhaps more
active  Even the pure juice  unmixed and unprepared  appears to act
with a force equal to that which has undergone the preparative process
Birds are very differently affected by this poison  Fowls have a
peculiar capacity to resist its effects  a fowl died in twenty four
hours after the wound  others have recovered after being partially
affected

The eighteenth and succeeding experiments were made with the poison
prepared from the chetik  Its operation is far more violent and
rapid than that of the anchar  and it affects the animal system in a
different manner  While the anchar operates chiefly on the stomach
alimentary canal  the respiration and circulation  the chetik is
determined to the brain and nervous system  a relative comparison
of the appearances on dissection  demonstrates in a striking manner
the peculiar operation of each  A general view of the effects of the
chetik on quadrupeds is given in these experiments  After the previous
symptoms of faintness  drowsiness  and slight convulsions  it acts by
a sudden impulse  which like a violent apoplexy prostrates at once the
whole nervous system  In two of these experiments this sudden effect
took place in the sixth minute after the wound  in another in the
seventh minute  the animals suddenly started  fell down head foremost
and continued in convulsions until death ensued  This poison affects
fowls in a much more violent manner than that of the anchar  They are
first affected by a heat and itching of the breast and wings  which
they shew by violently pecking those parts  this is followed by a
loose discharge from the bowels  when they are seized with tremors
and fluttering of the wings  which having continued a short time
they fall down head foremost  and continue convulsed till death  In
some instances  particularly young fowls  the poison acts with great
rapidity  death has frequently occurred within the space of a minute
after a puncture with a poisoned dart

Taken into the stomach of quadrupeds  the chetik acts as a most
violent poison  but it requires about thrice the period to produce
the same effect which a wound produces  But the stomach of fowls can
resist its operation  Having mixed about double the quantity generally
adhering to a dart with the food of a fowl  it consumed it without
shewing any marks of indisposition  The poison of the anchar does by
no means act as violently on quadrupeds as that of the chetik  I have
given it to a dog  it produced at first nearly the same symptoms as
a puncture  oppression of the head  twitchings  faintness  laborious
respiration  violent contraction of the pectoral and abdominal muscles
c  which continued nearly two hours  but after the complete evacuation
of the stomach by vomiting  the animal gradually recovered

I have but little to add concerning the operation of the anchar
on the human system  The only credible information on this subject
is contained in the work of Rhumphius  who had an opportunity of
personally observing the effect of the poisoned darts and arrows as
they were used by the natives of Makasar  in their attack on Amboyna
about the year 1650  They were also employed by the inhabitants
of Celebes in their former wars with the Dutch  Speaking of their
operation he says   the poison touching the warm blood  it is instantly
carried through the whole body  so that it may be felt in all the
veins  and causes an excessive burning  particularly in the head
which is followed by fainting and death   This poison  according to
the same author  possesses different degrees of virulence  according
to its age and state of preservation  The most powerful is called upas
raja  and its effects are considered as incurable  the other kinds are
distributed among the soldiers on going to war  After having proved
mortal to many of the Dutch soldiers in Amboyna and Makasar  they
finally discovered an almost infallible remedy in the root of the radix
toxicaria of Rhumphius  which  if timely applied  counteracted  by its

The inhabitants of Java seem to owe their origin to the same stock
from which most of the islands lying to the south of the eastern
Peninsula of Asia appear to have been first peopled  This stock is
evidently Tartar  and has  by its numerous and wide spreading branches
not only extended itself over the Indian Archipelago  but over the
neighbouring Continent   To judge from external appearance  that is to
say  from shape  size  and feature   observes Dr  Francis Buchanan
in his Notices on the Birman Empire 34    there is one very extensive
nation that inhabits the east of Asia  It includes the eastern and
western Tartars of the Chinese authors  the Calmucs  the Chinese  the
Japanese  and other tribes inhabiting what is called the Peninsula
of India beyond the Ganges  and the islands to the south and east
of this  as far at least as New Guinea     This nation   adds the
same author   may be distinguished by a short  squat  robust  fleshy
stature  and by features highly different from those of an European
The face is somewhat in shape of a lozenge  the forehead and chin being
sharpened  whilst at the cheek bones it is very broad  The eyebrows  or
superciliary ridges  in this nation  project very little  and the eyes
are very narrow  and placed rather obliquely in the head  the external
angles being the highest  The nose is very small  but has not  like
that of the negro  the appearance of being flattened  and the apertures
of the nostrils  which in the European are linear and parallel
in them are nearly circular and divergent  for the  septum narium
being much thickest towards the face  places them entirely out of the
parallel line  The mouths of this nation are in general well shaped
their hair is harsh  lank  and black  Those of them that live even in
the highest climates do not obtain the deep hue of the negro or Hindu
nor do such of them as live in the coldest climates acquire the clear
bloom of the European

But although the Javans are to be included under this general
description  it does not follow that they bear an exact  or very
striking resemblance  in person and feature  to the Chinese or
Japanese  nor even that they are liable to be confounded with the
Birmans or Siamese  From the former  indeed  they are far removed by
many obvious characteristics  and though more nearly resembling the
latter  they possess many peculiarities  which mark them out to the
most careless observer as a race distinct and separate for ages  though
still retaining general traces of a common origin  As we approach the
limits of savage life  and recur to that inartificial  unimproved state
of society  in which the primitive divergence may be supposed to have
taken place  we shall find the points of resemblance increased  and the
proofs of a common descent multiplied  The less civilized of the tribes
inhabiting the islands  approach so nearly  in physical appearance  to
that portion of the inhabitants of the Peninsula  which has felt least
of the Chinese influence on the one side  and of the Birman and Siamese
on the other  and exhibit so striking an affinity in their usages and
customs  as to warrant the hypothesis that the tide of population
originally flowed towards the islands  from that quarter of the
Continent lying between Siam and China  But at what era this migration
commenced  whether  in the first instance  it was purely accidental
and subsequently gradual  or whether  originally  it was undertaken
from design  and accelerated  at any particular periods  by political
convulsions on the Continent  we cannot at present determine with any
certainty  as we have no data on which to rely with confidence  It
is probable  however  that the islands were peopled at a very remote
period  and long before the Birman and Siamese nations rose into
notice

Whatever opinion may be formed on the identity of the tribes inhabiting
these Islands and the neighbouring Peninsula  the striking resemblance
in person  feature  language  and customs  which prevails throughout
the whole Archipelago  justifies the conclusion  that its original
population issued from the same source  and that the peculiarities
which distinguish the different nations and communities into which it
is at present distributed  are the result of a long separation  local
circumstances  and the intercourse of foreign traders  emigrants  or
settlers

Excluding the Philippines  as distant from the scene of our present
observations  it may be noticed  that of the three chief nations in
these islands  occupying respectively Java  Sumatra  and Celebes  the
first has  especially by its moral habits  by its superior civilization
and improvements  obtained a broader and more marked characteristic
than the others  Both the Malayan and  BÃºgis  nations are maritime and
commercial  devoted to speculations of gain  animated by a spirit of
adventure  and accustomed to distant and hazardous enterprises  while
the Javans  on the contrary  are an agricultural race  attached to
the soil  of quiet habits and contented dispositions  almost entirely
unacquainted with navigation and foreign trade  and little inclined to
engage in either  This difference of character may perhaps be accounted
for  by the great superiority of the soil of Java to that of the other
two islands

It is to be regretted  that our information on the state and progress
of society in these islands is scanty  as Europeans only became
acquainted with them when they were on their decline  The Malayan
empire  which once extended over all Sumatra 35   and the capital of
which is still nominally at  MenÃ¡ng kÃ¡baÃ¹  on that island  had long
been dismembered  but its colonies were found established on the
coasts of the Peninsula and throughout the Islands  as far east as
the Moluccas  The Mahometan institutions had considerably obliterated
their ancient character  and had not only obstructed their improvement
but had accelerated their decline  Traditional history concurs with
existing monuments  in proving them to have formerly made considerable
advances in those arts  to which their industry and ingenuity were
particularly directed  and they still bear marks of that higher state
of civilization which they once enjoyed

What the Malayan empire was on Sumatra  in the western part of the
Archipelago  that of  Guah  or  MengkÃ¡sar   was on Celebes in the east
but the people of this latter nation  whom we may generally designate
by the name of  BÃºgis   had not been equally influenced by foreign
settlers nor exposed to the inroads of the Arab missionaries  and
they consequently maintained their ancient worship and their native
institutions for a longer period  Like the  MalÃ¡yus   they sent forth
numerous colonies  and at one period extended the success of their
arms as far west as Acheen on Sumatra  and  KÃ©ddah  on the Malayan
peninsula  and in almost every part of the Archipelago  Malayan and
BÃºgis  settlers and establishments are to be found

The Javans  on the contrary  being an agricultural people  are
seldom met with out of their native island  At one period of their
history  indeed  their power seems to have been exerted in acquiring
or perpetuating foreign dominion  and they seem to have sent out
colonies to Borneo  the Peninsula  Sumatra  and probably Celebes  but
when Europeans became acquainted with them  their external influence
appears to have been contracted  and their sovereignty nearly confined
within the limits of Java itself  Their foreign establishments thus
receiving from them no protection  and deriving no advantage from
nominal obedience  declared their independence  and  having but little
communication with the mother country  soon became assimilated to the
character  and merged into the body of the Malayan nation

The comparative advancement of these three nations in the arts of
civilized life  seems to be directly as the fertility of the soil they
occupied  or the inducements they held out to foreign intercourse  and
inversely  as the indulgence of their own roving  adventurous spirit
and piratical habits  The arts never fix their roots but in a crowded
population  and a crowded population is generally created only on a
fertile territory  Egypt  from the fertility of soil and the consequent
density of its population  led the way in science and refinement among
ancient nations  while the sterile tracts contiguous to that favoured
land have been inhabited  from primeval times  by dispersed tribes of
unimproved barbarians  In like manner  Java having become populous from
its natural fertility  and having  by its wealth and the salubrity of
its climate  invited the visits of more enlightened strangers  soon
made great progress in arts and knowledge  while the  BÃºgis   being
more deficient in these advantages  have been left considerably behind
in the race of improvement  They may lay claim  however  to the most
originality of character

It will be the object of another part of this work  to trace the
source of that foreign influence  to which these three nations are
principally indebted for their civilization  here  therefore  it
may not be necessary to advert to the circumstance further  than by
generally observing  that from western Asia they received the rudiments
and impulse of improvement  an inference abundantly justified by the
extensive remains of the arts  institutions  and languages of that
country  which are still to be found throughout the Archipelago

The inhabitants of Java and MadÃºra are in stature rather below the
middle size  though not so short as the  BÃºgis  and many of the
other islanders  They are  upon the whole  well shaped  though less
remarkably so than the  MalÃ¡yus   and erect in their figures  Their
limbs are slender  and the wrists and ankles particularly small
In general  they allow the body to retain its natural shape  The
only exceptions to this observation are  an attempt to prevent the
growth  or to reduce the size of the waist  by compressing it into
the narrowest limits  and the practice still more injurious to female
elegance  of drawing too tightly that part of the dress which covers
the bosom  Deformity is very rare among them  The forehead is high
the eyebrows well marked and distant from the eyes  which are somewhat
Chinese  or rather Tartar  in the formation of the inner angle  The
colour of the eye is dark  the nose small and somewhat flat  but less
so than that of the islanders in general  The mouth is well formed  but
the lips are large  and their beauty generally injured by the practice
of filing and dyeing the teeth black  and by the use of tobacco
sÃ¡ri    c  The cheek bones are usually prominent  the beard very
scanty  the hair of the head generally lank and black  but sometimes
waving in curls  and partially tinged with a deep reddish brown colour
The countenance is mild  placid and thoughtful  and easily expresses
respect  gaiety  earnestness  indifference  bashfulness  or anxiety

In complexion  the Javans  as well as the other eastern islanders
may be considered rather as a yellow than a copper coloured or black
race  Their standard of beauty  in this respect  is  a virgin gold
colour   except perhaps in some few districts in the mountainous parts
of the country  where a ruddy tinge is occasioned by the climate
they want the degree of red requisite to give them a copperish hue
It may be observed  however  that they are generally darker than
the tribes of the neighbouring islands  especially the inhabitants
of the eastern districts  who may indeed be considered as having
more delicate features  and bearing a more distinct impression of
Indian colonization  than those of the Western or  SÃºnda  districts
The  SÃºndas  exhibit many features of a mountainous race  They are
shorter  stouter  hardier  and more active men  than the inhabitants
of the coast and eastern districts  In some respects they resemble the
Madurese  who display a more martial and independent air  and move with
a bolder carriage than the natives of Java  A considerable difference
exists in person and features between the higher and lower classes
more indeed than seems attributable to difference of employment and
treatment  The features and limbs of the chiefs are more delicate  and
approach more nearly to those of the inhabitants of Western India
while those of the common people retain more marked traces of the stock
from which the islands were originally peopled  In colour there are
many different shades in different families and different districts
some being much darker than others  Among many of the chiefs a strong
mixture of the Chinese is clearly discernible  the Arab features are
seldom found  except among the priests  and some few families of the
highest rank

The women  in general  are not so good looking as the men  and to
Europeans many of them  particularly when advanced in years  appear
hideously ugly  But among the lower orders  much of this deficiency of
personal comeliness is doubtless to be attributed to the severe duties
which they have to perform in the field  to the hardships they have to
undergo in carrying oppressive burdens  and to exposure in a sultry
climate  On the neighbouring island of  BÃ¡li   where the condition
of the women among the peasantry does not appear by any means so
oppressed and degraded  they exhibit considerable personal beauty  and
even on Java  the higher orders of them being kept within doors  have a
very decided superiority in this respect

In manners the Javans are easy and courteous  and respectful even to
timidity  they have a great sense of propriety  and are never rude or
abrupt  In their deportment they are pliant and graceful  the people
of condition carrying with them a considerable air of fashion  and
receiving the gaze of the curious without being at all disconcerted
In their delivery they are in general very circumspect and even slow
though not deficient in animation when necessary

Here  as on Sumatra  there are certain mountainous districts  in which
the people are subject to those large wens in the throat  termed in
Europe  goitres   The cause is generally ascribed by the natives to the
quality of the water  but there seems good ground for concluding  that
it is rather to be traced to the atmosphere  In proof of this it may
be mentioned  that there is a village near the foot of the  Teng gar
mountains  in the eastern part of the island  where every family is
afflicted by this malady  while in another village  situated at a
greater elevation  and through which the stream descends which serves
for the use of both  there exists no such deformity  These wens are
considered hereditary in some families  and seem thus independent of
situation  A branch of the family of the present  AdipÃ¡ti  of  BÃ¡ndung
is subject to them  and it is remarkable that they prevail chiefly
among the women in that family  They neither produce positive suffering
nor occasion early death  and may be considered rather as deformities
than diseases  It is never attempted to remove them

The population of Java is very unequally distributed  whether we
consider the fertility or the extent of the districts over which it is
spread  The great mass of it lies in the eastern and native districts
as will be perceived from the annexed tables

The table No  I   is compiled from materials collected by a committee
appointed on the first establishment of the British government  to
enquire and report on the state of the country  It will be found to
illustrate  in some degree  the proportionate numbers of the different
ranks and classes of society in the island  Beyond this  however  it
cannot be depended upon  as the returns of which it is an abstract were
made at a period when the Dutch system of administration provisionally
remained in force  and every new enquiry into the state of the country
being at that time considered by the people as a prelude to some
new tax or oppression  it became an object with them to conceal the
full extent of the population  accordingly it was found to differ
essentially in amount from the results of information subsequently
obtained on the introduction of the detailed land revenue settlement
when an agreement with each individual cultivator becoming necessary
to the security of his possession  he seldom failed to satisfy the
necessary enquiries  The table No  II   here exhibited  at least as
far as regards the European provinces  may therefore be considered as
faithful a view of the population of the country as could be expected
and as such  notwithstanding the inaccuracies to which all such
accounts are liable  it is presented with some confidence to the public

It was formed in the following manner  A detailed account of the
peasantry of each village was first taken  containing the name of
each male inhabitant  with other particulars  and from the aggregate
of these village lists a general statement was constructed of the
inhabitants of each subdivision and district  An abstract was again
drawn up from these provincial accounts  exhibiting the state of each
residency in which the districts were respectively included  and the
totals of these last  collected into one tabular view  constitute the
present abstract  The labour of this detailed survey was considerable
for as each individual cultivator was to receive a lease corresponding
with the register taken  it was necessary that the land he rented
should be carefully measured and assessed 36

 MEM   The Population of the principal European capitals included in the
 above  is estimated as follows

 Batavia and its immediate Suburbs  60 000
 SemÃ¡rang                           20 000
 SurabÃ¡ya                           25 000

 The population of  SÃºra kÃ©rta   the principal Native capital  is
 estimated at 105 000

 That of  YÃºgya kÃ©rta  at somewhat less

By the last table  it appears that in some districts the population
is in the ratio of two hundred and eighty one to a square mile  while
in others it is not more than twenty four and three quarters  in the
districts of  BanyuwÃ¡ngÃ­  it is even as low as seven  The soil in
the eastern districts is generally considered superior to that in
the western  and this circumstance  added to the superior facilities
which they afford to commerce  may serve to account for their original
selection as the chief seat of the native government  and consequently
for their denser population at an early period

This disproportion was also promoted by the policy of the Dutch
Company  The Dutch first established themselves in the western
division  and having no confidence in the natives  endeavoured to drive
them from the vicinity of Batavia  with the view of establishing round
their metropolis an extensive and desert barrier  The forced services
and forced deliveries  which extended wherever Dutch influence could
be felt  and of which more will be said hereafter  contributed to
impoverish  and thereby to depopulate the country  The drain also of
the surrounding districts  to supply the place of the multitudes who
perished by the unhealthy climate of Batavia  must have been enormous
and if to these we add the checks to population  which were created
over Bantam  the  PriÃ¡ng en  Regencies  and ChÃ©ribon  in the pepper
and coffee cultivation  of the nature of which an account will be
given when treating of the agriculture of the country  we need go no
further to account for the existing disproportion  It was only about
sixty years ago that the Dutch government first obtained a decided
influence in the eastern districts  and from that moment  the provinces
subjected to its authority ceased to improve  and extensive emigrations
took place into the dominions of the native princes  Such were the
effects of this desolating system  that the population of the province
of  BanyuwÃ¡ngi   which in 1750 is said to have amounted to upwards of
eighty thousand souls  was in 1811 reduced to eight thousand

The  PriÃ¡ng en  Regencies  from their inland situation and mountainous
character  may probably have at all times been less closely peopled
than other parts of the island  and their insufficient population
would furnish no proofs of the oppressions of government  did we not
observe extensive tracts  nay whole districts  exhibiting the traces
of former cultivation  now lying waste and overgrown with long rank
grass  ChÃ©ribon and Bantam have shared the same fate  These provinces
according to authentic accounts  were at the period of the first
establishment of the European government  among the richest and most
populous of the island  In 1811 they were found in a state of extreme
poverty  affording little or no revenue  and distracted by all the
aggravated miseries of continued insurrections

If we look at Calcutta  Madras  and Bombay  the capitals of the British
government in India  if we look at the great cities of every nation
in Europe  nay  if we even confine ourselves to the capitals of the
native princes on Java  we shall find that population has always
accumulated in their vicinity  And why was not this the case with the
Dutch capital  The climate alone will not explain it  Bad government
was the principal cause  a system of policy which secured neither
person nor property  selfish  jealous  vexatious  and tyrannical  It
is no less true than remarkable  that wherever the Dutch influence has
prevailed in the Eastern Seas  depopulation has followed  The Moluccas
particularly have suffered at least as much as any part of Java  and
the population of those Islands  reduced as it is  has been equally
oppressed and degraded

It was fortunate for the interests of humanity  and for the importance
of Java  that the native governments were less oppressive than the
sway of their European conquerors  and that their states afforded a
retreat from a more desolating tyranny  It has been ascertained  that
on the first establishment of the Dutch in the eastern part of the
Island  the inhabitants of whole districts at once migrated into the
native provinces  Every new act of rigour  every unexpected exaction
occasioned a further migration  and cultivation was transferred to
tracts which had previously scarcely a family on them  This state of
things continued down to the latest date of the Dutch government
During the administration of Marshal Daendels  in the years 1808  1809
and 1810  nearly all the inhabitants of the province of  DemÃ¡k   one of
the richest in the eastern districts  fled into the native provinces
and when an order was given for the rigid enforcement of the coffee
monopoly  every district suffered in its population  in proportion to
the extent of service levied upon it  Of the sacrifice of lives by
thousands and tens of thousands  to fill the ranks of the Dutch native
army  and to construct roads and public works  we shall speak more at
large hereafter

The total population of Java and MadÃºra appears from the Table No  II
to amount to 4 615 270  of which about four millions and a half may be
considered as the indigenous population of the country  and the rest as
foreign settlers  Itinerants  who are principally found along the coast
in the different maritime and commercial capitals  are not included
neither is the nautical population  which cannot be estimated at less
than 30 000 souls  so that the whole population of these two islands
may  perhaps  be taken in round numbers at not much less than five
millions  Of these not less than three millions are in the provinces
immediately subject to European authority  and upwards of a million and
a half in the provinces of the native princes

While the British were in possession of Java  there is reason to
believe that the population of the Island was rapidly increasing
that of the provinces immediately under the European authority was
certainly augmented by the return of numerous families from emigration
but previously to that period  no such authentic registers were kept
as might enable us to ascertain with precision the variations in the
number of the inhabitants during the Dutch government

Nothing can more completely shew the vague and defective information
formerly attainable on this subject  than the loose and contradictory
statements published by those who took most pains to be well informed
and who felt it their duty to collect all the light that could
be attained  In some accounts which have met the public eye  the
population of Java is placed on a level with that of the most powerful
European states  and assumed as high as thirty millions  while in
others  where one would expect more accuracy 39   it is rated at only
a million  The most respectable authorities 40  state the population
about a century ago at three millions  but the slightest reflection
will convince us  that such an estimate must have proceeded upon data
merely conjectural  for from our knowledge of the Dutch maxims of
administration we may safely say  that until very lately  they never
thought it an object to prosecute statistic enquiries  and that if ever
they had done so  under the old system  they could have obtained no
results deserving of confidence or credit

About the year 1750  a certain number of families were assigned by the
stipulations of a treaty to one of the native princes 41   and on his
death  about thirty years afterwards  when an account was taken of this
population  it appeared that the number of families had nearly doubled
But this increase cannot be taken as the average increase of the
Island  for at this period the native provinces received a considerable
accession to their numbers  in consequence of the emigrations from the
Dutch territories

If any inference can be drawn from this and other corresponding
circumstances  it would seem  that notwithstanding the drains on the
existing race  and the preventive checks to an increase  which were
experienced during the latter years of the Dutch administration  the
island was actually more populous in 1811  when it was surrendered to
the British  than in 1750  when at the termination of a destructive
war  the Dutch acquired the greatest portion of it from the natives

To support the opinion of an increase within the last half century
which is every where asserted  we have the assurance  that during that
period the greatest internal tranquillity prevailed in the provinces
subject to native administration  that no years of scarcity and famine
were experienced  and that the island was blessed with genial seasons
and abundance of subsistence  But to place in the opposite scale  we
have the government oppressions to which we formerly alluded  and which
one would suppose sufficient to counteract the natural tendency of
these advantages  As demonstrative of the strength of that principle
of population  which could even maintain its stationary amount in
conflict with political drains and discouragements  it may be proper
to mention cursorily a few of them  Great demands were  at all times
made on the peasantry of the island  to recruit the ranks of the Dutch
army  and to supply the many other wants of the public service  the
severities and consequent mortality to which the troops were liable
may be calculated  from the reluctance of the unfortunate wretches
selected as victims of military conscription  to engage in the duties
of a military life  Confined in unhealthy garrisons  exposed to
unnecessary hardships and privations  extraordinary casualties took
place among them  and frequent new levies became necessary  while
the anticipation of danger and suffering produced an aversion to the
service  which was only aggravated by the subsequent measures of
cruelty and oppression  The conscripts raised in the provinces were
usually sent to the metropolis by water  and though the distance be
but short between any two points of the island  a mortality  similar
to that of a slave ship in the middle passage  took place on board
these receptacles of reluctant recruits  They were generally confined
in the stocks till their arrival at Batavia  and it is calculated
that for every man that entered the army and performed the duties of
a soldier  several lives were lost  Besides the supply of the army
one half of the male population of the country was constantly held
in readiness for other public services  and thus a great portion of
the effective hands were taken from their families  and detained at a
distance from home  in labours which broke their spirit and exhausted
their strength  During the administration of Marshal Daendels  it has
been calculated that the construction of public roads alone  destroyed
the lives of at least ten thousand workmen  The transport of government
stores  and the capricious requisitions of government agents of all
classes  perpetually harassed  and frequently carried off numbers of
the people  If to these drains we add the waste of life occasioned
by insurrections  which tyranny and impolicy excited and fomented in
ChÃ©ribon  the blighting effects of the coffee monopoly  and forced
services in the  PriÃ¡ng en  Regencies  and the still more desolating
operation of the policy pursued and consequent anarchy produced in the
province of Bantam  we shall have some idea of the depopulating causes
that existed under the Dutch administration  and the force of that
tendency to increase  which could overcome obstacles so powerful

Most of these drains and checks were removed during the short period of
British administration  but it is to be regretted  so far as accurate
data on this subject would be desirable  that there was not time to
learn satisfactorily the result of a different system  or to institute
the proper registers  by which alone questions of population can be
determined  The only document of that kind  to which I can venture
to refer as authentic  is a statement of the births and deaths that
occurred in the given general population of the  PriÃ¡ng en  Regencies
for one year  From this account it would appear  that even in these
Regencies  where  if we except Batavia  the checks to population
are allowed to be greater than elsewhere  the births were to the
total existing population as 1 to 39  and the deaths as 1 to 40 very
nearly  that the births exceed the deaths by 618  or about 1 in 40
in a population of 232 000  and that  at that rate  the population
would double itself in three hundred and seventy five years  A slow
increase  certainly  compared with England  where the births  in the
three years ending 1800  were to the persons alive as 1 in 36  and the
deaths as 1 to 49  and where  consequently  the nation would double
itself in one hundred and sixty years  or taking the enumeration of
1811 as more correct  where the population would be doubled in eighty
years   but not much slower than that of France  where  according to
the statements of numbers in 1700 and 1790  about three hundred years
would be required to double the inhabitants  It has been estimated that
the population in some more favourable districts would double itself in
fifty years  One inference cannot fail to be drawn from the register to
which I have referred  that the births and deaths  though they nearly
approach each other  are low  compared with the existing numbers  and
that  consequently  the climate is healthy  and the marriages not very
prolific  as far as this district is concerned

In the absence of authentic documents  which would have enabled us to
resolve many interesting questions regarding the population  such as
the number of children to a marriage  the ordinary length of life  the
proportion of children that die in infancy and at the other stages
of life  the ratio between the births and deaths  and the consequent
rate of increase  the effect of polygamy and multiplied divorces  the
comparative healthiness of the towns and the villages  and several
others   I shall state a few observations on some of these heads  and
a few facts tending to shew  that under a better system of government
or by the removal of a few of the checks that previously existed  Java
might  in a short time  be expected to be better peopled

The soil is in general extremely fertile  and can be brought to yield
its produce with little labour  Many of the best spots still remain
uncultivated  and several districts are almost desert and neglected
which might be the seats of a crowded and happy peasantry  In many
places  the land does not require to be cleared  as in America  from
the overgrown vegetation of primeval forests  but offers its services
to the husbandman  almost free from every obstruction to his immediate
labours  The agricultural life in which the mass of the people are
engaged  is on Java  as in every other country  the most favourable to
health  It not only favours the longevity of the existing race  but
conduces to its more rapid renewal  by leading to early marriages and a
numerous progeny  The term of life is not much shorter than in the best
climates of Europe  A very considerable number of persons of both sexes
attain the advanced age of seventy or eighty  and some even live to
one hundred and upwards  nearly the same proportion survive forty and
fifty  as in other genial climates

While life is thus healthy and prolonged  there are no restraints upon
the formation of family connexions  by the scarcity of subsistence
or the labour of supporting children  Both sexes arrive at maturity
very early  and the customs of the country  as well as the nature of
the climate  impel them to marry young  the males at sixteen  and the
females at thirteen or fourteen years of age  though frequently the
women form connexions at nine or ten  and  as Montesquieu expresses it
infancy and marriage go together   The conveniences which the married
couple require are few and easily procured  The impulse of nature is
seldom checked by the experience of present deficiencies  or the fear
of future poverty  Subsistence is procured without difficulty  and
comforts are not wanting  Children  who are for a very short period a
burden to their parents  become early the means of assistance and the
source of wealth  To the peasant who labours his field with his own
hand  and who has more land than he can bring into cultivation  they
grow up into a species of valuable property  a real treasure  while
during their infancy and the season of helplessness  they take little
from the fruits of his industry but bare subsistence

Their education costs him little or nothing  scarcely any clothing is
required  his hut needs very little enlargement  and no beds are used
Many of them die in infancy from the small pox and other distempers
but never from scanty food or criminal neglect of parents  The women of
all classes suckle their children  till we ascend to the wives of the
regents and of the sovereign  who employ nurses

Though women soon arrive at maturity  and enter early into the married
state  they continue to bear children to an advanced age  and it is
no uncommon thing to see a grandmother still making addition to her
family  Great families are however rare  Though there are some women
who have borne thirteen or fourteen children  the average is rather
low than otherwise  A  chÃ¡cha   or family  is generally less numerous
than in Europe  both from the circumstance that the young men and women
more early leave the houses of their parents to form establishments
for themselves  and from an injudicious mode of labouring among women
of the lower ranks  Miscarriages among the latter are frequently
caused by over straining themselves in carrying excessive burdens  and
performing oppressive field work  during pregnancy  The average number
of persons in a family does not exceed four  or four and a half  As
the labour of the women is almost equally productive with that of the
men  female children become as much objects of solicitude with their
parents as male  they are nursed with the same care  and viewed with
the same pride and tenderness  In no class of society are children of
either sex considered as an incumbrance  or the addition to a family as
a misfortune  marriage is therefore almost universal  An unmarried man
past twenty is seldom to be met with  and an old maid is considered a
curiosity  Neither custom  law  or religion  enjoins celibacy on the
priesthood  or any other order of the community  and by none of them is
it practised  Although no strictness of principle  nor strong sense of
moral restraint  prevails in the intercourse of the sexes  prostitution
is not common  except in the capitals

As the Javans are a quiet domestic people  little given to adventure
disinclined to foreign enterprise  not easily roused to violence or
bloodshed  and little disposed to irregularities of any kind  there
are but few families left destitute in consequence of hazards incurred
or crimes committed by their natural protectors  The character of
blood thirsty revenge  which has been attributed to all the inhabitants
of the Indian Archipelago  by no means applies to the people of Java
and though  in all cases where justice is badly administered or
absolutely perverted  people may be expected to enforce their rights
or redress their grievances  rather by their own passions than by an
appeal to the magistrate  comparatively few lives are lost on the
island by personal affrays or private feuds

Such are a few of the circumstances that would appear to have
encouraged an increase of population on Java  They furnish no precise
data on which to estimate its rapidity  or to calculate the period
within which it would be doubled  but they allow us  if tranquillity
and good government were enjoyed  to anticipate a gradual progress in
the augmentation of inhabitants  and the improvements of the soil for
a long course of time  Suppose the quantity of land in cultivation to
be to the land still in a state of nature as one to seven  which is
probably near the truth  and that  in the ordinary circumstances of the
country  the population would double itself in a century  it might go
on increasing for three hundred years to come  Afterwards the immense
tracts of unoccupied or thinly peopled territories on Sumatra  Borneo
and the numerous islands scattered over the Archipelago  may be ready
to receive colonies  arts  and civilization from the metropolis of the
Indian seas  Commercial intercourse  friendly relations  or political
institutions  may bind these dispersed communities in one great insular
commonwealth  Its trade and navigation might connect the centre of
this great empire with Japan  China  and the south western countries
of Asia  New Holland  which the adventurous  BÃºgis  already frequent
and which is not so far distant from Java as Russia is from England
might be included in the circle  and colonies of Javans settled on the
north  might meet with the British spreading from the south  over that
immense and now uncultivated region  If we could indulge ourselves
in such reveries with propriety  we might contemplate the present
semi barbarous condition  ignorance  and poverty of these innumerable
islands  exchanged for a state of refinement  prosperity  and happiness

I formerly alluded to the oppressions of government  as the principal
checks to the increase of population on Java  There are many others
such as the small pox  and other diseases  which are common to that
country with the rest of the world  From the scattered state of
the population  any contagious distemper  such as the small pox
was formerly less destructive on Java  than in countries where the
inhabitants are more crowded into large towns  and it is hoped that
from the establishment for vaccine inoculation which the British
government erected  and endeavoured to render permanent  its ravages
may  in time  be entirely arrested  The diseases most peculiar to the
country  and most dangerous at all ages  are fevers and dysenteries
epidemics are rare  There are two moral causes which  on their first
mention  will strike every one as powerfully calculated to counteract
the principle of population  I mean the facility of obtaining divorces
and the practice of polygamy  A greater weight should not  however
be given them than they deserve after a consideration of all the
circumstances  It is true  that separations often take place on the
slightest grounds  and new connexions are formed with equal frivolity
and caprice  but in whatever light morality would view this practice
and however detrimental it would be to population in a different state
of society  by leaving the children of the marriage so dissolved to
neglect and want  it has no such consequences on Java  Considering
the age at which marriages are usually contracted  the choice of the
parties cannot be always expected to be considerate or judicious  It
may be observed also that the women  although they do not appear old at
twenty  as Montesquieu remarks  certainly sooner lose that influence
over their husbands  which depends upon their beauty and personal
attractions  than they do in colder climates  In addition to this
there is little moral restraint among many classes of the community
and the religious maxims and indulgences acted upon by the priesthood
in regulating matrimonial sanctions  have no tendency to produce
constancy  or to repress inclination  Dissolutions of marriage are
therefore  very frequent  and obtained upon the slightest pretences
but  as children are always valuable  and as there is very little
trouble in rearing or providing for them  no change of mate  in either
party  leads to their abandonment or neglect  Indeed  the ease of
supporting children  which renders the practice less detrimental to
the increase of population  may be one of the principal causes why it
is generally followed and so little checked  No professed prostitution
or promiscuous intercourse is the consequence of this weakness of the
nuptial tie  It is rather brittle than loose  it is easily dissolved
but while it remains it generally insures fidelity

Polygamy  though in all cases it must be injurious to population
and happiness  so far as it goes  is permitted on Java  as in other
Mahomedan countries  by religion and law  but not practiced to any
great extent  Perhaps the ease of obtaining matrimonial separations
by admitting of successive changes of wives  diminishes the desire of
possessing more than one at a time

It is plain  likewise  that whatever be the law  the great body of
the people must have only one wife  and that  where there is nearly
an equality of number between the sexes  inequality of wealth or
power alone can create an unequal distribution of women  On Java
accordingly  only the chiefs and the sovereign marry more than one
wife  All the chiefs  from the regents downwards  can only  by the
custom of the country  have two  the sovereign alone has four  The
regents  however  have generally three or four concubines  and the
sovereign eight or ten  Some of the chiefs have an extraordinary
number of children  the late Regent of  TÃºban  is reputed to have
been the father of no fewer than sixty eight  Such appropriations of
numerous women as wives or concubines  were owing to the political
power of native authorities over the inferior classes  and as  by
the new system  that power is destroyed  the evil may to a certain
extent be checked  If we were to depend upon the statement of a writer
whom Montesquieu refers to  that in Bantam there were ten women to
one man  we should be led to conclude with him  that here was a case
particularly favourable to polygamy  and that such an institution was
here an appointment of nature  intended for the multiplication of
the species  rather than an abuse contributing to check it  There is
not the least foundation  however  for the report  The proportion
of males and females born in Bantam  and over the whole of Java  is
nearly the same as in Europe  and as we find generally to exist
wherever accurate statements can be obtained  From the information
collected in a very careful surrey of one part of the very province in
question  the preponderance seemed to be on the side of male children
to an extraordinary degree  the male children being about forty two
thousand  and the females only thirty five thousand five hundred
There were formerly  it is true  great drains on the male population
to which I have before alluded  and which  in the advanced stages
of life  might turn the balance on the other side  but as they were
never so destructive as to render polygamy a political institution
so that institution was not carried to such an extent  as to render
it a peculiar obstacle to the progress of population  Upon the whole
we may conclude that in Java  under a mild government  there is a
great tendency to an increase in the number of inhabitants  and to the
consequent improvement and importance of the island

Besides the natives  whose numbers  circumstances  and character I
have slightly mentioned  there is on Java a rapidly increasing race
of foreigners  who have emigrated from the different surrounding
countries  The most numerous and important class of these is the
Chinese  who already do not fall far short of a hundred thousand  and
who  with a system of free trade and free cultivation  would soon
accumulate tenfold  by natural increase within the island  and gradual
accessions of new settlers from home  They reside principally in the
three capitals of Batavia   SamÃ¡rang   and  SurabÃ¡ya   but they are to
be found in all the smaller capitals  and scattered over most parts of
the country  A great proportion of them are descended from families
who have been many generations on the island  Additions are gradually
making to their numbers  They arrive at Batavia from China  to the
amount of a thousand and more annually  in Chinese junks  carrying
three  four  and five hundred each  without money or resources  but
by dint of their industry  soon acquire comparative opulence  There
are no women on Java who come directly from China  but as the Chinese
often marry the daughters of their countrymen by Javan women  there
results a numerous mixed race  which is often scarcely distinguishable
from the native Chinese  The Chinese on their arrival generally marry
a Javan woman  or purchase a slave from the other islands  The progeny
from this connexion  or what may be termed the cross breed between the
Chinese and Javans  are called in the Dutch accounts  pernÃ¡kans   Many
return to China annually in the junks  but by no means in the same
numbers as they arrive

The Chinese  in all matters of inheritance and minor affairs  are
governed by their own laws  administered by their own chiefs  a captain
and several lieutenants being appointed by government for each society
of them  They are distinct from the natives  and are in a high degree
more intelligent  more laborious  and more luxurious  They are the life
and soul of the commerce of the country  In the native provinces they
are still farmers of the revenue  having formerly been so throughout
the island

Although still numerous  they are considered to have much decreased
since the civil war in 1742  during which not only a large proportion
of the Chinese population was massacred by the Dutch in the town of
Batavia  but a decree of extermination was proclaimed against them
throughout the island

The natives of the Coromandel and Malabar coast  who reside on Java
are usually termed Moors  They appear to be the remnant of a once
extensive class of settlers  but their numbers have considerably
decreased  since the establishment of the Dutch monopoly  and the
absolute extinction of the native trade with India  which we have
reason to believe was once very extensive  Trading vessels  in
considerable numbers  still continue to proceed from the Coromandel
coast to Sumatra  Penang  and Malacca  but they no longer frequent Java

BÃºgis  and  MalÃ¡yus  are established in all the maritime capitals of
Java  They have their own quarter of the town allotted to them  in the
same manner as the Chinese  and are subject to the immediate authority
of their respective captains

Among the Arabs are many merchants  but the majority are priests  Their
principal resort is  GrÃ©sik   the spot where Mahomedanism was first
extensively planted on Java  They are seldom of genuine Arab birth  but
mostly a mixed race  between the Arabs and the natives of the islands

There is another class of inhabitants  either foreigners themselves
or the immediate descendants of foreigners  whose peculiar situation
and considerable numbers entitle them to some notice in the general
sketch of the population  I mean the class of slaves  The native
Javans are never reduced to this condition  or if they should happen
to be seized and sold by pirates  a satisfactory proof of their origin
would be sufficient to procure their enfranchisement  The slave
merchants have therefore been under the necessity of resorting to the
neighbouring islands for a supply  and the greatest number have been
procured from  BÃ¡li  and Celebes  The total amount may be estimated at
about thirty thousand  According to the returns obtained in 1814  it
appeared that the following were the numbers in the principal divisions
of the island

 At Batavia and its environs         18 972
 In the SemÃ¡rang division             4 488
 In the SurabÃ¡ya division             3 682

                              Total  27 142


These slaves are the property of the Europeans and Chinese alone  the
native chiefs never require the services of slaves  or engage in the
traffic of slavery  The Mahomedan laws  which regulate their civil
condition  and permit this abomination in all its extent  are modified
by the milder prejudices and more humane temper of the country  The
Dutch  who  like us  valued themselves on their political liberty  are
here the great promoters of civil servitude  and carried with them into
their eastern empire  the Roman law regarding slavery in all its extent
and rigour  But although they adopted principles that admitted of the
most cruel and wanton treatment of slaves  I would not be understood
to say  that they carried these principles into common practice  The
contrary was almost universally the case  and the condition of slaves
on Java  where they were employed principally in domestic offices
formed a complete contrast to the state of those employed in the West
India plantations  It is remarked by Montesquieu  that  in despotic
countries  the condition of a slave is hardly more burdensome than that
of a subject   and such has been the case in Java  The grounds on which
the Dutch justified the practice of making slaves  was not that they
could not command the services of the natives with a sway sufficiently
absolute  and that they were compelled to seek  beyond the limits of
the island  for unfortunate agents to perform what the natives shewed
a reluctance to undertake  but that they found the class of foreigners
more adroit and docile than the Javans in the conduct of household
affairs  and that having reduced them to the state of property  they
remained in the family for life  and saved the trouble of a new
training

Upon the conquest of the island by the British in 1811  the condition
of this class of its subjects excited the attention of government  and
though we could not  consistently with those rights of property which
were admitted by the laws that we professed to administer  emancipate
them at once from servitude  we enacted regulations  as far as we were
authorized  to ameliorate their present lot  and lead to their ultimate
freedom  Steps were immediately taken to check further importation  and
as soon as it was known that the horrid traffic in slaves was declared
a felony by the British parliament  it was not permitted for an instant
to disgrace a region to which the British authority extended  The folly
and perfect uselessness of slavery on Java has been often pointed out
by Dutch commissioners and Dutch authors 42

Having thus attempted a brief description of the different classes
of the Asiatic population of the island  I shall proceed to a short
detail of the habitations  dress  food  and domestic economy of the
natives  but  in order to enable the reader to understand some of the
terms in the tables  and likewise in the subsequent observations  it
may not be improper simply to state the names and titles expressive
of the different gradations of rank  leaving a more particular
account of the power and authority with which they are connected to
another opportunity  The sovereign  who is either called  SusuhÃºnan
SusÃºnan   or  Sultan   is the fountain of honour and the source of
all distinction  His family are called  Pang Ã©rans   his queen  RÃ¡tu
the heir apparent  PangÃ©ran adipÃ¡ti   and the prime minister  RÃ¡den
adipÃ¡ti   Governors of provinces  called by the Dutch  Regents   are
styled by the natives  BopÃ¡tis    TumÃºngungs   or  Ang abÃ©is   and
are ranked among the chief nobility of the country  All the inferior
chiefs  including those termed  RÃ¡dens    MÃ¡ntris    DemÃ¡ngs    LÃºras
and others  except the heads of villages  termed  KÃºwus    BÃºkuls
PatÃ­ng gis    c   who are elected by the common people out of their
own number for the performance of specific duties  may be considered as
petite noblesse

The cottage or hut of the peasant  called  Ãºmah limÃ¡san   may be
estimated to cost  in its first construction  from two to four rupees
or from five to ten shillings English money  It is invariably built
on the ground  as on continental India  and in this respect differs
from similar structures in the surrounding islands  The sleeping
places  however  are generally a little elevated above the level of the
floor  and accord in simplicity with the other parts of the dwelling
The sides or walls are generally formed of  bÃ¡mbus   flattened and
plaited together  partitions  if any  are constructed of the same
materials  and the roof is either thatched with long grass  with the
leaves of the  nipa   or with a kind of  bÃ¡mbu sirap   The form and
size of these cottages  as well as the materials employed in their
construction  vary in the different districts of the island  and
with the different circumstances of the individuals  In the eastern
districts  where the population is most dense and the land most highly
cultivated  a greater scarcity is felt of the requisite materials than
in the western  and the dwellings of the peasantry are consequently
smaller and slighter  In the latter  the frame work of the cottages
is generally made of timber  instead of  bÃ¡mbus   and the interior of
them  as well as the front veranda  is raised about two feet from the
ground  The accommodations consist of a room partitioned off for the
heads of the family  and an open apartment on the opposite side for the
children  there is no window either made or requisite  The light is
admitted through the door alone  nor is this deficiency productive of
any inconvenience in a climate  where all domestic operations can be
carried on in the open air  and where shade from the sun  rather than
shelter from the weather  is required  The women perform their usual
occupations of spinning or weaving on an elevated veranda in front
where they are protected from the rays of a vertical sun by an extended
projection of the pitch of the roof  In some of the mountainous
districts  where the rains descend with most violence  the inhabitants
provide against their effects  by constructing their roofs of  bÃ¡mbus
split into halves  and applied to each other by their alternate concave
and convex surfaces  all along the pitch of the roof  from the top down
to the walls  On the whole  it may be affirmed that the habitations of
the peasantry of Java  even those constructed in the most unfavourable
situations and inhabited by the lowest of the people  admit of a
considerable degree of comfort and convenience  and far exceed  in
those respects  what falls to the lot of the peasant in most parts of
continental India

The class of dwellings inhabited by the petty chiefs are termed  Ãºmah
chÃ©bluk  or  Ãºmah jÃ³glo   These are distinguished by having eight
slopes or roofs  four superior and four secondary  Their value is from
seven to eight dollars  or from thirty five to forty shillings

The largest class of houses  or those in which the chiefs and nobles
reside  are termed  Ãºmah tÃºmpang   and are of the same form as the
preceding  they are generally distinguished from them by their greater
size  which varies with the means and rank of the possessor  and
usually contain five or six rooms  The supports and beams are of wood
The value of such a habitation  calculated to answer the circumstances
of an ordinary chief of the rank of a  PÃ¡teh   or assistant to the
governor of a province  may be about fifty or sixty dollars  or from
ten to fifteen pounds sterling

In the European provinces  the size and comfort of these dwellings have
of late been very essentially contracted  by the rigid enforcement
of the monopoly of the teak forests  which were formerly open to the
natives of all classes

Brick dwellings  which are sometimes  though rarely  occupied by the
natives  are termed  Ãºmah gedÃ³ng   This kind of building is for the
most part occupied by the Chinese  who invariably construct a building
of brick and mortar whenever they possess the means  The Chinese
kÃ¡mpongs  may always be thus distinguished from those of the natives

The cottages  which I have already described  are never found detached
or solitary  they always unite to form villages of greater or less
extent  according to the fertility of the neighbouring plain  abundance
of a stream  or other accidental circumstances  In some provinces
the usual number of inhabitants in a village is about two hundred  in
others less than fifty  In the first establishment or formation of
a village on new ground  the intended settlers take care to provide
themselves with sufficient garden ground round their huts for their
stock  and to supply the ordinary wants of their families  The
produce of this plantation is the exclusive property of the peasant
and exempted from contribution or burden  and such is their number
and extent in some regencies  as in  KedÃº  for instance   that they
constitute perhaps a tenth part of the area of the whole district  The
spot surrounding his simple habitation  the cottager considers his
peculiar patrimony  and cultivates with peculiar care  He labours to
plant and to rear in it those vegetables that may be most useful to his
family  and those shrubs and trees which may at once yield him their
fruit and their shade  nor does he waste his efforts on a thankless
soil  The cottages  or the assemblage of huts  that compose the
village  become thus completely screened from the rays of a scorching
sun  and are so buried amid the foliage of a luxuriant vegetation
that at a small distance no appearance of a human dwelling can be
discovered  and the residence of a numerous society appears only a
verdant grove or a clump of ever greens  Nothing can exceed the beauty
or the interest  which such detached masses of verdure  scattered over
the face of the country  and indicating each the abode of a collection
of happy peasantry  add to scenery otherwise rich  whether viewed on
the sides of the mountains  in the narrow vales  or on the extensive
plains  In the last case  before the grain is planted  and during the
season of irrigation  when the rice fields are inundated  they appear
like so many small Islands  rising out of the water  As the young plant
advances  their deep rich foliage contrasts pleasingly with its lighter
tints  and when the full eared grain  with a luxuriance that exceeds
an European harvest  invests the earth with its richest yellow  they
give a variety to the prospect  and afford a most refreshing relief to
the eye  The clumps of trees  with which art attempts to diversify and
adorn the most skilfully arranged park  can bear no comparison with
them in rural beauty or picturesque effect

As the population increases  the extent of individual appropriations is
sometimes contracted  but when there is sufficient untenanted ground in
the neighbourhood  a new village is thrown out at some distance  which
during its infancy remains under the charge  and on the responsibility
of the parent village  In time  however  it obtains a constitution of
its own  and in its turn becomes the parent of others  These dependent
villages are in the eastern districts termed  dÃºku   and in the western
or  SÃºnda  districts  chÃ¡ntilan

Every village forms a community within itself  having each its
village officers and priest  whose habitations are as superior to
those of others as their functions are more exalted  To complete the
establishment in most large villages  a temple is appropriated for
religious worship  Here is found that simple form of patriarchal
administration  which so forcibly strikes the imagination of the
civilized inhabitants of this quarter of the world  and which has so
long been the theme of interest and curiosity of those who have visited
the Indian continent

In the larger villages  or chief towns of the subdivisions  in which
the  KÃ¡pala chÃºtag   or division officer  resides  a square place
corresponding with the  Ã¡lun Ã¡lun  of the capital  is reserved
and  in like manner  the mosque is found to occupy one side  and
the dwelling of the chief another  The villages  whether large or
small  are fenced in by strong hedges of  bÃ¡mbu   and other quick
growing plants  All the large towns and capitals are formed on the
same principle  each hut and dwelling being surrounded by a garden
exclusively attached to it  In this respect  they are but large
villages  although usually divided into separate jurisdictions  A
newly formed village contains but a few families  while in the capitals
the population often amounts to several thousand souls   SÃºra kÃ©rta
the capital of the chief native government  though its population is
estimated to exceed one hundred thousand  may be termed an assemblage
or group of numerous villages  rather than what in European countries
would be called a town or city

In the larger towns  however  and in the capitals  considerable
attention is paid to the due preservation of broad streets or roads
crossing in different directions  The inland capitals in the  SÃºnda
districts are distinguished by an extreme neatness and regularity in
this respect  and although both these  and the greater native capitals
at  SÃ³lo  and  YÃºgy a kÃ©rta   may have been laid out principally at the
suggestion of Europeans  it may be observed  that the same conveniences
are also to be found in the extensive capital of  BanyÃºmas   the
planning of which must be ascribed entirely to the natives

The dwelling or palace of the prince is distinguished by the terms
kadÃ¡ton  or  krÃ¡ton   being contractions  the former probably from
ka datu nan   and the latter from  ka ratu nan   the place of the
DÃ¡tu  or  RÃ¡tu   prince   Those of the Regents or  BopÃ¡tis   nobles
entrusted with the government of provinces   are styled  dÃ¡lam   a
term which is applied to the inmost hall or chamber of both buildings
and by which also  particularly in the  SÃºnda  districts  the chiefs
themselves are often distinguished

The  krÃ¡ton   or palace of the prince  is an extensive square
surrounded by a high wall  without which there is generally a moat
or ditch  In the front  and also sometimes in the rear  an extensive
open square is reserved  surrounded by a railing  which is termed the
Ã¡lun Ã¡lun   On the wall of the  krÃ¡ton   which may be considered as
the rampart of a citadel  are usually planted cannon  and within it
the space is divided by various smaller walls  which intersect each
other  and form squares and compartments  each having a particular
designation  and answering a specific purpose  separate quarters being
assigned within the walls to all the families who may be considered
as attached to the person of the sovereign  or that of the princes
The circumference of the wall of the  krÃ¡ton  of  YÃºgy a kÃ©rta  is
not less than three miles  and it was estimated that  at the period
of the assault in 1812  it did not contain fewer than from ten to
fifteen thousand people  That of  SÃºra kÃ©rta  is neither so extensive
nor so well built  After crossing the  Ã¡lun Ã¡lun   or square in front
of the  krÃ¡ton   the principal entrance is by a flight of steps  at
the top of which it is usual for the new sovereign to be invested
with his authority  and on which he is seated on those occasions in
which he shews himself in public  This is termed the  setingel   from
seti ingel   the high ground  On these occasions  the  Pang Ã©rans  and
nobles are ranged below  Proceeding into the interior of the building
and after descending a flight of steps  we find the next principal
gateway or entrance is called the  brÃ³jo nÃ³lo   After passing another
court  the next gateway is termed  kÃ¡mandÃºngan   and beyond this
again is the last passage  distinguished by the term  s rimenÃ¡nti
Still farther on  in the centre of a square  is the hall   mendÃ³po
or  bÃ¡ngsal   of the prince  On one side of the square are two small
mendÃ³pos   or open sheds  called  bÃ¡ngsal peng Ã¡pit   where the
Pang Ã©rans  assemble to wait the appearance of the sovereign in the
principal  mendÃ³po   and on the opposite side is the dwelling  or
Ãºmah tumpang   of the prince  termed  prÃ³bo yÃ³kso   The  bÃ¡ngsal   or
mendÃ³po   is a large open hall  supported by a double row of pillars
and covered with shingles  the interior being richly decorated with
paint and gilding  The ceiling of the  mendÃ³po  of  YÃºgy a kÃ©rta  is
remarkable for its splendour and richness  being composed according
to that peculiar style of architecture frequently observed throughout
Java  in which several squares  of gradually decreasing sizes  are
arranged one above and within the other  a style which is general among
the Hindus  and strongly marks the architecture of the Burmans and
Siamese

In the centre of the  Ã¡lun Ã¡lun   and in front of the  setingel   are
two  wÃ¡ringen  trees  the Indian fig or  banyan    called  wÃ¡ring en
kÃºrung   which have been considered as the sign or mark of the royal
residence from the earliest date of Javan history

In the dwellings of the nobles and governors of provinces  the same
form and order  with some slight modifications  are observed  These
have likewise the  Ã¡lun Ã¡lun  front  The outer entrance corresponding
with the  setÃ­ngel  of the  krÃ¡ton  is however with them denominated
the  lÃ¡wang sekÃ©ting   the second  pasÃ¡dong   and the third  rÃ©gol
within which is the  mendÃ³po   or  dÃ¡lam   The mosque forms one side of
the  Ã¡lun Ã¡lun

The furniture of the houses or huts of the lower orders is very simple
and consists of but few articles  Their bed  as with the Sumatrans  is
a fine mat with a number of pillows  having some party coloured cloths
generally extended over the head  in the form of a canopy or valance
They neither use tables nor chairs  but their meals are brought on
large brass or wooden waiters  with smaller vessels of brass or
china ware for the different articles served up  They sit cross legged
and  in common with other Mahomedans  only use the right hand at their
meals  They usually take up their food between the finger and thumb
and throw it into their month  Spoons are used only for liquids  and
knives and forks very rarely  if at all

In the dwellings of the higher classes  the articles of furniture are
more numerous and expensive  Raised beds  with many pillows piled one
above the other  and mats and carpets  are common in all  but  in the
European provinces  many of the rooms of the chiefs are furnished
with looking glasses  chairs  tables   c  Most of these were at first
introduced for the accommodation of European visitors  but are now
gradually becoming luxuries  in which the chiefs take delight

They are partial to illuminations  and  on days of festivity  ornament
the grounds adjacent to their dwellings with much taste and design  by
working the young shoots of the cocoa nut  the  bÃ¡mbu   and various
flowers  in festoons and other contrivances  The canopy or valance over
the table  bed  or other place selected for any particular purpose  is
universal  This canopy is generally of chintz  from Western India

In all the provinces under the European government  the chiefs have
several rooms fitted up in the European style  for the accommodation of
the officers of government  and none of them hesitate to sit down at
table with their visitors  and join in the entertainment

The natives of Java are in general better clothed than those of Western
India  In many provinces of the interior  and in the elevated parts
of the island  warm clothing is indispensable  They are for the most
part clothed from the produce of their own soil and labour  but there
are parts of their dress which they willingly derive from foreign
countries  Blue cloths and chintzes  in particular  have always
formed an extensive article of importation from Western India  and
the chiefs consume considerable quantities of broadcloths  velvet
and other fabrics  in the jackets  pantaloons  and other articles of
dress  in imitation of Europeans  Persons of condition are particular
in being what they conceive well dressed  A sloven is an object of
ridicule  and  in point of expensive attire  they may be considered as
restricted only by their means  Although the general character of the
native costume is preserved  they seemed inclined to adopt many of the
more convenient parts of the European dress  and  in proof of their
having but few prejudices on this score  it may be observed  that
on occasions when the population of the country has been called out
in the Native Provinces  the assemblage of the provincials presented
themselves habited  many of them in cocked hats and stockings of
Europeans  forming a most grotesque appearance  By the institutions of
the country  a particular kind of dress is assigned to each different
rank  and there are some patterns of cloth  the use of which is
prohibited  except to the royal family  but these sumptuary laws are
for the most part obsolete in the European provinces  and gradually
becoming so in those of the native princes  particularly since those
princes have engaged by treaty to discontinue their enforcement  There
are also distinctions of rank expressed by the different modes of
wearing the krÃ®s  which will be treated of hereafter

It is part of the domestic economy  that the women of the family should
provide the men with the cloths necessary for their apparel  and from
the first consort of the sovereign to the wife of the lowest peasant
the same rule is observed  In every cottage there is a spinning wheel
and loom  and in all ranks a man is accustomed to pride himself on the
beauty of a cloth woven either by his wife  mistress  or daughter

The principal article of dress  common to all classes in the
Archipelago  is the cloth or  sÃ¡rong   which has been described by Mr
Marsden to be  not unlike a Scots highlander s plaid in appearance
being a piece of party coloured cloth  about six or eight feet long
and three or four feet wide  sewed together at the ends  forming  as
some writers have described it  a wide sack without a bottom   With
the  MalÃ¡yus   the  sÃ¡rong  is either worn slung over the shoulders
as a sash  or tucked round the waist and descending to the ankles  so
as to enclose the legs like a petticoat  The patterns in use among
the  MalÃ¡yus  or  BÃºgis  are universally Tartan  but besides these
the Javans pride themselves in a great variety of others  the common
people only wearing the Tartan pattern  while others prefer the Javan
bÃ¡tek  or painted cloths  On occasions of state they wear  in lieu of
the  sÃ¡rong  or  jÃ¡rit  43   the ordinary cloth of the country  which
differs from the  sÃ¡rong  in not being united at the ends   a cloth
termed  dÃ³dot   which is made either of cotton or silk and much larger
This is worn in the same way  but from its size  and the manner of its
being tucked up  it falls in a kind of drapery  which is peculiar to
Java

The men of the lowest class generally wear a pair of coarse short
drawers  reaching towards the knee  with the  jÃ¡rit  or cloth folded
round the waist  and descending below the knees like a short petticoat
This cloth is always tucked up close round the waist  while the
labourer is at work or moving abroad  but loosened  and allowed to
descend to its full length  when in the presence of a superior  It
is fastened round the waist by a narrow waistband or belt   sÃ¡buk
In general  the Javans are also provided with a jacket   kalÃ¡mbi
having short sleeves reaching to the elbows  This is either white
or more frequently of light and dark blue stripes  A handkerchief
or the   Ã­kat   is always folded round the head  With the  MalÃ¡yus
this handkerchief is generally of the Tartan pattern  but among the
Javans it is of the  bÃ¡tek  cloth  and put on more in the manner of
a turban than the handkerchief of a  MalÃ¡yu  is  the crown of the
head is covered with it  and the ends are tucked in  While abroad
they generally wear over it a large hat of leaves or of the split and
plaited bambu  which shelters them like an umbrella from the sun and
rain  A coarse handkerchief is usually tucked into the waistband  or
a small bag is suspended from it  containing tobacco   sÃ­ri    c  The
kris  or dagger  which is universally worn by all classes  completes
the dress  To that of the labourer  according to the work he may be
employed upon  is superadded a large knife or hatchet for cutting wood
brushwood  or grass

The women  in like manner  wear the cloth tucked round their loins
and descending in the form of a petticoat as low as the ankles  It is
folded somewhat differently from the cloth worn by the men  and never
tucked up as with them  The waistband or girdle by which they fasten
it  is termed  Ãºdat   Round the body  passed above the bosom and close
under the arms  descending to the waistband  is rolled a body cloth
called  kÃ©mban   They also commonly wear a loose gown reaching to the
knees  with long sleeves buttoning at the wrists  This gown is almost
invariably blue  never being of any variegated pattern  and as well as
the jacket of the men is usually termed  kalÃ¡mbi   The women do not
wear any handkerchief on their head  which is ornamented by their hair
fastened up in a  glung  or knot  and by an appendage of large studs
either of buffalo horn or brass  which they use for ear rings  Both
men and women  even of the lowest class  wear rings on their fingers
Those worn by the men are either of iron  brass  or copper  those of
the women of brass or copper only  The value of a man s dress  as above
described  may be estimated at about five rupees  twelve and sixpence
and that of the women at about six rupees  or fifteen shillings

The children of the lower orders go naked  from the age of fifteen or
eighteen months to six or seven years  but the children of persons of
condition always wear the  jÃ¡rit  round their loins  together with a
jacket

The higher orders wear a  jÃ¡rit   of about seven or eight cubits long
and about three cubits wide  which with the men is folded once round
the loins  and allowed to descend to the ankles in the form of a
petticoat  but so as to admit of the leg being occasionally exposed
when set forward in the act of walking  The part which is folded in
front commonly hangs somewhat lower than the rest of the garment  The
sÃ¡buk  or waistband is generally of silk of the  chÃ­ndi  or  patÃ³lÃ©
pattern  When at leisure within doors  the men usually wear a loose
cotton gown descending as low as the knees  but when abroad  or in
attendance on public service  they for the most part wear a jacket of
broad cloth  silk  or velvet if procurable  frequently edged with lace
and ornamented with filagree buttons  This jacket is called  sÃ­kapan
from  sikap  ready  as it intimates  when worn  that the party is
ready for duty  The jacket used by the Regents or chiefs of provinces
and other officers of distinction  closely resembles the old Friesland
jacket  as worn about two centuries ago  and is probably modified
if not entirely taken from it  Under the jacket the men always wear
a vest  usually of fine white cloth  with a single row of filagree
buttons  buttoning close to the body and at the neck like a shirt  If
the party is upon a journey or without doors in the sun  the  tÃºdang
or shade  which is usually of broad cloth or velvet  is fixed over
the face  having much the appearance of a large jockey cap  The petty
chiefs  particularly in the western districts  instead of this shade
wear a large hat  in the form of a wash hand bason reversed  made of
split bambu of various colours  and highly varnished to throw off the
rain  This is fastened by a string under the chin  in the same manner
as the hat of the common people

The dress of the women of the higher classes does not in fashion differ
essentially from that of the lower orders  but the articles are of
finer texture and better quality  and gold studs and rings  ornamented
with coloured and precious stones  are substituted for those of copper
and brass  Both men and women of condition wear sandals  shoes  or
slippers in the house  and in the European districts  the Regent and
other chiefs  when in attendance on the public officers  on journeys or
otherwise  usually superadd to the native dress tight cloth or nankeen
pantaloons  with boots and spurs  according to the European fashion

It is difficult to estimate with precision the value of the dress of
the higher orders  That of an ordinary petty chief and his wife costs
about fifty Spanish dollars  or between twelve and thirteen pounds
sterling  including the  siri  box  which is a necessary appendage  The
siri  box of the man is termed  epok   that of the woman  chepÃºri

Neither men nor women cut their hair  but allow it to grow to its
natural length  in this they differ from the  MalÃ¡yus  and  BÃºgis
who always wear it short  The men  except on particular occasions
gather it up on the crown of the head  twist it round  and fasten it
by means of a semicircular tortoise shell comb fixed in front  but
among the higher classes  it is considered a mark of the greatest
respect to let it flow in curls in the presence of a superior  The
princes and chiefs at the native courts usually confine it on the
neck  and allow it to descend down the back in large curls  but in
ChÃ©ribon  and the  SÃºnda  districts  the chiefs  on occasions of
ceremony  let their locks flow in curls and ringlets loose over their
shoulders  The women confine their hair by gathering and twisting it
into one large  glÃºng  or knot at the back of the head  in the manner
of performing which there are several modes  distinguished by as many
names  The short down encircling the forehead is sometimes cut or
shaved  to give the brow a better defined appearance  when the hair
is combed back  and on particular occasions the fine hair in the same
place  which is too short to be combed back and gathered in the knot
is turned in small curls like a fringe  All classes  both of men and
women  apply oils to their hair  The women frequently use scents in
dressing it  and on state days ornament it with a great variety of
flowers  diamond headed pins  and other jewellery  Both sexes perfume
their persons with different species of fragrant oils  as the  lÃ¡ng a
chandÃ¡na   sandal wood oil    lÃ¡ng a kanÃ¡ng a    lÃ¡ng a gÃ¡ru    lÃ¡ng a
gandapÃºra   and  lÃ¡ng a jerÃº   and adorn the skin with a variety of
powders called  bÃ³rÃ©   as the  bÃ³rÃ© kÃºning   yellow powder    bÃ³rÃ©
Ã©rang   black    borÃ© sÃ¡rÃ­   and  borÃ© k lambak   To these may be added
the general use of musk  termed by them  dÃ©des   In the houses of the
higher orders   dÃºpa  or incense of benjamin  and other odoriferous
gums  is generally burnt

The priests generally dress in white  and imitate the turbans of the
Arabs

Such is the ordinary costume of the bulk of the population  as it is
usually seen in all that part of the island peculiarly called Java
In the western or  SÃºnda  districts  the common people are by no means
so well supplied with articles of dress as in the eastern  They are
often seen with little or no covering  beyond a piece of very coarse
cloth tied round the waist  The Regents or chiefs of provinces in these
districts generally wear  when on public duty with the officers of the
European government  a velvet cap ornamented with gold lace  differing
in fashion in each province  but usually calculated to shade the face
from the direct rays of the sun  In the eastern districts the chiefs
on similar occasions  wear the cap called  kÃºluk   which will be more
particularly mentioned as part of the court dress

Besides what may be thus termed the ordinary dress  two grand
distinctions are noticed in the costume of the Javans  these are the
war dress and the court dress  The former consists of  chelÃ¡na  or
pantaloons  buttoned from the hip down to the ankles  the  kÃ¡tok
short kilt or petticoat of coloured silk or fine cotton  descending
just below the knee  and the  Ã¡mben  or girth  rolled tightly round
the body seven or eight times  like a military sash  and securing the
whole body from below the arms to the hips  this is made either of silk
or very fine cotton  Over this is drawn a tight vest without buttons
termed  sÃ¡ngsang   and over this again the ordinary vest or  kÃ³tan
with buttons  buttoning close round the body and neck  the  sÃ­kapan
or jacket being worn over the whole  The  tÃºdung   or shade for the
face  is usually worn on this occasion  as well as shoes or sandals
The  ang ger  or sword belt  which goes round the waist  also forms
an essential part of the war dress  in which the  pedÃ¡ng  or sword is
suspended on the left side  Three  krÃ­ses  are usually worn in the
waist on these occasions  one on each side and the other behind  These
consist of the  krÃ­s  which the wearer particularly calls his own  the
krÃ­s  which has descended to him from his ancestors  and the  krÃ­s
which he may have received on his marriage from his wife s father  The
latter is often placed on the left side for immediate use  This dress
is worn in going into the field of battle  on which occasion it is the
custom to appear in the richest attire their means admit  and to wear
the rings and the other valuable jewels or trinkets which they possess

In the court or full dress  the shoulders  arms  and body  down to
the waist  are entirely bare  the drapery descending from the loins
downwards   chelÃ¡na   and what may be worn on the head  being the only
covering  When a subject  whatever be his rank or family  approaches
his prince  he must wear  chelÃ¡na  or pantaloons of coloured silk or of
fine cotton  without buttons  and instead of the  jÃ¡rit  or ordinary
cloth  he must wear the  dÃ³dot   a cloth which is of nearly double the
dimensions  This is put on  however  nearly in the same manner as the
jÃ¡rit   but so as not to descend on the right side further than just
below the knee  while on the left it falls in a rich drapery  until it
touches the ground in a point  The  sÃ¡buk  or waistband must be of gold
lace  the fringed ends of which usually hang down a few inches  and the
party must only wear one  krÃ­s   which is tucked in the waistband on
the right side behind  while on the left he wears a weapon  or rather
implement  called a  wÃ©dung   in the shape of a chopper  together with
a small knife  indicative of his readiness to cut down trees and grass
at the order of his sovereign  On his head he must wear a peculiar kind
of cap   kuluk    said to have been introduced by the Sultan  PÃ¡jang
in imitation of the scull cap of the Arabs  it is made of cloth
and either white or light blue  stiffened with rich starch  on more
ordinary occasions  and generally  except in full dress  the chiefs
prefer a cap of the same form made of black velvet  ornamented with
gold  and sometimes a diamond on the crown  The part of the body which
is left uncovered is generally rubbed over with white or yellow powder
The sovereign himself is usually habited in the same manner on state
occasions  his body and arms being covered with a bright yellow powder
When women approach the sovereign  besides having their hair ornamented
with diamonds and flowers  they must wear a  sÃ©mbong  or sash round
the waist  which generally is of yellow silk with red at the two ends
It is brought once round the body from behind  and the long ends are
allowed to descend towards the ground  one over each hip

Since the loss of the  makÃ³ta   or golden crown of  MajapÃ¡hit
which disappeared on the banishment of  SusÃºnan MangkÃºrat   both the
SusÃºnan  and  Sultan   on public occasions  when they have to meet the
European authorities  wear a velvet hat or cap of a particular fashion
somewhat different at each court  that of the  SusÃºnan  resembling
what is distinguished by the term of the MadÃºra hat in consequence
of its being still worn by the MadÃºra family  and that of the Sultan
having a golden  garÃºda  affixed at the back  and two wings of gold
extending from behind the ears  They both wear breeches  stockings  and
buckles  after the European fashion

The  jÃ¡mang  or golden plate  which was worn over the forehead  as well
as a variety of golden ornaments round the neck and arms  and which
formerly formed the most splendid part of the costume  are now disused
except at marriages  or in dramatic or other entertainments  when
the ancient costume of the country is exhibited in all its rich and
gorgeous variety

The following picture of a Javan beauty  taken from one of the most
popular poems of the country  will serve better than any description
of mine  to place before the reader the standard of female elegance
and perfection in the island  and to convey an accurate idea of the
personal decorations on nuptial occasions  in dances and dramatic
exhibitions  it will at the same time afford a representation of
what may be considered to have formed the full dress of a female of
distinction  before the innovations of Mahometanism and the partial
introduction of the European fashions  The extravagant genius of
eastern poetry may perhaps be best employed in portraying such
fantastic images  or celebrating such extraordinary tastes

Her face was fair and bright as the moon  and it expressed all that
was lovely  The beauty of  RÃ¡den PÃºtri  far excelled even that of the
widadÃ¡ri DÃ©wi RÃ¡ti   she shone bright even in the dark  and she was
without defect or blemish

So clear and striking was her brightness  that it flashed to the sky
as she was gazed at  the lustre of the sun was even dimmed in her
presence  for she seemed to have stolen from him his refulgence  So
much did she excel in beauty  that it is impossible to describe it

Her shape and form were nothing wanting  and her hair when loosened
hung down to her feet  waving in dark curls  the short front hairs
were turned with regularity as a fringe  her forehead resembling the
chendÃ¡na  stone  Her eyebrows were like two leaves of the  Ã­mbo  tree
the outer angle of the eye acute and slightly extended  the ball of the
eye full  and the upper eyelash slightly curling upwards

Tears seemed floating in her eye  but started not  Her nose was sharp
and pointed  her teeth black as the  kÃ³mbang   her lips the colour
of the newly cut  mangÃºstin  shell  Her teeth regular and brilliant
her cheeks in shape like the fruit of the  dÃºren   the lower part of
the cheek slightly protruding  Her ears in beauty like the  giÃ¡nti
flowers  and her neck like unto the young and graceful  gÃ¡dung  leaf

Her shoulders even  like the balance of golden scales  her chest open
and full  her breasts like ivory  perfectly round and inclining to each
other  Her arms ductile as a bow  her fingers long and pliant  and
tapering like thorns of the forest  Her nails like pearls  her skin
bright yellow  her waist formed like the  pÃ¡tram  when drawn from its
sheath  her hips as the reversed  lÃ­mas  leaf

Like unto the  pÃºdak  flower when hanging down its head  was the shape
of her leg  her foot flat with the ground  her gait gentle and majestic
like that of the elephant  Thus beautiful in person  she was clothed
with a  chÃ­ndi patÃ³la  of a green colour  fastened round the waist
with a golden  lÃºlut  or cestus  her outer garment being of the  mÃ©ga
mendÃºng  dark clouded   pattern  Her  kÃ©mban  upper garment   was of
the pattern  jing gomosi   edged with lace of gold  on her finger she
wore a ring  the production of the sea  and her ear rings were of the
pattern  nÃ³to brÃ³ngto

On the front of the ear studs were displayed the beauties of the
segÃ¡ra mÃºnchar  pattern   emeralds encircled by rubies and diamonds
and she bound up her hair in the first fashion  fastening it with the
glÃºng  knot  bobokÃ³ran   and decorating it with the green  chÃ¡mpaca
flower  and also with the  gÃ¡mbir  melÃ¡ti   and  mÃ­nor  flowers  and in
the centre of it she fixed a golden pin  with a red jewel on the top
and a golden flower ornamented with emeralds  Her necklace was composed
of seven kinds of precious stones  and most brilliant to behold  and
she was highly perfumed  without it being possible to discover from
whence the scent was produced

Her  jÃ¡mang  tiara or head ornament   was of the fashion  sÃ³do sÃ¡ler
and richly chased  her bracelets were of the pattern  glang kÃ¡na   and
suited the  jÃ¡mang   Thus was the beauty of her person heightened and
adorned by the splendour of her dress



To this we may add  from one of the popular versions of the work called
JÃ¡ya LangkÃ¡rÃ¡  the notions which the Javans have of the virtues
beauties  and dress  that should adorn a young man of family

In a youth of noble birth there are seven points which should strike
the observer  and these are indispensable  In the first place
he should be of good descent  in the second  he should possess
understanding  in the third  he should know how to conduct himself
In the fourth place  he recollects what he learns in the  sÃ¡stras
in the fifth  his views must be enlarged  in the sixth  he must
be religious  in the seventh  he must exert the qualifications he
possesses unhesitatingly  These are the seven points which must strike
the immediate attention of the observer

In his heart and mind he must be quiet and tranquil  He should be able
to repress his inclinations  and to be silent when necessary  never
should he on any account tell a falsehood  He should not think long
concerning property  neither should he fear death  in his devotions he
should be free from pride  and he should relieve the distressed

It should be observed by all  that whatever he undertakes is quickly
executed  He should quietly penetrate other men s thoughts and
intentions  his inquiries should be discreet  intelligent  and active
Whenever he meets with an able man  he should attach himself to him
as a friend  and never leave him till he has drawn all his knowledge
from him  and in whatever he does  his actions should be rather what is
generally approved  than the result of his mere will

As long as he lives he must continue to thirst after more knowledge
and he must constantly guard his own conduct  that men may not say it
is bad  His recollection should be clear and distinct  his speech mild
and gentle  so that people s hearts may be softened  and possessing
these qualifications his dependants may praise him

His appearance and stature should not be deficient  The light of his
countenance should be sweet  like that of  BatÃ¡ra AsmÃ¡ra  the god of
love   when he descends to the earth  When men look upon him  they
should be struck with the idea   how great would he not be in war
In the form of his body no part should be ill shaped  His skin should
be like unto virgin gold before it has undergone the process of fire
his head rather large  his hair straight and long  His eyes watery and
ready to overflow  his brows like the  Ã­mbo  leaf  his eyelash like the
tÃ¡njung  flower  his nose sharp and prominent  with but little hair
above the upper lip  his lips like the newly cut  mangÃºstin  shell  his
teeth as if painted  shining and black like the  kÃ³mbang   his breast
and shoulders wide

A bright circle should irradiate his face and breast  and he should
stand unrivalled  Whatever he says should make an impression on all who
hear him  and his speech should be playful and agreeable

He should wear the  chelÃ¡na chÃ­ndi   with a dark green  dÃ³dot  of the
pattern  gÃ¡dong eng Ãºkup   his sash of golden lace  His  krÃ­s  should
have the sheath of the  sÃ¡trÃ­an  fashion  and the handle should be that
of  tÃºng gÃ¡ksmi   The  sÃºmping  an imitation of flowers or leaves which
hang over the ear   should be of gold  and of the fashion  sÃºreng pÃ¡ti
brave to death    and on his right thumb   palgÃºna   he should at the
same time wear a golden ring



In common with the Sumatrans  and other inhabitants of the Archipelago
and southern part of the peninsula  both sexes of all ranks have
the custom of filing and blackening the teeth  it being considered
as disgraceful to allow them to remain  white like a dog s   The
operation is performed when the children are about eight or nine years
of age  and is a very painful one  The object is to make the front
teeth concave  and by filing away the enamel  to render them better
adapted for receiving the black dye  This extraordinary and barbarous
custom tends to destroy the teeth at an early age  and with the use
of tobacco   sÃ­ri   and lime  which are continually chewed  generally
greatly disfigures the mouth  The Javans  however  do not file away
the teeth so much as is usual with some of the other islanders  nor do
they set them in gold  as is the case with the Sumatrans  Neither do
they distend the lobe of the ear  to that enormous extent practised
on  BÃ¡li  and elsewhere  and which is observed in the representations
of  BÃºdh   This has been discontinued since the introduction of
Mahomedanism

Compared with the western Asiatics  the Javans have but few prejudices
regarding food  They are Mahomedans  and consequently abstain rigidly
from swine s flesh  and commonly from inebriating liquors  and some
few families  from the remains of a superstition which has descended
to them from their Hindu ancestors  will not eat of the flesh of the
bull or cow  but with these exceptions  there are few articles which
come amiss to them  They live principally upon vegetable food  and
rice is on Java  what it is throughout Asia  the chief article of
subsistence  but fish  flesh  and fowl are likewise daily served up at
their meals  according to the circumstances of the parties  With fish
they are abundantly supplied  and what cannot be consumed while fresh
is salted  or dried  and conveyed into the inland provinces  They do
not eat of the turtle or other amphibious animals  but none of the fish
known to Europeans are objected to by them  The flesh of the buffalo
the ox  the deer  the goat  and various kinds of poultry  are daily
exposed for sale in their markets  and are of very general consumption
The flesh of the horse is also highly esteemed by the common people
but the killing of horses for food is generally prohibited  except when
maimed or diseased  The hide of the buffalo is cut into slices  soaked
and fried as a favourite dish  The flesh of the deer  dried and smoked
is well known throughout the Malayan Archipelago  under the term
dinding   and is an article in high request on Java

The dairy forms no part of domestic economy of Java  neither milk
itself  nor any preparation from it  being prized or used by the
natives  a circumstance very remarkable  considering that they were
undoubtedly Hindus at one period of their history  and that  if so
essential an article of food had once been introduced  it is probable
it would always have been cherished  No good reason seems to be
assigned for their indifference to milk  except perhaps the essential
one  that the cows of Java afford but a very scanty supply of that
secretion  The udder of a Javan cow is sometimes not larger than
that of a sheep  and seems to afford but a bare subsistence for the
calf  yet the buffalo gives a larger quantity  and butter or  ghee
might equally be prepared from it  The cows of the Indian breed are
distinguished by a hump between the shoulders and a larger udder  and
it has been found that the secretion of milk can be increased  as it
is observed that where particular care has been taken by Europeans
even of the Javan cows  they have in a short time afforded double the
usual quantity  It has been conjectured  that on the introduction of
the Indian breed by the Hindu colonists  the use of milk was forbidden
in order that the number of cattle might more rapidly increase  but
the Javans have no tradition to this effect  It is however remarkable
that an absolute aversion to this aliment exists on that part of the
continent of Asia  in which many popular usages are found similar
to those of the east insular nations  In a recent publication it is
stated of the people between Siam and China  who are not  by the bye
very nice in what they eat   qu ils ne se permettent pas le lait des
animaux  et qu ils ont pour cette boisson la rÃ©pugnance que peut
inspirer la boisson du sang  Cette rÃ©pugnance va mÃªme jusqu Ã  exclure
du nombre de ses alimens le beurre et le fromage 44

Salt is obtained in abundance throughout every part of the island
but being manufactured on the coast  is proportionally higher in
price in the inland districts  The sugar used by the natives is not
prepared from the sugar cane  but from the Ã¡ren and other palms  It
is manufactured by the simple process of boiling down the  tÃ¡ri   or
liquor which exudes from these trees  which are tapped for the purpose

None of the palms of Java furnish the worms which are employed for food
in other eastern countries  but similar worms are found in various
kinds of  rÃ³tan    sÃ³lak    c  which are considered as dainties  not
only by the natives  but by the Chinese and by some Europeans  they are
called  gÃ©ndon   Worms of various species  but all equally esteemed as
articles of food  are found in the teak and other trees  White ants  in
their different states  are one of the most common articles of food in
particular districts  they are collected in different ways  and sold
generally in the public markets  Their extensive nests are opened to
take out the chrysalis  or they are watched  and swarms of the perfect
insect are conducted into basins or trays containing a little water
where they soon perish  they are called  lÃ¡ron

The cooking utensils are  as might be supposed  of the most simple
kind  and either of coarse pottery or copper  Rice  after several
poundings in a trough or mortar  is generally dressed by steam  though
not unfrequently boiled in a small quantity of water  In the former
case  it is remarkable for its whiteness and consistency when dressed
and in this state it is publicly exposed for sale in the markets and
along the high roads  Indian corn is usually roasted in the ear  and
offered for sale in the same manner  Other aliments are for the most
part prepared in the manner of curry  termed by the  MalÃ¡yus gulai
of these they have almost an endless variety  distinguished according
to the principal ingredients  Besides what may be considered as the
principal dishes  they excel in a variety of preparations of pastry and
sweetmeats  particularly of the  kÃ©tan    of which many are by no means
unpleasant to an European palate  They are fond of colouring their
pastry  as well as other articles of their food  They occasionally make
their rice yellow and brown  and even turn their boiled eggs red for
variety

Black pepper  as among the  MalÃ¡yus   is scarcely ever used  on account
of its supposed heating quality  The most common seasoning employed
to give a relish to their insipid food  is the  lombok   triturated
with salt  it is called  sÃ¡mbel   both by the  MalÃ¡yus  and Javans
and this condiment is indispensable and universal  It is of different
kinds  according to the substances added to increase or diversify its
strength or pungency  the most common addition is  trÃ¡si   denominated
by the  MalÃ¡yus  blÃ¡chang   The name  lÃ¡lab  is given to various leaves
and kernels  mostly eaten raw with rice and  sÃ¡mbel   many of these
substances possess a pungency and odour intolerable to Europeans
If several vegetables are mixed together  and prepared by boiling
they constitute what is called  jang an   or greens for the table
of which there are several distinctions  The various legumes are of
great importance in the diet of the natives   PadomÃ³ro    pin dang
and  semÃºr   are dishes to which the flesh of the buffalo or fowls
is added  and which resemble the Indian curry   RÃºjak  is prepared
from unripe mangos and other fruits  which  being grated  receive the
addition of capsicum and other spices  and thus constitutes a favourite
dish with the natives  though very disagreeable to Europeans

The Chinese prepare from the  gÃ©delÃ©  a species of soy  somewhat
inferior to that brought from Japan  The  kÃ¡chang iju  is highly useful
as a general article of diet  and is a good substitute for various
legumes  which form the common nourishment of the continental Indians
it contains much farinaceous matter   TrÃ¡si  or  blÃ¡chang  is prepared
in many situations along the northern coast  but is mostly required for
the consumption of the interior  It is prepared from prawns or shrimps
and extensive fisheries for the purpose are established in many parts
of the coast  The shrimps being taken  are strewed with salt  and
exposed to the sun till dry  they are then pounded in wooden mortars
dressed  and formed into masses resembling large cheeses  in this state
they constitute an article of trade  and are distributed through the
country  The putrescent fluid remaining after the expression strongly
impregnated with the odour of the shrimps  is evaporated to the
consistence of a jelly  and affords a favourite sauce called  pÃ©tis
An inferior kind of  trÃ¡si  is prepared from small fish  and  when made
into the form of small balls  is called  blÃ©nyek  TrÃ¡si blÃºro  is of a
reddish colour  and much esteemed at the native capitals  Another kind
of  pÃ©tis  is prepared from the flesh of the buffalo  chiefly in the
interior districts

Salted eggs are also an important article in the diet of the Javans
The eggs of ducks being most abundant  are chiefly preserved in this
way  The eggs are enveloped in a thick covering made of a mixture of
salt and ashes in equal parts  or salt and pounded bricks  and being
wrapped each in a large leaf  they are placed on one another in a tub
or large earthen vessel  In ten days they are fit for use  but they are
generally kept longer in the mixture  and  being thoroughly impregnated
with salt  can be kept many months  In some districts  the eggs of the
Muscovy duck are particularly employed for the purpose

In preparing their food  the Javans may be considered to observe the
same degree of cleanliness which is usual with Asiatics in general  and
in point of indulgence of appetite  they may be  perhaps  placed about
midway between the abstemious Hindu and the unscrupulous Chinese  In
a country where vegetation is luxuriant  and cultivation is already
considerably advanced  it follows that there must be an abundant supply
for a people who subsist principally on vegetable productions  and
it may be asserted  that  except where the manifest oppressions of
government  or the effects of civil discord  for the moment deprive
the labourer of his just reward  there are few countries where the
mass of the population are so well fed as on Java  There are few of
the natives who cannot obtain their  kÃ¡ti   or pound and a quarter of
rice a day  with fish  greens  and salt  if not other articles  to
season their meal  Where rice is less abundant  its place is supplied
by maize or Indian corn  or the variety of beans which are cultivated
and even should a family be driven into the woods  they would still be
able to obtain a bare subsistence from the numerous nutritious roots
shoots  and leaves  with which the forests abound  Famine is unknown
and although partial failures of the crop may occur  they are seldom
so extensive as to be generally felt by the whole community  Thus
abundantly supplied  the Javans seem by no means inclined to reject the
bounties of Providence  they are always willing to partake of a hearty
meal  and seldom have occasion to make a scanty one  Yet among them
a glutton is a term of reproach  and to be notoriously fond of good
living is sufficient to attach this epithet to any one

The Javans  except where respect to Europeans dictates a different
practice  eat their meals off the ground  A mat kept for the purpose
is laid on the floor  which  when the meal is over  is again carefully
rolled up  with the same regularity as the table cloth in Europe  and
a plate of rice being served up to each person present  the whole
family or party sit down to partake of the meal in a social manner  A
principal dish  containing the  sÃ¡mbel    jÃ¡ngan   or other more highly
seasoned preparation  is then handed round  or placed in the centre of
the company  from which each person adds what he thinks proper to the
allowance of rice before him

Water is the principal and almost exclusive beverage  and  among
people of condition  it is invariably boiled first  and generally drunk
warm  Some are in the habit of flavouring the water with cinnamon and
other spices  but tea  when it can be procured  is drunk by all classes
at intervals during the day

On occasions of festivals and parties  when many of the chiefs
are assembled  the dishes are extremely numerous and crowded  and
hospitality being a virtue which the Javans carry almost to an
excess  due care is taken that the dependants and retainers are
also duly provided for  These  particularly in the highlands of the
SÃºnda  districts  where the people are furthest removed from foreign
intercourse  and the native manners are consequently better preserved
are arranged in rows at intervals  according to their respective ranks
the first in order sitting at the bottom of the hall  and the lowest
at some distance without  where each is carefully supplied with a
bountiful proportion of the feast  thus exhibiting  in the mountainous
districts of Java  an example of rude hospitality  and union of the
different gradations of society in the same company  similar to that
which prevailed in the Highlands of Scotland some centuries ago
where  it is said   those of inferior description were  nevertheless
considered as guests  and had their share  both of the entertainment
and of the good cheer of the day

It is at these parties that the chiefs sometimes indulge in
intoxicating liquors  but the practice is not general  and the use of
wine  which has been introduced among them by the Dutch  is in most
instances rather resorted to from respect to Europeans  than from any
attachment to the bottle

The Javans have universally two meals in the day  one just before noon
and one between seven and eight o clock in the evening  the former
which is the principal meal  corresponding with the European dinner
and distinguished by the term  mÃ¡ngÃ¡n Ã¡wan   or the day meal  the
latter  termed  mÃ¡ngÃ¡n wÃ©ngÃ©   or evening meal  They have no regular
meal corresponding with the European breakfast  but those who go abroad
early in the morning  usually partake of a basin of coffee and some
rice cakes before they quit their homes  or purchase something of the
kind at one of the numerous  wÃ¡rongs   or stalls  which line the public
roads  and are to the common people as so many coffee or eating houses
would be to the European  rice  coffee  cakes  boiled rice  soups
ready dressed meats and vegetables  being at all times exposed in them
What is thus taken by the Javans in the morning to break the fast  is
considered as a whet  and termed sarap

By the custom of the country  good food and lodging are ordered to be
provided for all strangers and travellers arriving at a village  and
in no country are the rights of hospitality more strictly enjoined
by institutions  or more conscientiously and religiously observed
by custom and practice   It is not sufficient   say the Javan
institutions   that a man should place good food before his guest
he is bound to do more  he should render the meal palatable by kind
words and treatment  to soothe him after his journey  and to make his
heart glad while he partakes of the refreshment   This is called  bÃ³jo
krÃ³mo   or real hospitality

The chewing of betel leaf   sÃ­ri    and the areka nut   pÃ­nang    as
well as of tobacco   tambÃ¡ko    and  gÃ¡mbir   is common to all classes
The  sÃ­ri  and  pÃ­nang  are used much in the same manner as by the
natives of India in general  These stimulants are considered nearly as
essential to their comfort  as salt is among Europeans  The commonest
labourer contrives to procure at least tobacco  and generally  sÃ­ri
and if he cannot afford a  sÃ­ri  box  a small supply will be usually
found in the corner of his handkerchief  Cardamums and cloves compose
part of the articles in the sÃ­ri box of a person of condition

The inhabitants of Java  as a nation  must be accounted sober  although
Europeans  in order to serve their own purposes  by inducing some
of the chiefs to drink wine to excess  have succeeded  to a certain
extent  in corrupting the habits of some individuals in this respect
Two kinds of fermented liquor are however prepared by the Javans
called  bÃ¡dek  and  brÃ³m   the former from rice  the latter almost
exclusively from  kÃ©tan  or glutinous rice  In making  bÃ¡dek   the rice
previously boiled is stewed with a ferment called  rÃ¡gi   consisting
of onions  black pepper  and capsicum  and mixed up into small cakes
which are daily sold in the markets  After frequent stirring  the
mixture is rolled into balls  which are piled upon each other in a
high earthen vessel  and when fermentation has commenced the  bÃ¡dek
exudes and is collected at the bottom  The remaining rice  strongly
impregnated with the odour of fermentation  has a sweetish taste  and
is daily offered for sale in the markets as a dainty  under the name
of  tapÃ©    BÃ¡dek  is  in comparison with  brÃ³m   a simple liquor
producing only slight intoxication  it is often administered to
children to dislodge worms from the intestines  In making  brÃ³m   the
kÃ©tan  is boiled in large quantities  and being stewed with  rÃ¡gi
remains exposed in open tubs till fermentation takes place  when the
liquor is poured off into close earthen vessels  It is generally buried
in the earth for several months  by which the process of fermentation
is checked and the strength of the liquor increased  sometimes it is
concentrated by boiling  The colour is brown  red  or yellow  according
to the kind of  kÃ©tan  employed   BrÃ³m   which has been preserved for
several years  is highly esteemed among the natives  constituting a
powerful spirit  which causes violent intoxication followed by severe
head ache in persons not accustomed to its use  The substance that
remains after separation is a deadly poison to fowls  dogs  and various
other animals  Arrack is prepared by distillation  an inferior kind
made in a more simple and economical manner  is called  chiu   Both
are prepared by the Chinese  and a particular account of the method
employed will be found under another head 45   A kind of small beer
is made at  SÃºra kÃ©rta  in a mode similar to the European process of
brewing  by exciting fermentation in a solution of Javan sugar  with
several spices and the leaves of the  pÃ¡ri  instead of hops  When
fresh  the liquor is sprightly  and not unpleasant to the taste  but it
cannot be preserved longer than four or five days

The use of opium  it must be confessed and lamented  has struck deep
into the habits  and extended its malignant influence to the morals
of the people  and is likely to perpetuate its power in degrading
their character and enervating their energies  as long as the European
government  overlooking every consideration of policy and humanity
shall allow a paltry addition to their finances to outweigh all regard
to the ultimate happiness and prosperity of the country  It is either
eaten in its crude state as  mÃ¡nta   or smoked as  mÃ¡dat  or  chÃ¡ndu
In the preparation of  mÃ¡dat   the crude opium is boiled down with
the leaves of tobacco   sÃ­ri   or the like  and used in a sticky or
somewhat liquid state  In  chÃ¡ndu   the opium is merely boiled down
without any admixture  to a still thicker consistency  and rolled into
small balls or pills  in which state  when dry  they are inserted
into  bÃ¡mbus   and thus smoked  The crude opium is eaten principally
by the people in the interior of the country  in the provinces of
the native princes  the opium prepared for smoking is used along the
coast  and generally in the other islands of the Archipelago  it is
prepared by the Chinese  The use of opium  however  though carried
to a considerable extent  is still reckoned disgraceful  and persons
addicted to it are looked upon as abandoned characters  and despised
accordingly  The effects of this poison on the human frame are so
well described by the Dutch commissioners who sat at the Hague in
1803  and who much to their honour declared   that no consideration
of pecuniary advantage ought to weigh with the European government in
allowing its use   that together with the opinion of Mr  Hogendorp
who concurred with them  I shall insert their statement here  The wish
to do justice to authorities  whose views were so creditable to their
country and their own character  and the importance of their opinion to
an extensive population  will plead an apology for the length of the
extract which I now present

The opium trade   observe the Commissioners   requires likewise
attention  The English in Bengal have assumed an exclusive right to
collect the same  and they dispose of a considerable number of chests
containing that article annually at Calcutta by public auction  It
is much in demand on the Malay coast  at Sumatra  Java  and all
the islands towards the east and north  and particularly in China
although the use thereof is confined to the lower classes  The effect
which it produces on the constitution is different  and depends on
the quantity that is taken  or on other circumstances  If used with
moderation  it causes a pleasant  yet always somewhat intoxicating
sensation  which absorbs all care and anxiety  If a large quantity
is taken  it produces a kind of madness  of which the effects are
dreadful  especially when the mind is troubled by jealousy  or inflamed
with a desire of vengeance or other violent passions  At all times it
leaves a slow poison  which undermines the faculty of the soul and
the constitution of the body  and renders a person unfit for all kind
of labour and an image of the brute creation  The use of opium is so
much more dangerous  because a person who is once addicted to it can
never leave it off  To satisfy that inclination  he will sacrifice
every thing  his own welfare  the subsistence of his wife and children
and neglect his work  Poverty is the natural consequence  and then it
becomes indifferent to him by what means he may content his insatiable
desire after opium  so that  at last  he no longer respects either the
property or life of his fellow creature

If here we were to follow the dictates of our own heart only  and what
moral doctrine and humanity prescribe  no law  however severe  could
be contrived  which we would not propose  to prevent at least that in
future  no subjects of this Republic  or of the Asiatic possessions of
the state  should be disgraced by trading in that abominable poison
Yet we consider this as absolutely impracticable at present with
respect to those places not subject to the state  Opium is one of the
most profitable articles of eastern commerce  as such it is considered
by our merchants  and if the navigation to those parts is opened to
them  which the interest of the state forcibly urges   it is impossible
to oppose trading in the same  In this situation of affairs  therefore
we are rather to advise  that general leave be given to import opium at
Malacca  and to allow the exportation from thence to Borneo and all the
eastern parts  not  in the possession of the state

Opium   says Mr  Hogendorp   is a slow though certain poison  which
the Company  in order to gain money  sells to the poor Javans  Any one
who is once enslaved to it  cannot  it is true  give it up without
great difficulty  and if its use were entirely prohibited  some few
persons would probably die for want of it  who would otherwise languish
on a little longer  but how many would by that means be saved for
the future  Most of the crimes  particularly murders  that are now
committed  may be imputed to opium as the original cause

Large sums of money are every year carried out of the country in
exchange for it  and enrich our competitors  the English  Much of
it is smuggled into the interior  which adds to the evil  In short
the trade in opium is one of the most injurious and most shameful
things which disgrace the present government of India  It is therefore
necessary at once  and entirely  to abolish the trade and importation
of opium  and to prohibit the same  under the severest penalties that
the law permits  since it is a poison  The smuggling of it will then
become almost impracticable  and the health  and even the lives of
thousands  will be preserved  The money alone which will remain in the
country in lieu of it  is more valuable as being in circulation  than
the profit which the Company now derives from the sale of it

This measure will excite no discontent among the Javans  for the
princes and regents  with very few exceptions  do not consume any
opium  but  as well as the most respectable of their subjects  look
upon it as disgraceful  The use of opium is even adduced as an
accusation of bad conduct  and considered as sufficient cause for the
removal or banishment of a petty chief

36  The Javan mode of taking account of population is by the number
of chÃ¡cha  or  families   as it is usually rendered  though the word
strictly means  enumeration   When the sovereign assigns lands  it is
not usual for him to express the extent of land  but the number of
chÃ¡cha attached to it  But as the population of the land so granted
varies  the original expression becomes inaccurate  In the native
provinces  the number of chÃ¡chas reckoned is almost invariably less
than the number actually existing  a clear proof  if the original
census was correct  that in those provinces population has increased
An account of the number of chÃ¡chas was taken some few years back by
the Sultan of YÃºgya kÃ©rta  with a view to a new distribution of the
lands  but the measure was very unpopular  and no accurate results
were obtained  The Dutch relied entirely upon this loose system of
enumeration

37  This includes the Population of  PachÃ­tan   under the European
government  amounting to about 22 000

38  This does not include the dependent islands  on which a
considerable portion of the population is scattered

42  It is remarked in the text  that the condition of the slaves
on Java is very different from that of the same class in the West
Indies  The former are employed rather as administering to the luxuries
than the necessities of their proprietors  and  with few exceptions
exclusively for domestic purposes  There are some who having taught
their slaves when young to embroider  or exercise some useful
handicraft or trade  obtain a livelihood by means of their services
and some few employ their slaves on their estates  or let them out
to hire  but the general condition of the slaves is that of domestic
servants

The regulations and colonial statutes respecting slavery seem to
have been framed on the principles of humanity  and with attention
to the genius of the Christian religion  yet  in consequence of
the supplementary force of the Roman law in the Dutch system of
legislature  there appeared to be one capital defect in the code
viz   that a slave was considered as a real property  incapable of
personal rights  from which consideration the ill treatment of a
master towards his slave was not so much estimated on the principle
of personal injury  as that of a proprietor abusing his own property
and although a slave  under such a system  might obtain a portion of
property for himself with the consent of his master  his possession was
always precarious  and depended on the discretion of his proprietor  in
the same manner as a  peculium adventitium  with the Romans   becoming
only the unlimited property of the slave  if the master allowed him to
keep it after his emancipation

It was conceived  that considering the civil law only as a supplement
to the positive law  continued in force on Java under the proclamation
of the Earl of Minto of 11th September 1811  the code respecting
slavery might  together with the other parts of legislation  be amended
and established  on principles more consistent with humanity and good
sense  by a declaration  that slaves in future should not be considered
as objects of real property  but as objects possessing personal rights
and bound only to unlimited service  and that  in consequence thereof
slaves should never be transferred from one master to another  without
their own consent given before witnesses or a notary  That a master
should possess no other power over his slave  than to exact service in
an equitable manner  that he should inflict no corporal chastisement on
him after he had attained a certain age  nor beyond such a degree as
would be given to his children or common apprentices  that all personal
wrongs done to a slave  either by his master or by others  should be
estimated by the common rules of personal injuries  and not by the
principle of a proprietor abusing his own property  that the punishment
for murder committed by a master on his slave  should be the same as
that of murder committed on a free person  that every slave should
have a right to acquire property of his own  by his private industry
or labour  or by the bounty of others  that this property should never
be removeable at the discretion of the master  that by this property
the slave should always have a right to redeem his liberty  after
having continued with his master for the term of seven years  and on
paying the sum which  on estimation  subject to the approval of the
magistrate  should at the time be thought an adequate equivalent for
his personal services

These fundamental alterations in the code were submitted by the local
government to a higher authority  at a period when the principal
proprietors evinced a concurrence in the measure  but the provisional
tenure of the government  and the expectation of the early transfer of
the island to the crown  induced a delay  until the re establishment of
Holland as a kingdom precluded the adoption of so essential a change

The excuse offered by the colonists for the origin and continuance of
slavery on Java is  that on the first establishment of the Dutch in the
Eastern Islands  there did not exist  as in Western India  a class of
people calculated for domestic service  that they had  in consequence
to create a class of domestic servants  in doing which they adopted the
plan of rearing children in their families from other countries  in
preference to those in their immediate neighbourhood  who  from their
connexions and the habits of their relatives  could never be depended
upon  Whether necessity dictated this system in the earlier periods
of the Dutch establishment  or not  is at least doubtful  but it is
certain that this necessity no longer exists  nor is there the shadow
of an excuse for continuing on Java this odious traffic and condition
The Javans  during the residence of the British on Java  have been
found perfectly trustworthy  faithful  and industrious  and the demand
was alone wanting in this  as in most cases  to create a sufficient
supply of competent domestics  The continuance of the traffic for one
day longer serves but to lower the European in the eyes of the native
who  gratified with the measures adopted by the British government in
its suppression  stands himself pure of the foul sin  To the credit
of the Javan character  and the honour of the individual  it should
be known  that when the proclamation of the British government was
published  requiring the registration of all slaves  and declaring
that such as were not registered by a certain day should be entitled
to their emancipation  the PanÃ¡mbahan of SÃºmenap  who had inherited
in his family domestic slaves to the number of not less than fifty
proudly said   Then I will not register my slaves  they shall be free
hitherto they have been kept such  because it was the custom  and the
Dutch liked to be attended by slaves when they visited the palace
but as that is not the case with the British  they shall cease to be
slaves  for long have I felt shame  and my blood has run cold  when I
have reflected on what I once saw at Batavia and SemÃ¡rang  where human
beings were exposed for public sale  placed on a table  and examined
like sheep and oxen

The short administration of the British government on Java has
fortunately given rise to another class of domestic servants  The
numerous officers of the army  and others whose funds did not admit
or whose temporary residence did not require a permanent establishment
of servants  for the most part usually took Javans into their service
and though these might in the first instance  not be so well acquainted
with European habits  as slaves who had been brought up from their
infancy in Dutch families  yet they gradually improved  and were
in the end  for the most part very generally preferred  Let not
therefore  necessity be again urged as a plea for continuing the
traffic

The measures actually adopted by the British government may be summed
up in a few words  The importation was  in the first instance
restricted within a limited age  and the duty on importation doubled
An annual registry of all slaves above a certain age was taken  and
slaves not registered within a certain time declared free  A fee of one
Spanish dollar was demanded for the registry of each slave  the amount
of which constituted a fund for the relief of widows and orphans  On
the promulgation of the act of the British legislature  declaring
the further traffic in slaves to be felony  that act  with all its
provisions  was at once made a colonial law  Masters were precluded
from sending their slaves to be confined in jail at their pleasure  as
had hitherto been the case  and all committals were required to be made
through the magistrates  in the same manner as in the case of other
offenders

These general regulations  with the more rigid enforcement of the
prohibition of further importations  and of such parts of the code
of regulations for ameliorating the condition of the slaves as had
become obsolete  were all to which the local government felt itself
competent  but it gave its sanction to an institution set on foot by
the English  and joined in by many of the Dutch inhabitants  which took
for its basis the principles of the African Institution  and directed
its immediate care to a provision for the numerous slaves restored to
liberty

The island of Java is a great agricultural country  its soil is
the grand source of its wealth  In its cultivation the inhabitants
exert their chief industry  and upon its produce they rely  not only
for their subsistence  but the few articles of foreign luxury or
convenience which they purchase  The Javans are a nation of husbandmen
and exhibit that simple structure of society incident to such a stage
of its progress  To the crop the mechanic looks immediately for his
wages  the soldier for his pay  the magistrate for his salary  the
priest for his stipend  or  jÃ¡kat    and the government for its
tribute  The wealth of a province or village is measured by the extent
and fertility of its land  its facilities for rice irrigation  and the
number of its buffaloes

When government wishes to raise supplies from particular districts  it
does not enquire how many rupees or dollars it can yield in taxes  but
what contribution of rice or maize it can furnish  and the impost is
assessed accordingly  the officer of revenue becomes a surveyor of land
or a measurer of produce  and the fruits of the harvest are brought
immediately into the ways and means of the treasury  When a chief gives
his assistance in the police or the magistracy  he is paid by so much
village land  or the rent of so much land realized in produce  and a
native prince has no other means of pensioning a favourite or rewarding
a useful servant   Be it known to the high officers of my palace
to my  BopÃ¡tis   regents   and to my  MÃ¡ntris  petite noblesse
says a Javan patent of nobility granted by Sultan  HamÃ¡ngku BÃºana
that I have given this letter to my servant to raise him from the
earth  bestowing upon him  for his subsistence  lands to the amount of
eleven hundred  chÃ¡chas   the labour of eleven hundred men   By the
population returns  and by the number of leases granted under the late
settlement  it appears  that sometimes there is not more than a tenth
part of the inhabitants employed in any other branch of industry  Out
of a population of 243 268 in the  PriÃ¡ng en  regencies  209 125 are
stated as employed in agriculture  In  SurabÃ¡ya   the proportion of
householders who are cultivators  is to the rest of the inhabitants as
32 618 to 634  in  SemÃ¡rang   as 58 206 to 21 404  in  Rembang  it is
as 103 230 to 55 300  and in other districts there are considerable
variations  but it rarely happens  that the people employed in trade
in manufactures  in handicrafts  or other avocations  amount to a half
of those engaged in agriculture  or a third of the whole population
The proportion  on an average  may be stated as three and a half or
four to one  In England  it is well known  the ratio is reversed  its
agricultural population being to its general population as one to
three or two and a half  By the surveys lately made under the orders
of the British government  we are enabled to describe the processes
of Javan agriculture  and to state its results with more accuracy and
in greater detail  than can be attained on many subjects of superior
public interest  If we avail ourselves of these means pretty largely
it is not so much in the hope of increasing the stock of agricultural
knowledge  as of assisting the reader to form an estimate of the
character  habits  wants  and resources of the Javan

The soil of Java  though in many parts much neglected  is remarkable
for the abundance and variety of its productions  With very little
care or exertion on the part of the cultivator  it yields all that
the wants of the island demand  and is capable of supplying resources
far above any thing that the indolence or ignorance of the people
either oppressed under the despotism of their own sovereigns  or
harassed by the rapacity of strangers  have yet permitted them to
enjoy  Lying under a tropical sun  it produces  as before observed
all the fruits of a tropical climate  while  in many districts  its
mountains and eminences make up for the difference of latitude  and
give it  though only a few degrees from the line  all the advantages
of temperate regions  The  bÃ¡mbu   the cocoa nut tree  the sugar cane
the cotton tree  and the coffee plant  here flourish in the greatest
luxuriance  and yield products of the best quality  Rice  the great
staple of subsistence  covers the slopes of mountains and the low
fields  and gives a return of thirty  forty  or fifty fold  while
maize  or even wheat and rye  and the other plants of Europe  may be
cultivated to advantage on high and inland situations  Such is the
fertility of the soil  that in some places after yielding two  and
sometimes three crops in the year  it is not necessary even to change
the culture  Water  which is so much wanted  and which is seldom found
in requisite abundance in tropical regions  here flows in the greatest
plenty  The cultivator who has prepared his  sÃ¡wah   or rice field
within its reach  diverts part of it from its channel  spreads it out
into numerous canals of irrigation  and thus procures from it  under
a scorching sun  the verdure of the rainy season  and in due time a
plentiful harvest  Nothing can be conceived more beautiful to the
eye  or more gratifying to the imagination  than the prospect of the
rich variety of hill and dale  of rich plantations and fruit trees or
forests  of natural streams and artificial currents  which presents
itself to the eye in several of the eastern and middle provinces  at
some distance from the coast  In some parts of  KedÃº    BanyumÃ¡s
SemÃ¡rang    PasÃºruan   and  MÃ¡lang   it is difficult to say whether
the admirer of landscape  or the cultivator of the ground  will be most
gratified by the view  The whole country  as seen from mountains of
considerable elevation  appears a rich  diversified  and well watered
garden  animated with villages  interspersed with the most luxuriant
fields  and covered with the freshest verdure

Over far the greater part  seven eighths of the island  the soil is
either entirely neglected or badly cultivated  and the population
scanty  It is by the produce of the remaining eighth that the whole
of the nation is supported  and it is probable that  if it were all
under cultivation  no area of land of the same extent  in any other
quarter of the globe  could exceed it  either in quantity  variety  or
value of its vegetable productions  The kind of husbandry in different
districts  as shall be mentioned afterwards more particularly  depends
upon the nature and elevation of the ground  and the facilities for
natural or artificial irrigation  The best lands are those situated in
the vallies of the higher districts  or on the slopes of mountains
and on the plains stretching from them  as such lands are continually
enriched with accessions of new earth washed down from the hills by
the periodical rains  The poorest soil is that found on the ranges
of low hills  termed  kÃ©ndang   extending along many districts  and
particularly in the southern division of the island  but in no part is
it so sterile or ungrateful  as not to afford a liberal return for the
labour bestowed upon its cultivation  especially if a supply of water
can be by any means directed upon it

But when nature does much for a country  its inhabitants are sometimes
contented to do little  and  satisfied with its common gifts  neglect
to improve them into the means of dignity or comfort  The peasantry
of Java  easily procuring the necessaries of life  seldom aim at
improvement of their condition  Rice is the principal food of all
classes of the people  and the great staple of their agriculture
Of this necessary article  it is calculated that a labourer can  in
ordinary circumstances  earn from four to five  kÃ¡tis  a day  and a
kÃ¡ti  being equivalent to one pound and a quarter avoirdupois  is
reckoned a sufficient allowance for the daily subsistence of an adult
in these regions  The labour of the women on Java is estimated almost
as highly as that of the men  and thus a married couple can maintain
eight or ten persons  and as a family seldom exceeds half that number
they have commonly half of their earnings applicable for the purchase
of little comforts  for implements of agriculture  for clothing and
lodging  The two last articles cannot be expensive in a country where
the children generally go naked  and where the simplest structure
possible is sufficient to afford the requisite protection against the
elements

The price of rice  which thus becomes of importance to the labourer
varies in different parts of the island  according to the fertility
of the district where it is produced  its situation with regard to a
market  or its distance from one of the numerous provincial capitals
As the means of transport  by which the abundance of one district
might be conveyed to supply the deficiencies of another  and to
equalize the distribution of the general stock  are few and laborious
this variation of price is sometimes very considerable  even in the
same district there are great variations  according to the nature
of the crop  In the Native Provinces  a  pÃ­kul   weighing 133  lbs
English  sometimes sells below the fourth part of a Spanish dollar  and
at other times for more than two Spanish dollars  but in common years
and at an average over the whole island  including the capital  the
estimate may be taken at thirty Spanish dollars the  kÃ³yan  of thirty
pÃ­kuls   or three thousand  kÃºtis   A  kÃºti  of rice  according to
this estimate  may be sold to the consumer  after allowing a sufficient
profit to the retail merchant  for much less than a penny

But though the price of this common article of subsistence may be of
some consequence to the Javan labourer  when he wants to make any
purchase with his surplus portion  he is rendered independent of the
fluctuations of the market for his necessary food  by the mode in
which he procures it  He is generally the cultivator of the soil  and
while he admits that law of custom  which assigns to the superior a
certain share of the produce  he claims an equal right himself to the
remainder  which is generally sufficient to support himself and his
family  and he sometimes finds in this law of custom  sanctioned by the
interest of both parties  a security in the possession of his lands
and a barrier against the arbitrary exactions of his chief  which could
scarcely be expected under the capricious despotism of a Mahomedan
government  In addition to this reserved share  he raises on his own
account  if he is industrious  within what may be termed the cottage
farm  all the vegetables  fruit  and poultry requisite for his own
consumption  His wife invariably manufactures the slight articles of
clothing  which  in such a climate  the common people are in the habit
of wearing  What can be spared of the fruits of their joint industry
from the supply of their immediate wants  is carried to market  and
exchanged for a little salt fish  dried meat  or for other trifling
comforts  hoarded as a store for the purchase of an ox or a buffalo  or
expended in procuring materials for repairing the hut and mending the
implements of husbandry

The farming stock of the cultivator is as limited as his wants are
few and his cottage inartificial  it usually consists of a pair of
buffaloes or oxen  and a few rude implements of husbandry  There is
a small proportion of sheep and goats on the island  but  with the
exception of poultry  no kind of live stock is reared exclusively
either for the butcher or the dairy  By the returns made in 1813 of
the stock and cattle of the provinces under the British government
containing a population of nearly two millions and a half  it was found
that there were only about five thousand sheep and twenty four thousand
goats  The number of buffaloes  by the same return  and in the same
space  was stated at 402 054  and of oxen at 122 691  Horses abound in
the island  but are principally employed about the capitals  and not in
husbandry  further than in the transport of produce from one district
to another

The buffalo and ox are used for ploughing  The former is of a smaller
size than the buffalo of Sumatra and the Peninsula  though larger than
that of Bengal and of the islands lying eastward of Java  It is a
strong tractable animal  capable of long and continued exertion  but it
cannot bear the heat of the mid day sun  It is shy of Europeans  but
submits to be managed by the smallest child of the family in which it
is domesticated  The buffalo is either black or white  the former is
larger and generally considered superior  In the  SÃºnda   or western
and mountainous districts  nine out of ten are white  which is not at
all the case in the low countries  no essential difference in the breed
has been discovered to be connected with this remarkable distinction of
colour  The usual price of a buffalo in the western districts is about
twenty four rupees for the black  and twenty rupees for the white  in
the eastern districts the price varies from twelve to sixteen rupees
The  SÃºnda  term for a buffalo is  mÃºnding   the Javan   mÃ¡isa  and
kÃ©bo   and in compliment to  LalÃ©an   the prince who is supposed to
have introduced cultivation into the  SÃºnda  districts  that prince
and his successors on the  SÃºnda  throne are distinguished by the
appellation  MÃºnding  or  MÃ¡isa   The name of the individual sovereigns
enters into a compound with these general terms for the dynasty  and
they are called  MÃ¡isa lalÃ©an    MÃºnding sÃ¡ri   and so of others

The ox of Java derives its origin from the Indian breed  Two varieties
are common  that which is called the Javan ox has considerably
degenerated  the other  which is termed the Bengal or Surat ox  is
distinguished by a lump on the shoulder  and retains in his superior
strength other traces of his origin  The bull after castration is used
as a beast of burden  for the draught  and sometimes for the stall
Cows are chiefly employed in husbandry  and are particularly useful
to the poorer class  but in the  sÃ¡wah  and the extensive inundated
plantations of the low districts of the island  the superior bulk and
strength of the buffalo is indispensable  Eastward of  PasÃºruan
however  the lands are ploughed by oxen and cows exclusively  The
wild breed  termed  bÃ¡ntÃ©ng   is found principally in the forests of
that quarter and in  BÃ¡li   although it occurs also in other parts  a
remarkable change takes place in the appearance of this animal after
castration  the colour in a few months invariably becoming red

The cows on Java  as well as throughout the Archipelago  remarkably
degenerate from those properties  for which  in a state of
domestication  they are chiefly prized in other quarters of the world
and afford little or no milk beyond what is barely sufficient for the
nourishment of the calf  but the draught ox does not partake of a
similar change  and in the central and eastern districts  particularly
where the pasture is good  becomes a strong active animal  The
degenerate domestic cows are sometimes driven into the forests  to
couple with the wild  bÃ¡ntÃ©ng   for the sake of improving the breed
A single pair of oxen  or buffaloes  is found sufficient for the yoke
both of the plough and harrow  and these form by far the most expensive
part of the cultivator s stock  The price of a draught ox  in the
central and eastern districts  in which they are more generally used
in agriculture  varies from eight to sixteen rupees  or from twenty to
forty shillings English  and a cow may be purchased for about the same
price  Either from the luxuriance of the pasture  the greater care of
the husbandmen  or a more equal climate  both the buffalo and the ox
are usually in better condition on Java than in many parts of India
indeed  those miserable half starved looking animals  with which some
of the provinces of Bengal abound  are never seen in this island
except  perhaps  occasionally  in some of the few herds belonging to
Europeans  in the vicinity of Batavia

Buffaloes  however  more than other domestic animals  are subject to
an epidemic disease  the symptoms and nature of which have not been
hitherto carefully noted  or satisfactorily explained  It prevails
throughout the whole island  and generally re appears after an interval
of three  four  or five years  it makes great ravages in the stock of
the peasantry  and is checked in its progress by no remedies which have
hitherto been discovered or applied  it is of an infectious nature
and excites great alarm when it appears  it bears different names in
different parts of the island  As the bull and cow are not liable to
this disease  and as  in addition to this advantage  they are less
expensive in their original purchase  they are preferred by many of the
natives

For draught  the buffalo and cow are employed  and for burden  the
horse  particularly mares  and the ox  In level districts  and in good
roads  the use of the latter is preferred  The usual burden of a horse
is rather less than three hundred weight  and that of an ox rather
more than four  but in mountainous districts  and where the roads are
neglected  one half of this weight is considered as a sufficient  if
not an excessive load

The comparatively higher price of cattle on Java than in Bengal has
been accounted for from the demand for them as food  and the absence of
extensive commons on which to feed them

When implements of husbandry are mentioned in British agriculture  many
expensive instruments  and complicated machinery suggest themselves
to those acquainted with its practical details  From the preparation
of the ground for receiving the seed  till the grain comes into the
hands of the miller  labour is economized and produce increased  by
many ingenious processes and artful contrivances  of which a Javan
could form no conception  He could form no idea of the fabrication or
advantages of our different kinds of ploughs  of our swing ploughs
our wheel ploughs  and our two furrow ploughs  of our grubbers
cultivators  and other instruments for pulverizing the soil  of our
threshing and winnowing machines  and other inventions  A plough of
the simplest construction  a harrow  or rather rake  and sometimes a
roller  with a  pÃ¡chul   or hoe  which answers the purpose of a spade
an  Ã¡rit   which serves as a knife or small hatchet  and the  Ã¡ni Ã¡ni
a peculiar instrument used by the reapers  are all the implements
employed by him in husbandry  and the total cost of the whole does not
exceed three or four rupees  or from seven to ten shillings

The plough   walÃºku    in general use for the irrigated land  consists
of three parts  the body  beam  and handle  It is generally made of
teak wood  where that material can be provided  or otherwise of the
most durable that can be found  the yoke only is of  bÃ¡mbu   Simple as
it is  it appears  both in its construction and durability  superior
to the plough of Bengal  as described by Mr  Colebrooke  from which it
differs  in having a board cut out of the piece which forms the body
for throwing the earth aside  The point of the body  or sock  is tipped
with iron  which in some districts is cast for the purpose  There is
another kind  of more simple construction  in use for dry and mountain
cultivation  this is termed  brÃºjul   and consists of but two parts
Both kinds are so light  that when the ploughman has performed his
morning s work  he throws the plough over his shoulder  and without
feeling any inconvenience or fatigue  returns with it to his cottage
For gardens  and for small fields adjoining the villages  the small
lÃºku chÃ­na   or Chinese plough  is used with one buffalo  the cost for
a good plough seldom exceeds a rupee and a half  The harrow   gÃ¡ru
which is rather a large rake having only a single rough row of teeth
costs about the same sum  and is in like manner made of teak where
procurable  except the handle  beam  and yoke  which are of  bÃ¡mbu
When used  the person who guides it generally sits upon it  to give it
the necessary pressure for levelling or pulverizing the soil

The  pÃ¡chul  is a large hoe  which in Java serves every purpose of the
spade in Europe  and is consequently  next to the plough  the most
important implement in Javan husbandry  The head is of wood tipped
with iron  and the handle  which is about two feet and a half long
frequently has a slight curve  which renders it more convenient for
use  its price is about half a rupee  The  Ã¡rit   or weeding knife
costs about eight pence  and the  Ã¡ni Ã¡ni   with which the grain
is reaped  about three pence  The latter is a small instrument of
peculiar shape  The reaper holds it in a particular manner  and crops
off with it each separate ear  along with a few inches of the straw
This mode of reaping has been immemorially practised and is universally
followed  Some of the most intelligent people being questioned
respecting the origin of this operose process  answered  that it was
reported to have been established in ancient times as a  s lÃ¡mat   or
grateful acknowledgment for an abundant harvest  that when his field
was covered with the bounty of Ceres  no reaper could refuse her this
acknowledgment  and that the religious discharge of this obligation was
guarded by the belief  that if he ceased to offer this tribute of his
labour at the season of harvest  the field would not continue to yield
him the same abundant return

The lands are ploughed  harrowed  and weeded by the men  who
also conduct the whole process of irrigation  but the labour of
transplanting  reaping  and  where cattle are not used for the purpose
of transporting the different crops from the field to the village  or
from the village to the market  devolves upon the women

Besides the two general divisions of the year  marked out by nature
in the great changes of the earth and the atmosphere  there are other
periodical distinctions  depending on less obvious or more irregular
phenomena  These variations have been ascertained by a reference
to the course of the heavenly bodies  or the calculations of the
wÃºku   which are described in another part of this work  It is the
office of the village priest to keep this reckoning  and to apprize
the cultivators when the term approaches for the commencement of the
different operations of husbandry  Of these minor seasons of the
year  the first  commencing after the rice harvest which falls in
August or September  lasts forty one days  During this season the
leaves fall from the trees  vegetation is interrupted  and the only
field labour performed is the burning of grass and vegetables  as a
preparation of the  tÃ©gal  or  gÃ¡gas   In the second season  which
lasts twenty five days  vegetation again resumes its vigour  The
third  which lasts twenty four days  is considered the most proper for
planting sweet potatoes  yams  and such other vegetables as usually
form the second crop  the wild flowers of the forest are now in
blossom  and the period of what is termed dry cultivation commences
The fourth  which lasts also twenty four days  is the natural season
for the pairing of wild animals  high winds now prevail  the rains
descend  and the rivers begin to rise  During the fifth  which lasts
twenty six days  the implements of husbandry are prepared  and the
water courses examined and renewed  this is the commencement of the
wet cultivation  In the sixth season the ploughing of the  sÃ¡wahs
and sowing of the  bÃ­bÃ­t  for the great rice crop takes place  this
season lasts forty one days  In the seventh  which also lasts forty one
days   pÃ¡ri  is transplanted into fields  and the courses of the water
properly directed  In the eighth  which lasts twenty six days  the
plants shoot above the water and begin to blossom  In the ninth season
which consists of twenty five days  the ears of the grain form  In the
tenth  also consisting of twenty five days  they ripen and turn yellow
The eleventh  which lasts twenty six days  is the period for reaping
and in the twelfth  which consists of forty one days  the harvest
is completed  the produce gathered in  and that dry clear weather
prevails  in which the days are the hottest and the nights the coldest
of the whole year  The accurate assignment of the number of days by the
natives themselves to the different operations of husbandry  affords
such complete information on this interesting subject  that any further
account would be superfluous  It may  however  be proper to observe
that the periods above described chiefly refer to the progress of the
principal rice crop  as influenced by the annual rains  but there are
many lands rendered quite independent of these rains  by the vicinity
of streams which afford a plentiful supply of water at all times of the
year  In many favoured situations  it is even common to observe at one
view the rice fields in almost every stage of their cultivation  in
one  women engaged in planting the newly prepared soil  and in another
the reapers employed in collecting the fruits of the harvest

Lands in Java are classed under two general divisions  lands which are
capable of being inundated directly from streams or rivers  and lands
which are not so  The former are termed  sÃ¡wah   the latter  tÃ©gal
or  gÃ¡ga   It is on the  sÃ¡wahs  that the great rice cultivation
is carried on  and these admit of a subdivision  according to the
manner in which the land is irrigated  Those which can be irrigated
at pleasure from adjacent springs or rivers  are considered as the
proper  sÃ¡wah   those which depend on the periodical rains for the
whole or principal part of the water by which they are fertilized
are termed  sÃ¡wah tÃ¡dahan   The former are by far the most valuable
and lands of this description admit of two heavy crops annually
without regard to any particular time of the year  the fields seldom
exceed forty or sixty feet in breadth  and the water is retained in
them by means of a small embankment of about a foot in height  On the
slopes of the mountains  where this mode of cultivation is chiefly
found  these fields are carried gradually above each other in so many
terraces  for the purpose of irrigation  the water admitted in the
upper terrace inundating each of them in its descent  The  tÃ©gal  lands
are appropriated to the culture of less important crops  such as the
mountain rice  Indian corn   c

The vast superiority of the  sÃ¡wah   or wet cultivation  over that
of  tÃ©gal   or dry  is shewn in their relative produce  and may be
still further illustrated by a comparison of the rents which the two
descriptions of land are calculated to afford  The quantity of  tÃ©gal
land  or land fit for maize  as compared with that of  sÃ¡wah  land
varies in different districts  In  ChÃ©ribon   the  tÃ©gal  land  by
the late survey  amounted only to 2 511  while the  sÃ¡wan  exceeded
16 000  In  TÃ©gal  the proportions were even more widely varied  the
number of  jungs  of the former to the latter being as 891 to 11 445
In  SurabÃ¡ya  they were as 1 356 to 17 397  in  KedÃº  and  BesÃºki  they
were nearly equal  being respectively as 8 295 to 10 757  and as 6 369
to 7 862

The succession of crops  next to the facility of irrigation  depends
upon the quality of the soil  which in the native provinces is divided
by the cultivators into three principal kinds   tÃ¡na lÃ¡du    tÃ¡na
lÃ­nchad   and  tÃ¡na pÃ¡sir   The first is the best  consisting of
rich vegetable mould  and a certain proportion of sand  and exists
chiefly near the banks of large rivers  the second is almost pure
clay  and is found in the central plains  and the third is alluvial
and covers the maritime districts  The term  pÃ¡das pÃ©rÃ©ng  is applied
to the oblique tracts enriched with a fertile mould  which form the
acclivities of hills  and from which the water readily disappears
TÃ¡na lÃ¡du  will bear a constant succession of crops   TÃ¡na lÃ­nchad
yields only a single annual crop of rice  during the rainy season the
soil constitutes a stiff mud  in which the plants find the requisite
moisture and display all their luxuriance  when it is afterwards
exposed to the rays of the sun  it bursts into extensive fissures
which admitting the scorching heat by which they were produced  become
detrimental to every species of vegetation

Besides the annual crop of rice which is raised on the  sÃ¡wah  lands
a variety of plants are raised upon them as a second or light crop
within the same year  Among these are several species of  kÃ¡chang  or
bean  the cotton plant  the indigo  and a variety of cucumbers   c
But the more generally useful and profitable vegetables require nearly
the same period as the rice  and only yield their increase once in a
season  they mostly grow in situations  on which the supply of water
can be regulated  and a continued inundation prevented  Among the
most important are the  gÃºdÃ©    kÃ¡chang pÃ©nden   or  kÃ¡chang chÃ­na
kÃ¡chang Ã­ju    kÃ©dÃ©le    jÃ¡gung  or Indian corn   jÃ¡gung chÃ¡ntel
jÃ¡wa wÃºt    jÃ¡li    wÃ­jen    jÃ¡rak  or palma christi   tÃ©rong   and
kÃ©ntang jÃ¡wa

In  tÃ©gal  lands of high situations a particular method of planting is
sometimes practiced  which produces a result similar to a succession
of crops  Together with the rice are deposited the seeds of other
vegetables  which arrive at maturity at different periods  chiefly
after the rice harvest  The most common and useful among these is
cotton  and  in some tracts  great quantities of this valuable product
is thus obtained  without any exclusive allotment of the soil  Next to
this are various leguminous and other plants  which do not interfere
with the rice  No less than six or eight kinds of vegetables are
sometimes in this manner seen to shoot up promiscuously in a single
field

Rice  however  as has been repeatedly observed  is the grand staple
of Javan  as well as Indian cultivation  and to this every other
species of husbandry is subordinate  The adjacent islands and states
of Sumatra  Malacca  Borneo  Celebes  and the Moluccas  have always in
a great measure depended on the Javan cultivator for their supply
and the Dutch were in the habit of transporting an annual quantity of
between six and eight thousand tons to Ceylon  to Coromandel  to the
Cape  and their other settlements  Even at the low rate at which it
generally sells  a revenue of near four million of rupees  or about
half a million sterling  has been estimated as the government portion
of its annual produce

According to the modes of cultivation by which it has been reared  this
grain is called  pÃ¡ri sÃ¡wah   or  pÃ¡ri gÃ¡ga   corresponding  with some
exceptions  to the  pÃ¡di sÃ¡wah   and  pÃ¡di lÃ¡dang  of Sumatra  In the
western  and particularly the  SÃºnda  districts  the term  gÃ¡ga  is
changed for  tÃ­par   the term  gÃ¡ga   in these districts  being only
occasionally applied to the grain which is cultivated on newly cleared
mountainous spots

The lowland and the mountain rice  or more correctly speaking  the
rice raised in dry lands and the rice raised in lands subjected to
inundation  are varieties of the same species  the oriza sativa of
LinnÃ¦us  although both of them are permanent  but the rice planted
on the mountainous or dry ground does not thrive on irrigated lands
nor  on the contrary  does the  sÃ¡wah  rice succeed on lands beyond
the reach of irrigation  The mountain rice is supposed to contain in
the same bulk more nourishment than the other  and is more palatable
but its use is limited to the less populous districts of the island
the greater proportion of the inhabitants depending exclusively on the
produce of the  sÃ¡wahs   or wet cultivation  for their support

Stavorinus asserts  that the mountain rice is not so good as that
of the low lands  Mr  Marsden informs us  on the contrary  that the
former brings the higher price  and is considered of superior quality
being whiter  heartier  and better flavoured grain  keeping better
and increasing more in boiling   The rice of the low lands   he says
is more prolific from the seed  and subject to less risk in the
culture  and on these accounts  rather than from its superior quality
is in more common use than the former   In general  the weightiest
and whitest grain is preferred  a preference mentioned by Bontius
who includes in the character of the best rice its whiteness  its
clearness of colour  and its preponderating weight  bulk for bulk
Dr  Horsfield conceives that Stavorinus formed his opinion in the
low northern maritime districts of Java  and Mr  Marsden from a more
extensive observation  Many intelligent natives state  that they
prefer the mountain rice when they can procure it  on account of its
whiteness  strength  and flavour  and that they are only limited in
its use  by the impossibility of raising as much of it as can satisfy
the general demand  all the mountain or dry rice not being sufficient
to feed one tenth of the population  In less populous countries  as in
many parts of Sumatra  the inhabitants can easily subsist the whole
of their numbers exclusively on mountain rice  or that produced on
lÃ¡dangs   which are fields reclaimed from ancient forests for the
first time  and from which only one crop is demanded  The grain here
as in the mountain rice of Java  is highly flavoured and nutritious
but in countries where the population is crowded  where a scanty crop
will not suffice  and where a continued supply of new land cannot be
obtained  the peasantry must apply their labour to such grounds as
admit of uninterrupted cultivation  and renew their annual fertility
by periodical inundations  even although the produce is not so highly
prized

In the  sÃ¡wahs  of Java the fields are previously ploughed  inundated
and laboured by animals and hoeing  until the mould is converted into
a semifluid mire  they then are considered fit to receive the young
plants  No manure is ever used  Oil cakes   bÃºngkil    which are by
some writers supposed to be used for this purpose generally  are only
employed in the gardens about Batavia  One of the chief characteristics
of the soil on Java  is an exemption from the necessity of requiring
manure  on the  sÃ¡wah  lands  the annual inundation of the land is
sufficient to renovate its vigour  and to permit constant cropping for
a succession of years  without any observable impoverishment

In the cultivation of the  sÃ¡wahs   the plants are uniformly
transplanted or removed from their first situation  In those of  tÃ©gal
or  gÃ¡ga   they grow to maturity on the same spot where the seed was
originally deposited  whether this be on high mountainous districts
or on low lands  the distinction of  sÃ¡wah  and  gÃ¡ga  depending
exclusively not upon the situation of the field  but in the mode of
culture  whether wet or dry

In raising rice in the  sÃ¡wahs   inundation is indispensable till it is
nearly ripe  The seed is first sown on a bed prepared for the purpose
about one month before the season for transplanting it  and the plant
is during that time termed  bÃ­bit   Two methods are in use  According
to the first  called  Ãºrit   the ears of  pÃ¡ri  are carefully disposed
on the soft mud of the seed bed  in the second  called  ng Ã©ber   the
separated seeds are thrown after the manner of broadcast in Europe  In
by far the greatest portions of the island  the ground is prepared
the seed sown  and the plant removed  during the course of the rainy
season  or between the months of November and March  In situations
where a constant supply of water can be obtained from springs
rivulets  or rivers  two crops are produced in the course of twelve or
fourteen months  but the advantage of double cropping  which exhausts
the soil without allowing it time to recover  has been considered as
very questionable  If in some situations commanding a supply of water
the earth is allowed to rest after the preceding harvest  during the
latter end of the rainy season  and the transplantation made in the
months of June and July  it generally yields more profitable crops than
the common method of working the  sÃ¡wah   This  which is termed  gÃ¡du
by the natives  has been recommended by the experience of European
planters

Irrigation is exclusively effected by conducting the water of rivers
and rivulets from the more or less elevated spots in the vicinity
and in this respect  differs materially in its process from that of
Bengal  for although considerable labour and ingenuity are exercised in
detaining  regulating  and distributing the supply  by means of dams
called  bandÃ¡ng ans   no machinery whatever is employed in raising
water for agricultural purposes in any part of the island

The rice grown on  sÃ¡wahs   is of two kinds   pÃ¡ri gÃ©nja  and  pÃ¡ri
dÃ¡lam   In the former  the harvest takes place four months after the
transplantation  in the latter  six months   PÃ¡ri gÃ©nja  having the
advantage of a quicker growth  is therefore often planted when the
rainy season is far advanced   PÃ¡ri dÃ¡lam  is more prolific  and
yields a grain of superior quality  comprising those varieties in which
the ears are longer and more compound  The varieties of each kind are
distinct and permanent

The subvarieties are very numerous  amounting  with those of  kÃ©tan
to more than a hundred   KÃ©tan  is a distinct variety  with very
glutinous seeds  seldom employed as an article of food  except in
confections  cakes  and the like  Of the varieties of the  pÃ¡ri
gÃ©nsha    mentik  and  anchar bÃ¡ntap  are preferred  Of the  pÃ¡ri
dÃ¡lam   those of  krentÃºlan  and  sÃºka nÃ¡ndi  are most esteemed  being
remarkably well flavoured and fit for keeping   S lÃ¡mat jÃ¡wa  yields
also rice of good quality  The bearded kinds of  pÃ¡ri  are always
preferred for keeping  as the grains do not readily fall off  Near
SÃºra kÃ©rta   the principal native capital  close to the site of the
former capital  KÃ©rta sÃºra   there is a peculiar tract inundated by
water from a fountain at  PÃ­ng gÃ­ng   which is said to produce a grain
of very superior flavour  from which the table of the  SusuhÃºnan
is supplied   SÃºka nÃ¡ndi  is the kind uniformly preferred for these
plantations

For  pÃ¡ri gÃ¡ga   whether in high or low situations  the ground is
prepared by ploughing and harrowing  and the seed is planted after the
manner called setting in some parts of England  The holes are made
by pointed sticks  called  pÃ³nchos   and into each hole two seeds
are thrown  Only careless husbandmen  or those who cannot procure
the requisite assistance in their labour  sow by broadcast  In high
situations the earth is prepared before the rains commence  the seed
is sown in the months of September or October  and the harvest takes
place in January and February following   GÃ¡gas  of low situations are
planted about a month after the harvest of the  sÃ¡wah  is got in  and
frequently receive temporary supplies of water from a neighbouring
rivulet  In high situations  to which water cannot be carried  they are
sufficiently moistened by the first rains of the season  During their
growth  they receive several hoeings from the careful husbandman

As the grain ripens  an elevated shed is frequently erected in the
centre of a plantation  within which a child on the watch touches
from time to time  a series of cords extending from the shed to the
extremities of the field  like the radii of a circle  and by this cheap
contrivance  and an occasional shout  prevents the ravages of birds
which would otherwise prove highly injurious to the crops  These little
elevated sheds in the interior  and particularly in the district of
BÃ¡nyumÃ¡s   are very neatly constructed of matting

The reapers are uniformly paid  by receiving a portion of the crop
which they have reaped  this varies in different parts of the island
from the sixth to the eighth part  depending on the abundance or
scarcity of hands  when the harvest is general through a district
one fifth or one fourth is demanded by the reaper  In opposition to so
exorbitant a claim  the influence of the great is sometimes exerted
and the labourer is obliged to be content with a tenth or a twelfth

The grain is separated from the husk by pounding several times
repeated  The first operation is generally performed in wooden troughs
in the villages near which it grows  and before it is brought to
market  The  pÃ¡ri  being thus converted into  bras  or rice  afterwards
receives repeated poundings  according to the condition or taste of the
consumer

With the exception of the rice raised in  sÃ¡wahs   all other produce
is cultivated on dry grounds  either on the  sÃ¡wah  fields during the
dry season  or on  tÃ©gal  land  at all times exclusively appropriated
to dry cultivation  The principal article next to rice  as affording
food to man  is maize or Indian corn  termed  jÃ¡gung   It is general in
every district of Java  but is more particularly an object of attention
on  MadÃºra   where  for want of mountain streams  the lands do not
in general admit of irrigation  In the more populous parts of Java
likewise  where the  sÃ¡wahs  do not afford a sufficient supply of rice
the inhabitants have lately had recourse to the cultivation of maize
It is now rapidly increasing in those low ranges of hills  which  on
account of the poverty of the soil  had hitherto been neglected  and is
becoming more and more a favourite article of food  In the more eastern
districts  it is procured from the inhabitants of  MadÃºra  in exchange
for rice  It is generally roasted in the ear  and in that state is
exposed while hot for public sale  but it is never reduced to flour  or
stored for any considerable time

The  zea maize   or common  jÃ¡gung   is a hardy plant  and grows on
any soil  In common with every other production of Java it thrives
there most luxuriantly  nor is there any reason to believe  that
the Javan soil is less adapted to it than that of Spanish America
where Humboldt estimates its produce at a hundred and fifty fold  It
is planted in fertile low lands in rotation with rice  and in high
situations without intermission  often forming in the latter the chief
if not the only  support of the inhabitants  There are three different
kinds  distinguished from each other by their respective periods of
ripening  The first kind requires seven months  and is a large rich
grain  the second takes only three  and is of inferior quality  and the
third  which seems valuable only on account of its rapid growth  ripens
in forty days  but has a poor small grain  They may be planted at all
seasons of the year  and of the two inferior kinds  several crops are
often raised from the same ground within the year

Of other cerealia  the  jÃ¡gung chÃ¡ntel  is raised very partially
in particular districts  at no great distance from the capitals of
the interior  and mostly for the purpose of preparing from it  by
fermentation  a liquor sometimes drunk by the natives  as a general
article of food it cannot be enumerated  The  jÃ¡wa wÃºt  and  jÃ¡li
are still more confined in their use  although the natives have a
tradition  that on the first arrival of the Indian colonists on
Java  the former was the only grain found on the island  it yields a
pleasant pulp  and is made into several articles of confectionary  As
a principal article of food  or a substitute for rice  Indian corn can
alone be considered

In times of scarcity  the natives make use of various kinds of the
plantain   musa    also the yam   ubi  of the Malays  and  uwi  of
the Javans   the sweet potatoe   katÃ©lo   convolvulus batatas   the
varieties of which are described in one of the early volumes of the
Batavian Transactions  and a number of leguminous vegetables  the
various kinds of beans   kÃ¡chang    together with a species of grass
with minute yellow seeds  called  tÃºton   which in ancient times is
said to have formed a principal article of food  and the dried leaves
of some other plants  but  happily  these times seldom occur  and the
use of the  jÃ¡gung chÃ¡ntel  and  jÃ¡wa wÃºt   as well as of the various
roots and leguminous vegetables to which I have alluded  is too limited
to produce any sensible effects on the inhabitants  Those natives who
make use of the Indian corn exclusively  inhabit the highest districts
where the purity of the atmosphere counteracts any injury which their
health might otherwise sustain from the want of rice

From the  Ã¡ren   sagurus rumphii   which grows abundantly in many parts
of Java  a substance is prepared  similar in all respects to the true
sago of the Eastern Islands  It is particularly useful in times of
scarcity  when large numbers of these valuable trees are felled  for
the purpose of collecting the pith  The sap yields an excellent sugar
of a dark colour  in common use with the natives  The wine or  tÃºwak
toddy  prepared from it is superior to that obtained from most other
palms

A very agreeable pulp is prepared from the pith of this tree  pounded
with water  and exposed one night to spontaneous evaporation  it is
eaten with palm sugar  and found by no means unpleasant by Europeans
The tuberous roots of a species of curcuma   tÃ©mu lÃ¡wak   grated and
infused in water  yields a similar pulp  Both are denominated  pÃ¡tÃ­
and daily offered for sale along the roads and in the interior

All the varieties of the cocoa tree  noticed on Sumatra  are to be
found on Java  where its quicker and more luxuriant growth is accounted
for by the superiority of soil  The principal varieties of the
cocoa nut are enumerated in one of the early volumes of the Batavian
Transactions

Of the oil giving plants there are many  The  kÃ¡chang gÃ³ring  of the
Malay countries  or  as it is indifferently termed by the Javans
kÃ¡chang chÃ­na    pÃ©nden   or  tÃ¡na   is cultivated almost exclusively
for the purpose of obtaining its oil  near the capitals of the
principal districts  both central and maritime  It requires a very
strong soil for its support  and as the cultivation is profitable
the lands which produce it yield high rents  It is never employed as
an article of food by itself  but what remains of it after the oil is
expressed  forms an ingredient for the seasoning of rice  in one of
the common dishes of the natives  The oil is obtained by grinding the
seeds between two grooved cylinders  and then separating it either
by expression or boiling  The former is chiefly used by the Chinese
and yields as a refuse the oil cakes  which I formerly observed were
employed as manure in some of the gardens near Batavia  Where these
cylinders are not in use  the following mode is adopted  the nut
having been taken from the ground  is dried by exposure to the sun
for a few days  after which the kernel is extracted  and reduced
by successive beatings in the Javan  lÃ©sung  or mortar  to a grain
sufficiently small to pass through a sieve  it is then boiled by steam
and having been allowed to cool for twenty four hours  is put into a
basket  and in that state placed between two oblong planks  which
being joined together at one extremity  are forced to meet at the
other  on the principle of a lemon squeezer  The oil exuding from the
interstices of the basket is caught on an ox s hide  placed below to
convey it to an earthen receiver

The  jÃ¡rak   or palma christi  is cultivated in nearly the same manner
as maize  and thrives on similar soils  from this plant is obtained
most of the oil for burning in lamps  In extracting the oil from this
as well as from the cocoa nut  various processes are employed  most
of which tend to accelerate the rancidity of the oil  A pure cold
drawn oil is not known  In the cocoa nut  if the oil is obtained by
expression  the broken nuts from which it is made are exposed till
putrefaction commences  In other cases they are grated  and water being
poured upon them  the parts mixed with it form  sÃ¡nten   a white milky
fluid  which is evaporated till the oil alone remains  As this process
requires much time and fuel  a more economical method is often resorted
to  the milky fluid is left exposed for a night  when the oily parts
rise to the top  and being separated from the water are purified by a
very short boiling

Of the sugar cane  or according to the native term   tÃ©bu   the name
by which it is designated  not only on Java  but throughout the
Archipelago   there are several varieties  The dark purple cane
which displays the greatest luxuriance  and shoots to the length of
ten feet  is the most highly prized  By the Javans the sugar cane is
only cultivated to be eaten in an unprepared state  as a nourishing
sweetmeat  They are unacquainted with any artificial method of
expressing from it the saccharine juice  and  consequently  with
the first material part of the process by which it is manufactured
into sugar  Satisfied with the nourishment or gratification which
they procure from the plant as nature presents it  they leave the
complicated process to be conducted exclusively by the Chinese

The cane  as in the West Indies  is propagated by cuttings of about a
foot and a half long  which are inserted in the ground in an upright
direction  previously to the setting in of the rains  The Chinese
occasionally use oil cake for enriching the lands  but where the plant
is only raised for consumption in its fresh state  no manure whatever
is thought requisite  and a good soil  without such preparation  will
yield three or four crops in succession

The cane is extensively cultivated for the juice in the vicinity of
Batavia  where there are numerous manufactories  principally owned by
the Chinese  It is also cultivated for this purpose in considerable
tracts at  JÃºpara  and  PasÃºruan   and partially in other districts
of the eastern provinces  where mills are established for expressing
it  Previous to the disturbances in  ChÃ©ribon   sugar likewise was
manufactured in that district in considerable quantities  and furnished
an important article of export

The coffee plant  which is only known on Java by its European
appellation  and its intimate connexion with European despotism  was
first introduced by the Dutch early in the eighteenth century  and
has since formed one of the articles of their exclusive monopoly  The
labour by which it is planted  and its produce collected  is included
among the oppressions or forced services of the natives  and the
delivery of it into the government stores  among the forced deliveries
at inadequate rates  Previously to the year 1808  the cultivation of
coffee was principally confined to the  SÃºnda  districts  There were
but comparatively few plantations in the eastern districts  and the
produce which they were capable of yielding did not amount to one tenth
part of the whole  but  under the administration of Marshal Daendels
this shrub usurped the soil destined for yielding the subsistence of
the people  every other kind of cultivation was made subservient to
it  and the withering effects of a government monopoly extended their
influence indiscriminately throughout every province of the Island

In the  SÃºnda  districts  each family was obliged to take care of
one thousand coffee plants  and in the eastern districts  where new
and extensive plantations were now to be formed  on soils and in
situations in many instances by no means favourable to the cultivation
five hundred plants was the prescribed allotment  No negligence could
be practised in the execution of this duty  the whole operations of
planting  cleaning  and collecting  continued to be conducted under
the immediate superintendance of European officers  who selected the
spot on which new gardens were to be laid out  took care that they were
preserved from weeds and rank grass  and received the produce into
store when gathered

A black mould intermixed with sand  is considered the best soil for
the coffee plant  In selecting a situation for the gardens  the steep
declivities of mountains  where the plant would be endangered either
by the too powerful heat of the sun or an entire want of it  or where
torrents in the rainy season might wash away the rich earth necessary
for its growth  are avoided  The best situation for them is usually
considered to be in the vales along the foot of the high mountains  or
on the gentle declivities of the low range of hills  with which the
principal mountains are usually skirted  and it is found that   cÃ¦teris
paribus   the greater is the elevation of the garden  the longer is the
period of its productiveness  and the finer is the berry

Having selected a proper spot for the garden  the first operation is
to clear the ground of trees  shrubs  and the rank grass or reeds  the
latter of which  termed  galÃºga   are often found in these situations
and generally indicate a rich soil  In clearing the ground  it is the
practise to collect together into heaps  and burn the trees  roots
and other rubbish found on it  the ashes of which serve to enrich
the soil  when the trees are very large  the heavy labour of rooting
them up is avoided  and the trunks being cut about five feet from the
ground  are left in that state to rot  and in their gradual decay still
further to enrich the land  As soon as the ground is thus cleared  it
is levelled by three or four ploughings at short intervals  and laid
out to receive the plants  A fence is planted round them  about twelve
feet from their outer row  generally of the  jÃºrak   or palma christi
intermixed with either the  dÃ¡dap   or the silk cotton tree  and  in
low situations  outside of this a ditch is dug to carry off the water
These operations commence in August or September  and by the time the
ground is in perfect readiness for planting  the heavy rains are nearly
over  It then only remains to select the young plants  and prepare the
dÃ¡dap  which is intended to shade them

Of the  dÃ¡dap  tree there are three kinds  the  serÃ¡p    dÃ³ri   and
wÃ¡ru   but the first is preferred on account of the greater shade
it affords  It is propagated by cuttings  and in selecting them for
the coffee plantations  care is had that they are taken from trees at
least two or three years old  and that they be three or four feet long
of which one foot at least must be buried in the ground  After the
dÃ¡daps  are planted  holes are dug  from a foot and a half to two feet
deep  for the reception of the coffee plant  which is then removed from
the seed place or nursery  and transplanted into the gardens

In coffee gardens of four or five years old  are found quantities of
young plants  that have sprung up spontaneously from the ripe berries
dropping off the trees  and when these can be obtained about fourteen
inches long  of a strong healthy stem  large leaves  and without
branches  they are preferred to others  but as the plants thus procured
are seldom found in sufficient quantities  nurseries for rearing them
are formed as follows  When the berries are allowed to remain on the
shrub after maturity  they become black and dry  in this state they
are plucked  and sown in seed beds lightly covered with earth  as soon
as two small leaves appear  the plants are taken from the bed  and
transplanted  about a foot asunder  under the cover of sheds prepared
for that purpose  in about eighteen months  these plants are fit for
removing into the garden or plantation where they are destined to
yield their fruit  In taking the young plant up  the greatest care is
necessary not to injure the roots  especially the tap root  and with
this view it is generally removed with as much earth attached to it
as possible  This precaution has the additional advantage of not too
suddenly bringing the plant in contact with a new soil

The plantations are generally laid out in squares  The distance between
each plant varies according to the fertility of the soil  in a soil not
considered fertile  a distance of six feet is preserved  and in each
interval is a  dÃ¡dap  tree for the purpose of affording shade  but in a
rich soil  where the plant grows more luxuriantly  fewer  dÃ¡daps  are
necessary  and the plants are placed at a greater distance from each
other

On Java a certain degree of shade seems necessary to the health of
the coffee plant  especially in low situations and during its early
age  and the  dÃ¡dap  is found better calculated for affording this
protection than any other shrub in the country  It is a common saying
that where the  dÃ¡dap  flourishes  there also will flourish the coffee
but they are not always constant or necessary companions  for in high
lands many of the most flourishing gardens are to be observed with
very few  dÃ¡daps   The coffee tree yields fruit for a period of twenty
years  yet in the low lands it seldom attains a greater age than nine
or ten years  during six or seven of which only it may be said to
bear   and the fruit is comparatively large and tasteless

About the end of the rainy season  such coffee plants and  dÃ¡daps  as
have not thriven are replaced by others  and the plantations cleaned
this latter operation  in gardens well kept  is generally performed
three or four times in the year  but the tree is never cut or pruned
and is universally allowed to grow in all its native luxuriance  In
this state  it often in favoured situations attains the height of
sixteen feet  and plants of not less than eight inches broad have
frequently been procured from the trunk  The general average produce of
a coffee tree is not estimated at much more than a  kÃ¡ti   or a pound
and a quarter English  notwithstanding some yield from twenty to thirty
kÃ¡tis

There does not appear to be any fixed or certain season for the coffee
to arrive at maturity  In the  SÃºnda  districts the gathering usually
commences in June or July  and it is not till April that the whole
crop is delivered into store  The season  however  generally gives
what is termed three crops  of which the first is but small  the
second the most abundant  and the third  being what is left to ripen
may be considered rather as a gleaning  When the berries become of a
dark crimson colour  they are plucked one by one  with the assistance
of a light  bÃ¡mbu  ladder or stage  great care being taken not to
shake off the blossoms which are still on the tree  or to pluck the
unripe fruit  The women and children usually collect the crop  while
the husband is elsewhere engaged in harder labour  Attached to every
principal village  near which there are coffee plantations of any
extent  there is a drying house  to which the newly gathered coffee is
brought  it is there placed on hurdles  about four feet from the floor
under which a slow wood fire is kept up during the night  The roof of
the drying house is opened in the mornings and evenings  to admit the
air  and the berries are frequently stirred to prevent fermentation  As
the heat of the sun is considered prejudicial  the roof of the house
is closed during the day  This operation is repeated till the husk is
quite dry  The berries dried in this way are small  and of a sea green
or greyish colour  and are supposed to acquire a peculiar flavour from
the smoke  although it does not appear that any particular kind of wood
is used for fuel  When dried in the sun  the bean becomes of a pale
bleached colour  is larger  specifically lighter  and more insipid to
the taste than the former  The most common mode of freeing the bean
from the husk is  to pound the berries when dry in a bag of buffalo s
hide  great care being taken not to bruise the bean  A mill of simple
construction is sometimes used  but is not found to answer so well  The
coffee being then separated from the husk  is put into bags or baskets
and kept on raised platforms till the season of delivery  when it is
carried down to the storehouse  sometimes by men  but generally on the
backs of buffaloes and mares  in strings of fifteen hundred or two
thousand at a time

In the  SÃºnda  districts there have been  for many years past  three
principal depÃ´ts for receiving the coffee from the cultivators  viz
at  Buitenzorg    ChikÃ n   and  Karang sÃ¡mbang   From  Buitenzorg  it
is either sent direct to Batavia by land in carts  or by the way of
Linkong   whence it is forwarded in boats by the river  Chi dÃ¡ni
From  ChikÃ n  the coffee is sent in boats down the river  Chi tÃ¡ram
and thence along the sea coast to Batavia  From  Karang sÃ¡mbang  it is
sent down the river  Chi mÃ¡nok  to  Indra mÃ¡yu   where it is received
into extensive warehouses  and whence it is now generally exported for
the European market

Under this system  the  SÃºnda  districts were estimated to afford an
annual produce of one hundred thousand  pÃ­kuls  of one hundred and
thirty three pounds and a quarter each  and it was calculated that
the young plantations in the eastern districts  when they should come
into bearing  would produce an equal quantity  but in this latter
quarter  many of the gardens had been fixed on ill judged spots  and
the inhabitants were averse to the new and additional burden which
this cultivation imposed upon their labour  Had the system  therefore
even been persevered in  and enforced by a despotic authority  it is
questionable  whether the quantity anticipated in the above estimate
or even one half of it  would have been obtained from the eastern
districts  The  SÃºndas  living in an inland and mountainous country
and having been long accustomed to the hardship of the coffee culture
are less sensible of its pressure than the rest of their countrymen
time and habit have reconciled them to what was at first revolting
and what must always be considered as unjust  their modes of life
their arts  their domestic economy  and other social habits  have all
adapted themselves to a species of labour  which was at first forced
upon them  and a state of servitude  which the philosopher would
lament as a degradation  is scarcely felt to be a grievance by them
Instances  however  are not wanting  in which the usual measure of
exaction having been surpassed  they have been awakened to a sense of
their wretchedness  A government of colonial monopolists  eager only
for profit  and heedless of the sources from which it was derived
sometimes subjected its native subjects to distresses and privations
the recital of which would shock the ear of humanity  Suffice it to
say  that the coffee culture in the  SÃºnda  districts has sometimes
been so severely exacted  that together with the other constant and
heavy demands made by the European authority on the labour of the
country  they deprived the unfortunate peasants of the time necessary
to rear food for their support  Many have thus perished by famine
while others have fled to the crags of the mountains  where raising a
scanty subsistence in patches of  gÃ¡nga   or oftener dependent for it
upon the roots of the forest  they congratulated themselves on their
escape from the reach of their oppressors  Many of these people  with
their descendants  remain in these haunts to the present time  in their
annual migrations from hill to hill  they frequently pass over the
richest lands  which still remain uncultivated and invite their return
but they prefer their wild independence and precarious subsistence
to the horrors of being again subjected to forced services and forced
deliveries at inadequate rates

It is difficult to say what was the recompense received by the
cultivator previous to the year 1808  The complicated system of
accounts which then prevailed  seemed only calculated to blind the
government  and to allow the European commissary to derive an income of
from eighty to one hundred thousand dollars  25 000 l   per annum   at
the expence of the authorities by whom he was employed  and the natives
whom he oppressed  This  in common with most of the establishments on
the island  underwent a revision in the time of Marshal Daendels  and
it was then directed  that the cultivators should receive on delivery
at the storehouses  three rix dollars copper for each mountain  pÃ­kul
of two hundred and twenty five pounds Dutch  being little more than
one dollar per hundred weight  or one half penny per pound  This same
coffee was sometimes sold at Batavia  within fifty miles of the spot
where it was raised  at twenty Spanish dollars the hundred weight  and
has seldom been known to bring in the European market less than eleven
pence the pound  This  however  was deemed a liberal payment by the
Dutch  though in some cases it had been transported over sixty miles
of an almost impassable country  where two men are required to carry a
hundred weight of coffee  on their shoulders  at an expence of labour
which one would suppose at least equal to this remuneration

Under the administration of the British government  the free
cultivation of coffee  in common with that of all other articles  was
permitted to the inhabitants of Bantam   ChÃ©ribon   and all the eastern
districts  and at the time when the island was again ceded to the
Dutch  arrangements were in progress for extending the same provision
throughout the  SÃºnda  districts  under a conviction  that the quantity
produced would not be less under a system of free cultivation and free
trade  than under a system in which it was found necessary  as one of
the first acts of European authority  to compel the native princes to
direct  the total annihilation of the coffee culture within their
dominions   and to secure by treaty with them the destruction and
confiscation of all coffee found in the hands of the natives 46   A
considerable portion of the peasantry  as already observed  have long
been accustomed to the cultivation  and it is owing to their skill and
experience  as much as to any direct superintendence or interference
of the European officers  who generally derive their information from
the native chiefs  and have little more to do  than occasionally to
ride through the garden with a pompous suite  keep the accounts  and
examine the coffee as it is received   that the coffee has so long
been furnished for the European market  the experience obtained in
the eastern districts  during the last three years  proves at least
that coercive measures are unnecessary  There are many parts of Java
particularly the  PrÃ­ang en  regencies  where the soil is peculiarly
and eminently adapted to the cultivation  and although it is difficult
yet awhile to fix the exact rate at which the coffee might be produced
under a free system  it may be calculated to be raised for exportation
at about forty shillings per hundred weight

Of the quality of the Javan coffee  in comparison with that of other
countries  it may be observed  that during the last years  it has
invariably maintained its price in the European market in competition
with that of Bourbon  and rather exceeded it  both of them being higher
than the produce of the West Indies  During the last years of the
British administration on Java  and after the opening of the European
market again afforded a demand  about eleven millions of young coffee
shrubs were planted out in new gardens

Pepper  which at one time formed the principal export from Java  has
for some time ceased to be cultivated to any considerable extent  It
was principally raised in Bantam  and the dependencies of that province
in the southern part of Sumatra  and in the flourishing state of the
monopoly  these districts furnished the Dutch with the chief supply for
the European market

But the system by which it was procured was too oppressive and
unprincipled in its nature  and too impolitic in its provisions  to
admit of long duration  It was calculated to destroy the energies of
the country  and with them  the source from whence the fruits of this
monopoly proceeded  In the year 1811  accordingly  neither Bantam nor
its dependencies furnished the European government with one pound of
this article

That pepper may be produced on Java  and supplied at a rate equally
moderate with that at which other productions requiring similar care
are furnished  cannot admit of a doubt  and this reasonable price
may be estimated at about six or seven Spanish dollars  thirty to
thirty five shillings  the pÃ­kul  The plant grows luxuriantly in
most soils  and when once reared requires infinitely less care and
labour than coffee  The cultivation of it on Sumatra and Prince of
Wales  Island having been so accurately and minutely described by Mr
Marsden and Dr  Hunter  it would be unnecessary here to detail the
system followed on Java  as it is in most points the same  The only
peculiarity regarding it which may deserve notice is  that on this
island the plant is allowed to grow to a much greater size  entwining
itself round the cotton trees  frequently to the height of fifty and
sixty feet

Indigo  called  tom  by the Javans  and by the  SÃºndas tÃ¡rum   is
general  and raised in most parts of the island  The indigo prepared
by the natives is of an indifferent quality  and in a semifluid state
and contains much quick lime  but that prepared by Europeans is of very
superior quality

An inferior variety  denominated  tom mÃ©nir   having smaller seeds
and being of quicker growth  is usually planted as a second crop in
sÃ¡wahs   on which one rice crop has been raised  In these situations
the plant rises to the height of about three feet and a half  It is
then cut  and the cuttings are repeated three  or even four times
till the ground is again required for the annual rice crop  But the
superior plant  when cultivated on  tÃ©gal  lands  and on a naturally
rich soil  not impoverished by a previous heavy crop  rises in height
above five feet  and grows with the greatest luxuriance  The plants
intended for seeds are raised in favoured spots on the ridges of the
rice fields in the neighbourhood of the villages  and the seed of one
district is frequently exchanged for that of another  That of the rich
mountainous districts being esteemed of best quality  is occasionally
introduced into the low lands  and is thought necessary to prevent
that degeneration  which would be the consequence of cultivating for
a long time the same plant upon the same soil  In the province of
MatÃ¡rem   where indigo is most extensively cultivated  it is sold in
the market in bundles  as low as eight pence the pÃ­kul weight  but in
the vicinity of  SemÃ¡rang   and in districts where it is not produced
in great abundance  it bears an advance upon this price of fifty per
cent

The climate  soil  and state of society on Java  seem to offer peculiar
advantages to the extensive cultivation of this plant  and under the
direction of skilful manufacturers  the dye stuff might form a most
valuable and important export for the European market  The periodical
draughts and inundations  which confine the cultivation and manufacture
in the Bengal provinces to a few months in the year  are unknown in
Java  where the plant might  in favoured situations  be cultivated
nearly throughout the whole year  and where at least it would be
secure of a prolonged period of that kind of weather  necessary for
the cutting  The soil is superior  and a command of water affords
facilities seldom to be met with elsewhere  while  from the tenure on
which the cultivators hold their land  and the state of society among
them  advances on account of the ensuing crop  which in Bengal form so
ruinous a part of an indigo concern  are here unnecessary  and would be
uncalled for

The dye   nÃ­la  blue  is prepared by the natives in a liquid state  by
infusing the leaves with a quantity of lime  in this state it forms
by far the principal dye of the country  Besides the quantity of it
consumed within the island  it is sometimes exported to neighbouring
countries by native traders  and sold at the rate of from a dollar and
a half to three dollars the  pÃ­kul   according as the plant may be in
abundance or otherwise

It is impossible to form any idea of the rate at which this species of
dye can reasonably be manufactured for the European market  from the
prices paid by the Dutch  both because the article was one of those
classed by them under the head of forced deliveries  and because the
regents  who were entrusted with its exclusive management  not fully
understanding the process of making it  conducted it always in a very
expensive way  and were frequently exposed to entire failures

The cotton of the country  distinguished by the name of  kÃ¡pas jÃ¡wa
is a variety of the gossypium herbaceum  but it is inferior to that
generally cultivated on the Indian continent  which is also found on
Java  and called by the Javans  kÃ¡pas mÃºri   The plant of the former
differs from the latter  in having a smaller stem  and in yielding a
material  both of coarser fibre and in less quantity  There is a third
variety  with a subarborescent stem  called  kÃ¡pas tÃ¡hon   which is
very scarce  Trials remain to be made  to determine how far the culture
of the Indian cotton might be extended  so as to supersede the Javan
cotton  The inferior kind  which forms the principal  and indeed with
the mass of the people the only material for clothing  is cultivated in
almost every part of the island  The soil  however  is not considered
as universally favourable to its growth  many of the low lands
consisting of a clay  which bursts in the dry season  are unfit for it
and on several of the more fertile districts  where the plant itself
flourishes  little cotton is obtained from it  the declivities of the
hills  in which the mountain rice is raised  yield in general the best
and most abundant supply  At present  scarcely a sufficient quantity is
produced on the island to employ the female part of the inhabitants
and one district often depends upon another for the principal part of
what it uses  The cotton of  BÃ¡nyumÃ¡s  is exported to  BÃ¡galen   to
TÃ©gal   and the western parts of  MatÃ¡rem   where it is manufactured
the environs of  Wong go    Adi langÃº   and other places towards the
southern hills  supply both the capitals in the interior   Kediri
PranÃ¡rÃ¡ga   and the vicinity  likewise furnish considerable quantities
for other parts of the island  In the  SÃºnda  districts  the principal
supply is received from the east and west  JÃ¡mpang   The culture of
cotton  and the manufacture of yarn  are in some degree promoted by an
ancient custom  which imposes on every householder or village a certain
contingent of cotton yarn for the sovereign  or for the person who
holds the land on his account  this custom is called  panyÃºmpleng   The
chiefs on Java  and particularly on  BÃ¡li   frequently wear a skein
of cotton yarn entwined round the handle of the kris  a custom which
sufficiently indicates the respect paid to this species of cultivation

The Javan cotton is a hardy plant  which grows to about the height of
a foot and a half  It is generally planted on the  sÃ¡wahs  after the
reaping of the rice crop  and yields the cotton in less than three
months  The Indian cotton grows to a larger size  and produces a
material of an infinitely superior quality  but it is more delicate in
its nature  must be watched with greater care  and requires a month
longer to attain to maturity  Cotton cultivated on  tÃ©gal   or dry
land  is considered as generally better than that raised as a second
crop on  sÃ¡wah   and this mode of cultivation has been adduced as the
cause of the superiority ascribed to the cotton of  BÃ¢li   and other
more eastern islands

Tobacco  47  termed by the natives  tombÃ¡ku   or  sÃ¡ta   is an
article of very general cultivation  but is only extensively raised
for exportation in the central districts of  KedÃº  and  BÃ¡nyumÃ¡s
as it requires a soil of the richest mould  but at the same time not
subject to inundations  these districts hold out peculiar advantages
to the tobacco planter  not to be found on the low lands  For internal
consumption  small quantities are raised in convenient spots every
where  but the most eastern districts and  MadÃºra  are principally
supplied from  PÃºgar   Bantam receives its supply from  BÃ¡nyumÃ¡s   by
means of native traders from  PakalÃºngan  visiting that port in small
craft  The produce of  KedÃº  is conveyed by men to  SemÃ¡rang   the
great port of exportation

In  Kedu  it forms  after rice  by far the most important article
of cultivation  and  in consequence of the fitness of the soil  the
plant grows to the height of from eight to ten feet  on lands not
previously dressed or manured  with a luxuriance seldom witnessed in
India  Cultivated here alternately with rice  only one crop of either
is obtained within the year  but after the harvest of the rice  or
the gathering of the tobacco leaves  the land is allowed to remain
fallow  till the season again arrives for preparing it to receive the
other  The young plant is not raised within the district  but procured
from the high lands in the vicinity  principally from the district of
KÃ¡li bÃ©ber   on the slope of the mountain  DÃ­eng  or  PrÃ¡hu   where it
is raised and sold by the hundred to the cultivators of the adjoining
districts  The transplantation takes place in the month of June  and
the plant is at its full growth in October

Wheat has been introduced by the Europeans  and cultivated with success
to the extent required by the European population  It thrives in many
parts of the interior of the country  it is sown in May  and reaped in
October  and  where the cultivation has been left to the Javans  the
grain has been sold at the rate of about seven rupees the  pÃ­kul

Potatoes have been cultivated during the last forty years  in elevated
situations  near all the principal European establishments  and are
reckoned of a quality superior to those ordinarily procured in Bengal
or China  Few of the natives  however  have as yet adopted them as a
common article of food  Besides potatoes  most of the common culinary
vegetables of Europe are raised in the gardens of the Europeans and
Chinese  It must be confessed  however  that they degenerate  if
perpetuated on the soil without change  and that their abundance and
quality depends  in a great measure  on the supplies of fresh seed
imported from Europe  the Cape  or other quarters

Having now given an account of the different kinds of produce raised
within the island  and the arts of husbandry practised by the natives
I shall conclude this short sketch of Javan agriculture by an account
of the tenure of landed property  the rights of the proprietor and
tenant  the proportion of the produce paid for rent  the division of
farms among the inhabitants of villages  and the causes that have
obstructed or promoted agricultural improvements

The relative situation  rank  and privileges of the village farmer and
the native chief in Java  correspond in most instances  with those
of the Ryot and Zemindar of Bengal  but the more frequent and more
immediate interference of the sovereign  in the former case  with any
tendency to established usage or prescriptive claim  has left no room
for that difference of opinion  concerning proprietary right  which
exercised the ingenuity of the highest authorities in the latter  In
Bengal  before the introduction of the permanent revenue settlement
there were usages  institutions  and established modes of proceeding
with regard to landed estates  that rendered it doubtful in which of
the three parties more immediately interested  the proprietary right
should finally and lawfully be settled  The claim of the Ryot to
retain the land which he cultivated  so long as he paid the stipulated
contribution  seemed to raise his character above that of an ordinary
tenant removeable at pleasure  or at the conclusion of a stipulated
term  The situation of the Zemindar  as the actual receiver of the
rents  standing between the sovereign and the cultivator  although
merely for the purpose of paying them over with certain deductions to
the sovereign  and his frequently transmitting the office with its
emoluments to his children  although held only during pleasure  gave
his character some affinity to that of an European landholder  And
lastly  the sovereign himself  who ultimately received the rents  and
regulated them at his pleasure  and removed both Zemindar and Ryot  in
case of negligence or disobedience  was arrayed with the most essential
attributes of proprietary right  or at least exercised a power that
could render any opposite claims nugatory  Thus the Ryot  the Zemindar
and the Sovereign  had each his pretensions to the character of
landholder  After much cautious inquiry and deliberate discussion on
the part of our Indian government  the claims of the Zemindars  rather
perhaps from considerations of policy than a clear conviction of their
superior right  were preferred  In Java  however  except in the cases
of a few alienated lands and in the  SÃºnda  districts  of which more
will be said hereafter  no such pretensions are heard of  as those
which were advocated on the part of the Zemindars of western India
although inquiries to ascertain the equitable and legitimate rights of
all classes of the people  were known to be in progress  and a plan
was declared to be in contemplation for their permanent adjustment
From every inquiry that was instituted under the British government
and every fact that was presented to the view of its officers  it
appeared that  in the greatest part of the island  in the eastern and
middle districts  and in short in those provinces where rent to any
considerable amount was attainable  there existed no proprietary right
between that of the sovereign and that of the cultivator  that the
government was the only landholder

There are lands  indeed  which contribute nothing to the state  some
on which the cultivator pays no rent whatever  and others of which the
rent remains in the hands of his immediate superior  but the manner
in which individuals acquire  and the tenure by which they hold such
lands  form illustrations and proofs of the proprietary right of the
sovereign  As his resources arise almost entirely from the share of
produce which he exacts  and as he considers himself invested with an
absolute dominion over that share  he burthens certain villages or
estates with the salaries of particular officers  allots others for
the support of his relatives or favourites  or grants them for the
benefit of particular charitable or religious institutions  in the same
manner as  before the Consolidation Act in this country  the interest
of particular loans were fixed upon the produce of specific imposts
Here the alienation shews the original right  the sovereign renounces
the demand to which he was entitled  he makes no claim upon the farmer
for a share of the crop himself  but orders it to be paid over to
those whom he thus appoints in his place  so far as the gift extends
With the exception of the  SÃºnda  districts  as already stated  and
a comparatively inconsiderable portion of land thus alienated on
different conditions  the proprietary right to the soil in Java vests
universally in the government  whether exercised by native princes or
by colonial authority  and that permanent and hereditary interest in it
so necessary to its improvement  those individual rights of property
which are created by the laws and protected by the government  are
unknown  With these exceptions  neither law nor usage authorizes the
oldest occupant of land in Java to consider the ground which he has
reclaimed from waste  or the farm on which he has exerted all his
industry  as his own  by such a tenure as will enable him  and his
successors for ever  to reap the fruits of his labour  He can have
gained no title  even to a definite term of occupancy  but from the
capricious servant of a capricious despot  who himself is not legally
bound by his engagement  and whose successor is not even morally bound
by it

As a matter of convenience  the same cultivator may continue to occupy
the same portion of land for life  and his children  after his decease
may inherit the ground which he cultivated  paying the dues to which he
was liable  The head of a village  whether called  BÃºkul    Peting gi
or  LÃºrah   may be continued in the collection of the village rents
for life  and may be succeeded in office by his heirs  the superior
officer  or  DemÃ¡ng   with whom he accounts  may likewise hold his
situation for a long period  and transmit it to his family  but none of
them can stand in the possession against the will of their immediate
superior  or of the sovereign  by any claim of law or custom

Little of the revenue collected from the occupants is transmitted to
the government treasury  the greatest part of that which is raised  and
which  in other countries  would come into the hands of government
for subsequent distribution among its servants and the support of its
various establishments  is intercepted in its progress by those to
whom the sovereign immediately assigns it  The officers of police  of
justice  of the prince s household  and  in short  public servants of
all classes  from the prime minister down to the lowest menial  are
paid with appropriations of the rent of land

To this general principle of Javan law and usage  that the government
is the only landholder  there are exceptions  as I mentioned before
in some districts of the island  These are chiefly in the districts
inhabited by the  SÃºndas   who occupy the mountainous and woody country
in the western division of the island  Among them  private property
in the soil is generally established  the cultivator can transmit his
possession to his children  among them  it can be subdivided  without
any interference on the part of a superior  the possessor can sell
his interest in it to others  and transfer it by gift or covenant
He pays to his chief a certain proportion of the produce  in the
same manner as the other inhabitants of Java  because  in a country
without trade or manufactures  labour or produce is the only shape
in which he can contribute to support the necessary establishments of
the community  So long as he advances this tribute  which is one tenth
or one fifth of the gross produce  he has an independent right to the
occupancy of his land  and the enjoyment of the remainder  The reason
why the landed tenure of these districts differs  in so important a
particular  from that of the most extensive and valuable part of the
island  may perhaps be explained from their nature  without resorting
to any original difference in the laws of property  or the maxims of
government  Where the population is small in proportion to the extent
of soil  and much land remains unoccupied  the best only will become
the subject of demand and appropriation  The latter alone is valuable
because it yields great returns for little labour  and therefore offers
inducements to engage in its cultivation  in spite of many artificial
disadvantages  it alone can afford a desirable surplus  after
maintaining the hands that call for its fertility  and consequently
tempts power to reserve unalienated the right to this surplus  On the
other hand  when waste ground is to be reclaimed  when forests or
jungle are to be cleared  or when a sterile and ungrateful spot is
to be cultivated  the government have less interest in reserving the
surplus  and must offer superior inducements of immunity  permanency
or exemption  to lead to cultivation  On this principle  the tenure
of land in the  SÃºnda  districts  and on some parts of the coast
may be accounted for  It may be concluded  that many of these lands
were reclaimed from waste by the present occupiers or their immediate
predecessors  and their rights to possess them  which is similar to
that which the discoverer of an unappropriated field  forest  or
mine would have  by nature  to as many of their products as he could
realize by his labours  has not been crushed or interfered with by
the sovereign  a forbearance  probably  more to be attributed to
motives of prudence than to the restraint of law  Nearly coincident
with this conclusion is the supposition which assumes  that before
the introduction of the Mahomedan system  and the encroachments of
despotic sovereigns  all the lands on the island were considered as the
property of those who cultivated them  but that  as the value of the
most fertile spots became more apparent  while the labour which had
been originally expended in clearing them  and constituted the title to
their original occupancy  was gradually forgotten  the government found
inducements and facilities to increase its demands  and thus became
possessed of the rights of some by violence  while it rendered those
of all unworthy of being preserved  The land tenures of the  SÃºnda
districts  according to this hypothesis  are only wrecks of the general
system  which have been protected against encroachment  because they
did not so powerfully invite rapacity  Whatever truth there may be
in this opinion  the fact is undoubted  that in the mountainous and
less fertile districts of Java  and in the island of  BÃ¡li   where the
Mahomedan sway has not yet extended  individual proprietary right in
the soil is fully established  while in that portion of Java where the
Mahomedan rule has been most felt  and where proprietary right amounts
to the greatest value  it vests almost exclusively in the sovereign

The situation  however  of the cultivator in the Sunda districts  who
is a proprietor  is not much more eligible than that of the tenant of
the government  he may  it is true  alienate or transfer his lands
but while he retains them  he is liable to imposts almost as great as
they can bear  and when he transfers them  he can therefore expect
little for surrendering to another the privilege of reaping from his
own soil  what is only the average recompense of labour expended on
the estate of another  The Revenue Instructions  therefore  bearing
date the 11th February 1814  and transmitted from the local government
to the officers intrusted with the charge of the several provinces
subject to its authority  lay down the following general position   The
nature of the landed tenure throughout the island is now thoroughly
understood  Generally speaking  no proprietary right in the soil is
vested in any between the actual cultivator and the sovereign  the
intermediate classes  who may have at any time enjoyed the revenues of
villages or districts  being deemed merely the executive officers of
government  who received these revenues from the gift of their lord
and who depended on his will alone for their tenure  Of this actual
proprietary right there can be no doubt that the investiture rested
solely in the sovereign  but it is equally certain  that the first
clearers of the land entitled themselves  as a just reward  to such a
real property in the ground they thus in a manner created  that while
a due tribute of a certain share of its produce was granted to the
sovereign power for the protection it extended  the government  in
return  was equally bound not to disturb them or their heirs in its
possession  This disposal of the government share was thus  therefore
all that could justly depend on the will of the ruling authority
and consequently  the numerous gifts of land made in various periods
by the several sovereigns  have in no way affected the rights of the
actual cultivators  All that government could alienate was merely its
own revenue or share of the produce  This subject has come fully under
discussion  and the above result  as regarding this island  has been
quite satisfactorily established   It is remarked  in a subsequent
paragraph of the same instructions   that there have been  it is known
in many parts of the country  grants from the sovereign of lands in
perpetuity  which are regularly inheritable  and relative to which
the original documents still exist  Of these  some have been made for
religious purposes  others as rewards or provision for relatives or
the higher nobility  These alienations  as far as it was justly in the
power of the sovereign to make  must certainly be held sacred  but
their extent should be clearly defined  that the rights of others be
not compromised by them  The government share  when granted  will not
be reclaimed  but the rights of the cultivator must not be affected
by these grants  Such proprietors of revenue  as they may be termed
shall in short be allowed to act  with regard to the cultivators on
their estates  as government acts towards those on its own lands
that is  they shall receive a fixed share of the produce  but whilst
that is duly delivered  they shall neither exact more nor remove any
individual from his land   It is remarked by Major Yule  the British
resident  in his Report on Bantam  that there   all property in the
soil is vested exclusively in the hands of the sovereign power  but
in consequence of its having been long customary to confer grants of
land upon the different branches of the royal family  and other chiefs
and favourites about court  a very small portion was left without some
claimant or other  The  pÃºsÃ¡kas  granted to the relations of the
Sultan were considered as real property  and sometimes descended to the
heirs of the family  and at others were alienated from it by private
sale  To effect a transfer of this nature  the previous sanction of the
Sultan was necessary  after which the party waited on the high priest
or  Mangku bumi   who made the necessary inquiries  and delivered the
title deeds to the purchaser  in which were specified the situation
extent  boundaries  and price of the land sold  A register of sales
was kept by the priests  the purchaser paying the fees  and it rarely
occurred that lands sold in this manner were ever resumed by the
crown  without some adequate compensation being made to the purchaser
PÃºsÃ¡kas  given to chiefs for services performed  were recoverable
again at pleasure  and always reverted to the crown on the demise of
the chief to whom they had been granted  in all other respects  the
same privileges were annexed to them as to the former  The holders of
pÃºsÃ¡ka  lands were very seldom the occupants  they generally remained
about the court  and on the approach of the rice harvest deputed
agents to collect their share of the crop  They do not let their
lands for specific periods  The cultivators are liable to be turned
out at pleasure  and when ejected  have no claims to compensation
for improvements made while in possession  such as water courses  or
plantations of fruit trees made by themselves or their parents

We must make a distinction   say the Dutch Commissioners appointed to
investigate this subject in 1811   between the  PrÃ­angÃ©n  regencies
the province of  ChÃ©ribon   and the eastern districts  Throughout the
whole extent of the  PrÃ­angen  regencies exists a pretended property
on uncultivated lands  on which no person can settle without the
consent of the inhabitants of that  dÃ©sa   or village  In the  sÃ¡wah
fields  or cultivated lands  every inhabitant  from the Regent down to
the lowest rank  has a share  and may act with it in what manner he
pleases  either sell  let  or otherwise dispose of it  and loses that
right only by leaving the village in a clandestine manner

In the province of  ChÃ©ribon   according to the ancient constitution
each district and  dÃ©sa   like the  PrÃ­angen  regencies  has its own
lands  with the difference  however  that whilst those regencies are
considered as belonging to villages and individuals  here the villages
and lands are altogether the pretended property of the chiefs  or of
the relations or favourites of the Sultans  who even might dispose of
the same  with one exception  however  of that part allotted to the
common people  Sometimes the Sultans themselves were owners of  dÃ©sas
and chiefs of the same  in which case the inhabitants were better
treated than in the former instances  If an individual thought himself
wronged by the chief  who either sold  hired out  or otherwise disposed
of his lands  he took his revenge  not on that chief  but on the person
who held possession of the property  To corroborate this statement it
may be mentioned  that the lands in the district of  ChÃ©ribon  were for
the most part farmed out to Chinese  who increased their extortions
in proportion as the chief raised his farm or rent  and thus almost
deprived the common people of all their means

On the north east coast of the eastern districts  no person can be
called a proprietor of rice fields or other lands  the whole country
belongs to government  and in this light do all the Regents consider
it  The rice fields of a regency are divided among the whole of the
population  in the division the chiefs have a share  according to their
rank  occupations  or taxes they are paying

The chief enjoys his lands as long as he holds his station  the
common people for a year only  when it falls to the share of another
inhabitant of the  dÃ©sa   or village  that all may reap a benefit from
it in turn  The ideas of the Javans concerning tenures  thus appear to
be of three kinds  in the  SÃºnda  division they consist in allotting
to the villages of uncultivated  and to individual persons of certain
portions in the cultivated or sÃ¡wah fields  in  ChÃ©ribon   the sultans
and chiefs  as well as the common people  assert pretensions to similar
allotments  in the eastern districts  on the contrary  nobody pretends
to the possession of land  every one is satisfied with the regulation
laid down  but if a man s share is withheld  he is apt to emigrate  No
person considers himself bound to servitude  The Javans  however  in
the  PrÃ­ang en  regencies  in  ChÃ©ribon   and in the eastern districts
pretend to have an unquestionable right to all the fruit trees and
sÃ­ri  plants  at or near their  kÃ¡mpung  or  dÃ©sa

There is not   says Mr  Knops  another of the Dutch Commissioners
a single Javan  who supposes that the soil is the property of the
Regent  but they all seem to be sensible that it belongs to government
usually called the sovereign among them  considering the Regent as a
subject like themselves  who holds his district and authority from
the sovereign  His idea of property is modified by the three kinds
of subjects to which it is applied  rice fields   gÃ¢gas   and fruit
trees  A Javan has no rice fields he can call his own  those of which
he had the use last year will be exchanged next year for others  They
circulate  as in the regency of  SemÃ¡rang   from one person to another
and if any one were excluded  he would infallibly emigrate  It is
different with the  gÃ¡gas   or lands where dry rice is cultivated  the
cultivator who clears such lands from trees or brushwood  and reclaims
them from a wilderness  considers himself as proprietor of the same
and expects to reap its fruits without diminution or deduction  With
regard to fruit trees  the Javan cultivator claims those he has planted
as his legal property  without any imposts  if a chief were to trespass
against this right  the village would soon be deserted  The Javan
however  has not  in my opinion  any real idea of property even in his
fruit trees  but usage passes with him for a law  All dispositions made
by the chief  not contrary to custom or the  Ã¡dat   are considered as
legal  and likewise all that would contribute to ease the people  by
lessening or reducing the capitation tax  the contingent  the feudal
services  in short all the charges imposed upon them  A different
system would be contrary to custom  Whatever favours the people is
legal  whatever oppresses them is an infraction of the custom

The tenure of land in the native provinces is the same generally as
in the eastern districts  Thus stands the question with regard to the
proprietary right to the soil in Java  but it is of more consequence
in an agricultural point of view  and consequently more to my present
purpose  to inquire how that right is generally exercised  than in
whom it resides  Though the cultivator had no legal title to his lands
there might still be such a prevalent usage in favour of his perpetual
occupancy  as would secure him in the enjoyment of his possession
and enable him to reap the fruits of his industry equally with the
protection of his positive law

But unfortunately for the prosperity of the people  this was far from
being generally the case  The cultivator had little security for
continued occupancy  but the power  on his part  of enduring unlimited
oppression without removing from under it  or the interest of his
immediate superior in retaining a useful slave  and as he could not
expect to reap in safety the fruits of his industry  beyond the bare
supply of his necessities  he carried that industry no farther than
his necessities demanded  The sovereign knew little about the state of
his tenantry or the conduct of his agents  and viewed the former only
as instruments to create the resources  which the latter were employed
to collect or administer  All his care was to procure as much from the
produce of the soil and industry of his subjects as possible  and the
complaints of the people  who suffered under the exactions of these
chiefs  were intercepted on their way to the throne  and perhaps would
have been disregarded had they reached it  The sovereign delegates his
authority over a province of greater or less extent  to a high officer
called  AdipÃ¡ti    TumÃºng gung   or  Ang ebÃ¡i   who is himself paid
by the rent of certain portions of land  and is responsible for the
revenues of the districts over which he is appointed  He  in his turn
elects an officer  called  DemÃ¡ng  or  MÃ¡ntridÃ©sa   to administer the
subdivisions or districts of the province  to appoint the chiefs  and
to collect the rents of several villages  The village chief   BÃºkul
LÃºrah   or whatever designation he bears in the different parts of
the island  thus appointed by his immediate superior  is placed in
the administration of the village  required to collect the government
share of the crop from the cultivator  and to account for it to the
DemÃ¡ng   In some provinces  the village elects its own chief  called
PetÃ­ng gi   who exercises similar functions with the  BÃºkul  appointed
by government  as will be afterwards more particularly observed in
the account of the native administration  As all the officers of
government  of whatever rank  are paid their salaries in the produce
of the land  the  BÃºkuls  and the  DemÃ¡ngs  become responsible for the
share of the appropriations of villages to this account  as much as
if it went into the government treasury  They are themselves paid by
the reservation of a certain share of what they collect  and of course
are always ready to please their employers  and to increase their own
emoluments  by enforcing every practicable exaction  Every officer
has unlimited power over those below him  and is himself subject to
the capricious will of the sovereign or his minister  When the Regent
makes any new or exorbitant demand upon those whom he immediately
superintends  they must exact it with an increased degree of rigor over
the chiefs of villages  who are thus  in their turn  forced to press
upon the cultivator  with the accumulated weight of various gradations
of despotism

The  BÃºkul   or the  PetÃ­ng gi  is the immediate head of the village
and however much his authority is modified in particular districts
has always extensive powers  To the cultivators  he appears in the
character of the real landholder  as they have no occasion to look
beyond him to the superior  by whom he is controlled  He distributes
the lands to the different cultivators on such shares  and in such
conditions  as he pleases  or as custom warrants  assesses the rents
they have to pay  allots them their village duties  measures the
produce of their fields  and receives the government proportion  He
sometimes himself cultivates a small portion of land  and in so far
is regarded only as a tenant  like the rest of the villagers  He is
accountable for all the collections he realizes  with the reservation
of a fifth part for his trouble  which share must be viewed merely
as the emoluments of office  and not as the rent of the landlord  or
the profits of a farmer  He sometimes holds his situation immediately
of the sovereign  or by the election of the cultivators  but more
generally from the intermediate agent of government  whom I have
mentioned above  to whom he is accountable for his receipts  By his
superior he may be removed at pleasure  although the local knowledge
and accumulated means  which are the consequence of the possession of
office  generally insure its duration to his person for a considerable
period  or as long as his superior himself retains his power

The lands which he superintends and apportions range from six or seven
to double that number of  jungs   or from forty or fifty to an hundred
acres English  and these are divided among the inhabitants of his
village  generally varying from about two acres to half an acre each
That this minute division of land takes place  may be shewn from the
surveys made under the British government in the eastern provinces
which nearly resemble those under the dominion of the native princes
and consequently may be taken as indicating the general state of the
island  The inhabitants in the agricultural districts of the residency
of  SurabÃ¡ya  amount in all to 129 938  these compose 33 141 families
of which 32 618 belong to the class of cultivators  and 523 belonging
to other professions pay only a ground rent for their houses  The area
of the province contains about twelve hundred square miles  or 34 955
jungs   about 20 000 only of which are cultivated  so as to become of
any consequence in the division of lands among the villages  the number
of which amount to 2 770  By a calculation founded on these data  it
would appear  that each village averages about twelve families  that
a family falls considerably short of the average of four  and that a
little more than seven  jungs  are allotted to a village  In  KedÃº  the
population amounts to 197 310  the number of villages to 3879  and the
quantity of cultivated land to 19 052  jungs   so that in this province
there are about five  jungs  attached to a village  and a village is
inhabited by fifty one souls  or about twelve or thirteen families
In  GrÃ©sik   the number of villages amount to 1396  the quantity of
cultivated land to 17 018  jungs   and the population to 115 442
souls  In  ProbalÃ­ng o  and  BesÃºki   the numbers are  of inhabitants
104 359  of villages  827  of cultivated land  13 432  jungs   In these
two last the proportions vary  the number of  jungs  to a village in
the former being more than twelve  and of inhabitants more than eighty
or about twenty families  and in the latter  the proportion is more
than one hundred and twenty souls to a village possessed of more than
sixteen  jungs  of land  It would be superfluous to state any more
examples  In different parts of the island  there are variations within
certain limits  but the quantity of land occupied by one cultivator
seldom exceeds a  bÃ¡hu    or the quarter of a  jung    although
the quantity occupied by a village  as will be seen by the above
instances  varies from five to sixteen  according to the extent of the
population

The land allotted to each separate cultivator is managed by himself
exclusively  and the practice of labouring in common  which is usual
among the inhabitants of the same village on continental India  is
here unknown  Every one  generally speaking  has his own field  his
own plough  his own buffaloes or oxen  prepares his farm with his
own hand  or the assistance of his family at seed time  and reaps
it by the same means at harvest  By the recent surveys  when every
thing concerning the wealth and the resources of the country became
the subject of inquiry  and means were employed to obtain the most
accurate information  it was ascertained  that the number of buffaloes
on that part of the island to which these surveys extended  was nearly
in the proportion of one to a family  or a pair to two families  and
that  including the yokes of oxen  which are to those of buffaloes as
one to three  this proportion would be very much exceeded  In some
provinces  more exclusively devoted to grain cultivation  the number of
ploughs  and of course oxen or buffaloes  nearly amounts to one to a
family  In other cases  where they fall much short of this proportion
a considerable part of the inhabitants must be engaged in labours
unconnected with agriculture  or the cultivators must be engaged in
rearing produce  where the assistance of those animals is not required
Thus in  JapÃ¡ra  and  JawÃ¡na   where the number of inhabitants is
103 290  or about twenty six thousand families  the number of ploughs
amount to 20 730  and of buffaloes to 43 511  while in the Batavian
Regencies  where the coffee culture employs a considerable part of the
inhabitants  the number of families is about sixty thousand  and of
ploughs only 17 366  The lands on Java are so minutely divided among
the inhabitants of the villages  that each receives just as much as can
maintain his family and employ his individual industry

    A time there was  ere England s griefs began
   When ev ry rood of ground maintain d its man
   For him light labour spread her wholesome store
   Just gave what life requir d  and gave no more
   His best companions  innocence and health
   And his best riches  ignorance of wealth

But situated as the Javan peasantry are  there is but little
inducement to invest capital in agriculture  and much labour must be
unprofitably wasted  as property is insecure  there can be no desire
of accumulation  as food is easily procured  there can be no necessity
for vigorous labour  There exists  as a consequence of this state of
nature and of the laws  few examples of great affluence or abject
distress among the peasantry  no rich men  and no common beggars  Under
the native governments and the Regents of the Dutch Company  there
were no written leases or engagements binding for a term of years  nor
could such contracts well be expected to be formed with an officer  who
held his own place by so unstable a tenure as the will of a despot
The cultivator bargained with the  BÃºkul  or  PetÃ­ng gi  for a season
or for two crops  had his land measured off by the latter  and paid a
stipulated portion of the produce either in money or in kind  When the
crop had arrived at maturity  the cultivator  if his engagement was for
so much of the produce in kind  cut down his own share  and left that
of the landlord on the ground

The proportion of the crop paid as rent varied with the kind of land
or produce  and the labour employed by the cultivator  In the  sÃ¡wah
lands  the share demanded by the landlord rarely exceeded one half
and might fall as low as one fourth  according as the quality of the
soil was good or bad  or the labour employed in irrigating or otherwise
preparing it was greater or less  In  tÃ©gal  lands  the rent paid
varied from one third to one fifth of the produce  a diminution to
be attributed to the uncertainty of the crop  and the necessity of
employing more labour to realize an equal produce than on the other
species of cultivation  In cases where there was a second crop of less
value than the principal rice or maize crop  no additional demand was
made upon the additional grain reaped by the farmer

If such rates had been equitably fixed  after a deliberate estimate of
the proportion between the labour of the cultivator and his produce
and if from the best kind of  sÃ¡wah  no more than the half had been
required  with a scale of rents diminishing as labour increased or the
soil deteriorated  the peasant could have had no reason to complain of
the exactions of government A  jung  of the best  sÃ¡wah  lands will
produce between forty and fifty  Ã¡mats  of  pÃ¡ri   each  Ã¡mat  weighing
about one thousand pounds  Suppose a cultivator occupied a quarter
of a  jung  of such land  he would reap ten  Ã¡mats   or ten thousand
pounds of  pÃ¡ri   and allowing a half for the government deduction
would still retain five thousand pounds  which is equal to about eight
quarters of wheat  The best  sÃ¡wah  lands return about forty fold
sÃ¡wah  lands of the second quality yield from thirty to forty  Ã¡mats
the  jung   and they are considered of inferior quality when they yield
less than thirty  From these last  two fifths or one third was required
as the landlord s share   TÃ©gal  lands were assessed at one third  one
fourth  or one fifth of their produce  according to their quality  and
their produce in value is about a fourth of  sÃ¡wah  lands of the same
relative degree in the scale  In Bengal  according to Mr  Colebrooke s
excellent account of its husbandry   the landlord s proportion of the
crop was one half  two fifths  and a third  according to the difference
of circumstances   The value in money of a crop of rice grown on a
jung  of the best land under the wet cultivation  may amount to one
hundred and sixty Spanish dollars  and on a  bÃ¡hu   the space occupied
by an individual cultivator   forty dollars  I formerly stated the
price of the implements of husbandry  the price of buffaloes or oxen
the expence of building a house  and providing it with the necessary
furniture  The whole farming stock of a villager may be purchased for
about fifteen or sixteen dollars  or for little more than a third part
of the produce of his land in one year  The price of labour  the price
of cattle and of grain  as well as the fertility of the soil  varies in
different parts of the island  but  in general  it may be laid down as
an indisputable proposition  that from the natural bounty of the soil
the peasantry might derive all the means of subsistence and comfort
without any great exertion of ingenuity  or any severity of toil  if
their government made no greater demand than the shares stated above

But besides the rent which the cultivator paid for his land  he was
liable to many more grievous burdens  The great objection to a tax
levied on land  and consisting in a certain share of its produce
arises from the effect that it has in obstructing improvements  but
there were other imposts and contributions exacted from the peasantry
which were positively and immediately oppressive  A ground rent for
houses  called  pachÃºmplang   was prevalent over many parts of the
island  amounting in the provinces subject to the native princes
to one sixth or seventh of a dollar for each dwelling or cottage
The cultivator  in some parts of the country  instead of paying this
tax  was obliged to pay for his fruit trees  In some districts there
was a capitation tax  arbitrary fines were levied in others  and
contributions on the birth or marriage of the children of the superior
regent  or the prince  There were several charges made on the villages
that had a more immediate reference to their own advantage  but which
nevertheless were felt as burdens  such as contributions for the repair
of roads  of bridges  for the making or repair of water courses  dams
and other works necessary for irrigation  Demands on the inhabitants
for charitable and religious objects or institutions are universal
though not very oppressive  Every village has its priest  who depends
upon the contributions of the peasantry for his support  receiving so
much rice or  pÃ¡ri  as his salary  The taxes on the internal trade
of the country extended to every article of manufacture  produce  or
consumption  and being invariably farmed out to Chinese  who employed
every mode of extortion that their ingenuity could invent  or the
passive disposition of the people would allow them to practice
constituted an inexhaustible source of oppression  to these we may add
the feudal services and forced deliveries required under the Dutch
government

The following observations extracted from two reports  the one
on  Bantam   at the western side of the island  and the other on
PasÃºruan   almost at its other extremity  were unhappily by no
means inapplicable to the greatest part of the intermediate space
and contain by no means an exaggerated representation   The holders
of  pÃºsaka  lands in  Bantam  were very seldom the occupants  they
generally remained about court  and on the approach of the  pÃ¡ri
harvest deputed agents to collect their share of the crop  But what
proportion their share would bear to the whole produce does not appear
to be well defined  it is by one stated at a fifth  and by some  which
I suspect to be nearest the truth  at as much as the cultivator could
afford to pay  the agents of the proprietors being the judges of the
quantity  The proprietors of the  pÃºsakas  have also a claim to the
services of the cultivators  a certain number of them are always in
attendance at the houses of their chiefs  and on journies are employed
in carrying their persons and baggage  The lands not  pÃºsaka  used to
pay the same proportion of produce to the Sultan as the others did to
the proprietors  but the cultivators of the royal dominions laboured
under greater disadvantages than the others  Every chief or favourite
about court had authority to employ them in the most menial offices
and chiefs possessing  pÃºsakas   often spared their own people and
employed the others  The Sultan always had a right to enforce the
culture of any article which he thought proper to direct  and  in such
cases  a price was paid upon the produce  which was generally very
inadequate to the expences

It may be very desirable   says Mr  Jourdan  in his report on the
completion of the settlement of  PasÃºruan    that I should mention
a few of the oppressions from which it is the object of the present
system to relieve the people  I cannot but consider the greatest of
these  the extent of the personal service demanded  not only by the
TumÃºng gung  and his family  but the  MÃ¡ntris  and all the petty
chiefs  who had trains of followers that received no stipendiary
recompence  These added to the individuals employed in the coffee
plantations  to which they appear peculiarly averse   in beating out
the rice for the contingent  in cutting grass for and attending the
jÃ¡yang sekÃ¡rs   post carriage and letter carriers  may be calculated
to have employed one fifth of the male population of the working men
Another great source of exaction was the large unwieldy establishment
of  jÃ¡yang sekÃ¡rs   and police officers  the former were liberally
paid  the latter had no regular emoluments  Both these classes
however  quartered themselves freely in whatever part of the country
their functions demanded their attendance  This was equally the case
with any of the Regent s family or petty chiefs who travelled for
pleasure or on duty  Whatever was required for themselves and their
followers  was taken from the poor inhabitants  who have now been so
long accustomed to such practices  that they never dare to complain
or to remonstrate  The European authority did not escape the taint of
corruption  Monopolies  unpaid services  licences  forced or at least
expected presents  were but too common even in the best times  and must
have contributed to estrange the affections and respect of the natives
from that power which should have afforded them protection  From this
faint sketch it will be deduced  that while the men of rank were living
in pampered luxury  the poor provincials were suffering penury and
distress

The Dutch Company  actuated solely by the spirit of gain  and viewing
their Javan subjects with less regard or consideration than a
West India planter formerly viewed the gang upon his estate  because
the latter had paid the purchase money of human property which the
other had not  employed all the pre existing machinery of despotism
to squeeze from the people their utmost mite of contribution  the last
dregs of their labour  and thus aggravated the evils of a capricious
and semi barbarous government  by working it with all the practised
ingenuity of politicians  and all the monopolizing selfishness of
traders

Can it therefore be a subject of surprize  that the arts of agriculture
and the improvement of society  have made no greater advances in Java
Need it excite wonder  that the implements of husbandry are simple
that the cultivation is unskilful and inartificial  that the state
of the roads  where European convenience is not consulted  is bad
that the natural advantages of the country are neglected  that so
little enterprize is displayed or capital employed  that the peasant s
cottage is mean  and that so little wealth and knowledge are among
the agricultural population  when it is considered  that the occupant
of land enjoys no security for reaping the fruits of his industry
when his possession is liable to be taken away from him every season
or to suffer such an enhancement of rent as will drive him from it
when such a small quantity of land only is allowed him as will yield
him bare subsistence  and every ear of grain that can be spared from
the supply of his immediate wants  is extorted from him in the shape
of tribute  when his personal services are required unpaid for  in
the train of luxury or in the culture of articles of monopoly  and
when  in addition to all these discouragements  he is subject to other
heavy imposts and impolitic restraints  No man will exert himself
when acting for another  with so much zeal as when stimulated by his
own immediate interest  and under a system of government  where every
thing but the bare means of subsistence is liable to be seized  nothing
but the means of subsistence will be sought to be attained  The Dutch
accuse the Javans of indolent habits and fraudulent dispositions  but
surely the oppressor has no right to be surprized  that the oppressed
appear reluctant in his service  that they meet his exactions with
evasion  and answer his call to labour with sluggish indifference

The mode of dividing land into minute portions is decidedly favourable
to population  and nothing but those checks to the progress of
agriculture  to which I have referred  could have limited the
population of Java to numbers so disproportioned to its fertility  or
confined the labours of the peasantry to so small a space of what would
reward their industry with abundance  The cultivated ground on the
Island has already been estimated at an eighth part of the whole area
In  ProbolÃ­ng o  and  BesÃºki   the total number of  jungs  of land
amount to 775 483  the total of land capable of superior cultivation
174 675  jungs   while the space actually cultivated amounts only to
13 432  jungs   In  RembÃ¡ng   the land belonging to villages is about
40 000  jungs   and not the half of that quantity is under cultivation
In  PasÃºruan   the same appearances are exhibited  From this last
district the Resident s report on the settlement states  as a reason
for his assessing the same rent on all the land   that the cultivated
part bearing so small a proportion to the uncultivated  the inhabitants
have been enabled to select the most fruitful spots exclusively
hence arises the little variety I have discovered in the produce
ChÃ©ribon   Bantam  the  Priang en  regencies  the eastern corner of
the Island  the provinces under the native governments  and in short
the greatest and most fertile districts  furnish striking illustrations
of this disproportion between the bounty of nature and the inefficient
exertions of man to render her gifts available  to extend population
and to promote human happiness  or rather they supply an example of
unwise institutions and despotic government  counteracting the natural
progress of both

When the British arms prevailed in 1811  the attention of government
was immediately turned to the state and interests of its new subjects
It saw at once the natural advantages of the Island and the causes
which obstructed its prosperity  and it determined to effect those
changes which  having succeeded in Western India  and being sanctioned
by justice and expediency  were likely to improve those advantages and
to remove those obstructions  In consequence of the instructions of
Lord Minto  the Governor General  who was present at the conquest  and
took a great interest in the settlement of the Island  no time was lost
to institute inquiries and to collect information on the state of the
peasantry  and the other points  the knowledge of which was necessary
before any attempt to legislate could be wisely or rationally made  The
following principles  laid down by his Lordship  were those on which
the local government acted

Contingents of rice  and indeed of other productions  have been
hitherto required of the cultivators by government at an arbitrary
rate  this also is a vicious system  to be abandoned as soon as
possible  The system of contingents did not arise from the mere
solicitude for the supply of the people  but was a measure alone of
finance and control  to enable government to derive a revenue from
a high price imposed on the consumer  and to keep the whole body of
the people dependent on its pleasure for subsistence  I recommend a
radical reform in this branch to the serious and early attention of
government  The principle of encouraging industry in the cultivation
and improvements of lands  by creating an interest in the effort and
fruits of that industry  can be expected in Java only by a fundamental
change of the whole system of landed property and tenure  A wide field
but a somewhat distant one  is open to this great and interesting
improvement  the discussion of the subject  however  must necessarily
be delayed till the investigation it requires is more complete  I shall
transmit such thoughts as I have entertained  and such hopes as I have
indulged in this grand object of amelioration  but I am to request
the aid of all the information  and all the lights  that this Island
can afford  On this branch  nothing must be done that is not mature
because the exchange is too extensive to be suddenly or ignorantly
attempted  But fixed and immutable principles of the human character
and of human association  assure me of ultimate  and I hope not remote
success  in views that are consonant with every motive of action that
operate on man  and are justified by the practice and experience of
every flourishing country of the world

In compliance with these instructions  the object of which was embraced
with zeal by the local government  to whom his lordship entrusted the
administration of the Island  a commission was appointed  under the
able direction of Colonel Mackenzie  to prosecute statistic inquiries
the results of which  as corrected and extended by subsequent surveys
will frequently appear in the tables and statistic accounts of this
work  The nature of the landed tenure  and the demand made upon
agriculture  in all the shapes of rent and taxes  were ascertained  the
extortions practised by the Dutch officers  the native princes  the
regents  and the Chinese  were disclosed  the rights of all classes  by
law or usage  investigated  the state of the population  the quantity
and value of cultivated land  of forests  of plantations of cotton
and coffee  the quantity of live stock  and other resources of the
country subject to colonial administration  inquired into and made
known  The result of these inquiries  with regard to landed tenure  I
have given above  and  as it will be seen  it was such as opposed the
rights of no intermediate class between the local government and the
beneficial changes it contemplated in behalf of the great body of the
people  After attaining the requisite information  the course which
expediency  justice  and political wisdom pointed out was not doubtful
and coincided  as in most cases it will be found to do  with the track
which enlightened benevolence  and a zealous desire to promote the
happiness of the people would dictate

The peasant was subject to gross oppression and undefined exaction
our object was to remove his oppressor  and to limit demand to a fixed
and reasonable rate of contribution  He was liable to restraints
on the freedom of inland trade  to personal services and forced
contingents  our object was to commute them all for a fixed and
well known contribution  The exertions of his industry were reluctant
and languid  because he had little or no interest in its fruits  our
object was to encourage that industry  by connecting its exertions with
the promotion of his own individual welfare and prosperity  Capital
could not be immediately created  nor agricultural skill acquired  but
by giving the cultivator a security  that whatever he accumulated would
be for his own benefit  and whatever improvement he made  he or his
family might enjoy it  a motive was held out to him to exert himself
in the road to attain both  Leases  or contracts for fixed rents for
terms of years  in the commencement  and eventually in perpetuity
seemed to be the only mode of satisfying the cultivator  that he would
not be liable  as formerly  to yearly undefined demands  while freedom
from all taxes but an assessment on his crop  or rather a fixed sum
in commutation thereof  would leave him at full liberty to devote the
whole of his attention and labour to render his land as productive as
possible

In conformity with these views  an entire revolution was effected
in the mode of levying the revenue  and assessing the taxes upon
agriculture  The foundation of the amended system was  1st  The
entire abolition of forced deliveries at inadequate rates  and of
all feudal services  with the establishment of a perfect freedom in
cultivation and trade  2d  The assumption  on the part of government
of the immediate superintendence of the lands  with the collection of
the resources and rents thereof  3d  The renting out of the lands so
assumed to the actual occupants  in large or small estates  according
to local circumstances  on leases for a moderate term  In the course of
the following years  1814 and 1815  these measures were carried into
execution in most of the districts under our government  with a view to
the eventual establishment of a perpetual settlement  on the principle
of the  ryotwar   or as it has been termed on Java  the  tiÃ¡ng Ã¡lit
system

The principles of land rental and detailed settlement were few and
simple 48   After mature inquiry  no obstacle appeared to exist
either in law or usage  to the interference of government  in
regulating the condition of the peasantry  and it was resolved
therefore  that it should take into its own hands the management of
that share of the land produce which was allowed to be its due  and
protect the cultivator in the enjoyment and free disposal of the
remainder  The undue power of the chiefs was to be removed  and so far
as they had a claim for support  founded either on former services or
deprivation of expected employment  they were to be remunerated in
another way  The lands  after being surveyed and estimated  were to be
parcelled out among the inhabitants of the villages  in the proportions
established by custom or recommended by expediency  Contracts were to
be entered into with each individual cultivator  who was to become the
tenant of government  and leases specifying the extent and situation
of their land  with the conditions of their tenure  were to be granted
for one or more years  with a view to permanency  if at the end of
the stipulated term  the arrangement should be found to combine
the interest of the public revenue with the welfare and increasing
prosperity of the occupant  If that was not the case  room was thus
left for a new adjustment  for a reduction of rate  or for any change
in the system which might adapt it more to the interests and wishes of
the people  without prejudice to the rights of government

This experiment hazarded nothing  and held out every prospect of
success  it committed no injustice  and compromised no claim  The
peasantry could not suffer  because an assessment less in amount  and
levied in a less oppressive manner than formerly  all rents  taxes
and services included   was required of them  the chiefs could not
complain  because they were allowed the fair emoluments of office
and only restrained from oppressions which did not so much benefit
themselves as injure their inferiors  Most of the latter were not only
allowed an equivalent for their former income  but employed in services
allied to their former duties   the collection of the revenue  and the
superintendence of the police  As the cultivator had acquired rights
which the chief could not violate  as the former held in his possession
a lease with the conditions on which he cultivated his farm  no
infringement of which could be attempted on the part of the latter with
impunity  no evil could result from employing the chiefs in collecting
the revenue of districts  while  from their practical knowledge of
the habits and individual concerns of the peasantry  of the nature
of the seasons and the crops  they were the fittest persons for the
office  For these services it seemed most expedient to pay them  either
by allowing them a certain percentage on their collections  or by
allotting them portions of land rent free  The village constitution
which will be more particularly noticed in treating of the
institutions of the country  was preserved inviolate  and the chiefs or
head men of the villages  in many instances elected by the free will
of the villagers  were invariably continued in office as the immediate
collectors of the rents  and with sufficient authority to preserve the
police  and adjust the petty disputes that might arise within them  the
government scrupulously avoiding all unnecessary interference in the
customs  usages  and details of these societies

In looking at the condition of the peasantry  and in estimating the
fertility of the soil  the wants of the people  and the proportion of
produce and industry that they formerly were accustomed to pay for
supporting the establishments of government  it was thought reasonable
to commute all former burdens into a land rent on a fixed principle
all  sÃ¡wah  lands being estimated by the  pÃ¡ri   or unhusked rice
they could produce  and all  tÃ©gal  lands by their produce in maize
The following  as stated in the eighty third article of the Revenue
Instructions  was considered as the fairest scale for fixing the
government share  and directed to be referred to  as much as possible
as the general standard

                           For  SÃ¡wah  Lands

 1st sort  One half  of the estimated produce
 2d do     Two fifths             ditto
 3d do     One third              ditto

                           For  TÃ©gal  Lands

 1st sort  Two fifths  of the estimated produce
 2d do     One third              ditto
 3d do     One fourth             ditto

Government   it is said in the eighty fifth section   think it
necessary to declare explicitly  that they will be satisfied when
the land revenue shall be productive to them in these proportions
determining at no future period to raise the scale  so that the
inhabitants  being thus exactly acquainted with what will form the
utmost demand on them  and resting in full confidence that government
will not exact any thing further  may in that security enjoy their
possessions in undisturbed happiness  and apply their utmost industry
to the improvement of their lands  assured that  while they conduct
themselves well  that land will never be taken from them  and that the
more productive they can render it  the more beneficial it will be for
themselves

The government share might either be received in money or in kind from
the  sÃ¡wah  lands  but the  tÃ©gal  produce  though estimated in maize
was always  if possible  to be commuted into money at the lowest price
in the market  and as cultivators generally held portions of both  this
rule  it was conceived  could not be considered generally as a hardship

In the first settlement  leases were only granted for a year  or at
the utmost three years  and were given to intermediate renters  but in
the more detailed settlement of 1814  after sufficient information had
been collected on the state of the country  government determined to
act directly with the individual cultivator  and to lay the foundation
of a permanent system  By this latter period  the experiments have been
tried to a certain extent  and had succeeded beyond the most sanguine
expectation  Difficulties met us in the way  but they were by no means
insurmountable  there were at first imperfections in the system  but
they did not affect its principle  and were easily removed  By the
zeal  the ability  and industry of the various officers entrusted with
the execution of the duty  whatever was practicable in furtherance of
the object in which they felt deeply interested  was accomplished  In
the course of the years 1814 and 1815  the new system was introduced
into  Bantam    ChÃ©ribon   and the eastern districts  over a population
of a million and a half of cultivators  not only without disturbance
and opposition  but to the satisfaction of all classes of the natives
and to the manifest increase of the public revenue derivable from land
In several journies which I undertook into the different provinces
for the purposes of examining in person the effect of the progressive
system of reform which I had the happiness to introduce  and of lending
the sanction of official authority to such modifications of it as
local circumstances might render advisable  I was a pleased spectator
of its beneficial tendency  and of the security and satisfaction it
universally diffused  The cultivator  protected against all vexatious
exactions  and no longer at the beck of a tyrannical chief who made
unlimited demands upon his personal services  was beginning to feel
additional stimulants to his industry  to acquire a superior relish
for property  and to acknowledge that government and power were not
always the enemies of the lower ranks of society  or as they modestly
call themselves   the little people  tiang halit    The British
administration of Java  with all its agents  having watched the
progress of the amended system at first with vigilant anxiety  at last
saw it nearly completed with success  and rejoiced in its beneficial
operation on the prosperity  improvement  and happiness of the people
During the two years that we retained possession of the island  after
the greatest part of its arrangements were carried into effect  we had
daily proofs of the amelioration they were producing  The cultivation
was extending  the influence of the chiefs appeared to be progressively
weakening  and the number of crimes  both from the superior industry
of the people now become interested in the result of their labours
and from the contented tranquillity produced by an increase of the
means of subsistence  as well as from the amended system of police
mentioned in another part of this work   was gradually diminishing
Without troubling the reader with further details  I may mention that
in the beginning of December 1815  a few months before I left the
island  not satisfied with my own observation or the vague report of
others  I circulated specific queries to the different residents  on
the comparative state of cultivation in the different provinces  before
the introduction of the detailed settlement  and at the latest date
to which an answer could be returned  and on the comparative number
of crimes at the same two periods  and the return was as gratifying
to humanity and benevolence as it was corroborative of the opinions
previously formed  I shall quote a few extracts from these reports  The
Resident at  ChÃ©ribon   cannot  from certain data  tell what progress
has been made in extending the cultivation of that province  but thinks
it has been considerable   and adds   I have no doubt but that a few
years of the amended system of government would render the district
of  ChÃ©ribon   so notorious for crimes  one of the most flourishing
and valuable in any part of the island   The Resident of  TÃ©gal  is
nearly in similar circumstances with regard to authentic documents
but gives a very favourable opinion  both with regard to the increase
of industry and the reduction of crimes  The return from  KedÃº  is
more definite  it states a positive increase of  tÃ©gal  land to the
amount of thirty six  jungs   but a much greater increase of produce
from improved culture  The revenue afforded a sufficient proof of the
latter fact  The same favourable account is given of the state of
police and the diminution of crime  No data are given in the report
from  PakalÃ¡ng an  to ascertain the additional quantity of rice lands
brought into cultivation  but an opinion is expressed  that it has
increased  and an assurance is afforded  that the culture of indigo
and tobacco has sensibly extended  As an evidence that the means of
subsistence are raised in greater abundance than formerly  their price
has very considerably diminished

A commission which was appointed to inquire into the state of the
revenue  report from  JapÃ¡ra  the great facility there was in
collecting the revenue under the amended system  and certify its
beneficial effects in extending cultivation  securing tranquillity
promoting industry  and diminishing crimes  The same commission
conclude their report of  GrÃ©sik  with similar assurances of the happy
results of the revenue  and judicial arrangements for the prosperity
of that province  The Resident of  RembÃ¡ng  gives an increase of
cultivation of fifty two  jungs  of  sÃ¡wah  and about thirteen of
tÃ©gal  land  and accounts for the smallness of this increase from
the comparative sterility of the soil  and the precarious supply of
water  Indigo had not increased  but tobacco had to a great degree  The
vigilance of the police  and the ameliorating effects of the revenue
settlement  are seen  it is said  in the improved state of morals  In
SurabÃ¡ya  it is stated  that during the time the amended system had
been in action  there had been an increase of three hundred and twenty
government  jungs   making upwards of two thousand English acres  In
the residency of  PasÃºruan  there is an increase of cultivation to
the amount of three hundred and six  jungs   this  however  does not
comprehend the whole advantage that the new system produced in that
province  for industry had been so much promoted by it  as to obtain
two crops within the year  on many of the lands where the cultivator
was formerly content with one  It is needless to enter into any further
particulars  to shew the advantages of the regulations adopted with
regard to the settlement of the landed revenue

By a steady adherence to a system which  even in its origin  was
productive of such fruits  by continuing to the peasant the protection
of laws made for his benefit  by allowing full scope to his industry
and encouraging his natural propensity to accumulate  agriculture on
Java would soon acquire a different character  it would soon become
active and enterprising  there would soon be created a difference
in farms and in the circumstances of individuals  capital would be
fixed and augmented in the hands of the skilful and the industrious
among the cultivators  the idle and the indifferent would relinquish
their possessions in their favour  roads  intercourse  and markets
would be increased  the organization of society would be changed
and an improved race would shew themselves  in some measure  worthy
of the most fertile region of the globe  What Egypt and Sicily were
in different ages to the south of Europe  Java might become to the
south of Asia and the Indian Archipelago  From the exertion with which
the British government endeavoured to lay the foundation of such
improvements  at first amid the embarrassments of a recent conquest
and latterly with the prospect of only an intermediate possession  from
the attachment it cherished for a people whose gratitude it deserved
and acquired  and from the interest that every friend of humanity must
feel in the anticipation of seeing this highly favoured island  the
metropolis  the granary  and the centre of civilization to the vast
regions between the coast of China and the Bay of Bengal  it might
have been expected  that those who were instrumental in introducing
the late arrangements  should watch with peculiar anxiety the first
movements of the power to which the colony was transferred  and should
look into the regulations for its Indian empire for the support  or
the death blow  of the most animating hopes  It must therefore be
with peculiar satisfaction that we see  with regard to the freedom of
cultivation  the Dutch government sanctions what we had done  and gives
our regulations permanency by embodying them in its colonial policy
In articles seventy eight and seventy nine of the fundamental laws for
the civil  judicial  and mercantile administration of India 49   we
find the following enactments   The free cultivation of all articles of
produce which may be raised in the possessions of the state in India
is granted to the inhabitants of these possessions  with the exception
of cloves  nutmegs  and opium  and without prejudice to the regulations
which might be adopted concerning the contingents and forced
deliveries  which on a resumption of these possessions out of the hands
of the English  will be found to be continued in force  All the fruits
of cultivation raised within the possessions of the states beyond the
forced deliveries  and every kind of produce not comprehended under
the exceptions mentioned above  are to be the lawful property of the
cultivator  The free unrestrained disposal thereof belongs to him of
right  as soon as the land rent assessed thereon  either in kind or
money  shall be paid  It is the duty of the Indian administration to
maintain him in these rights   Let him be maintained in those rights
and the Dutch government will realize a revenue far beyond the amount
of their former assessments  without  as formerly  disgracing the
Europeans in the eyes of the Asiatic  by their weakness  corruption
and injustice

FOOTNOTES

46  See Treaties of the Dutch with the Native Princes

47  This article has never been a contingent or forced delivery with
the Dutch  and its extensive cultivation in the district of Kedu
gives a proof of what the natives will do if not interfered with by
European monopoly  The  KedÃº  is  in consequence of this cultivation
by far the richest province in the island  giving an annual revenue
to the government  in money  of half a million of rupees  This
important district was never subjected to the Dutch government  it was
transferred to the British in 1812  and immediately fell under the
Revenue System

48  These principles were contemplated as just and practicable by a
Dutch authority  Van Hogendorp  who resided on Java  and criticized
freely the measures of administration  as will appear from the
following extracts from a work  which only came into my possession
subsequently to the introduction of the new system by the British
government   Property of the soil must be introduced by granting all
the cultivated lands to those who have hitherto cultivated them  or
in other words  to the common Javans  All the rice fields belonging
to each  dÃ©sa  should be distributed among its inhabitants  and the
gardens or spots of ground in which their cottages stand  should
also  in future  be their personal property  Correct registers hereof
should be kept  and certificates given to the different owners  Who
can produce a better and nearer right to the personal possession of
the land  than he who has cultivated and made it productive  And is
there a country in the world where the natives are happy  free  and
well settled  without having a property in the soil  Our own country
and all the kingdoms of Europe  afford the most direct proofs of this
they flourish in proportion as property is more or less secure and
equally divided among the inhabitants of each  All Europe groaned under
the feudal system of government  all Europe has freed itself from it
but by various means and in different degrees  Why  therefore  can
similar changes not be brought about on Java  Every thing urges us to
make them  and the results must be important and most advantageous
to us  Java is alone able to relieve our commonwealth from all its
difficulties

In order to collect a land tax properly  a general and correct survey
should  in the first instance  be effected in all the districts
belonging to us  according to an established land measure  to be
introduced generally throughout Java  for this is  at present  very
irregular  All the lands should then be divided into three classes
first  second  and third class  according to the proportionate
fertility of the soil  and according to the same proportion the
land tax should be established  I am very ready to admit  that this
will naturally be difficult and troublesome  but what system of
government is exempt from these inconveniences  and particularly in
this country  where it is necessary to effect a radical change and
reform  in order to produce any beneficial results  But with diligence
zeal  and deliberation  all difficulties may be overcome  and even
should the survey not be exactly correct in the first instance  it
might be improved from year to year  The word  jung  is now used by
the Javans for a certain measure of land  but this differs so much in
different districts  that it is impossible to ascertain how many square
roods of land a  jung  ought to contain  The name might be retained
however  after having found by experience how many square roods  in
general or on an average  are contained in a  jung   the proportion
might be once for all established  introduced throughout the island
and fixed as the regular land measure of the country  It would be
difficult  and as yet unnecessary  to calculate how many  jungs  of
land our territories on Java contain  and how much might be collected
as a land tax from each  jung   in order to ascertain what this tax
would amount to  I think it should be taken as a principle  that the
land tax can and ought to produce as much as the head money   namely
a rix dollar per head   the land tax would then yield an annual and
certain income of at least two millions and a half of rix dollars
Every spot of cultivated ground being measured and settled to which
class it belongs  every owner will correctly know  how much he must
pay for land tax annually  and be completely at liberty to plant his
land with whatever he may prefer  and may conceive most conducive to
his advantage  I am of opinion  that during the first years it would
be difficult  on account of the scarcity of specie  or rather its
absence from circulation  to collect the land tax  but  in the same
way as with the head money  it would be expedient  in the first years
to be somewhat indulgent in the collection  or else to receive produce
in lieu of money  which might be done in this tax better than the
capitation  But after five years of good administration  I am certain
that the land tax would be fully and without difficulty collected

   Ship building  Paper  Salt  Saltpetre Works  Gunpowder
    c   Felling and Transporting of Teak Timber  Fisheries


It is here proposed to state the progress made by the Javans in a few
of the common arts and handicrafts  and in one or two of the more
extensive manufactures  their docility in working under European
direction  and some other observations  which could not be so
appropriately placed in any other part of this work  I have already
had occasion to notice the limited skill and simple contrivances with
which they carry on the labours of agriculture  and prepare the produce
of the soil for consumption  in the various ways that their taste or
their habits require  In a country like Java  where the structure of
society is simple  and the wants of the people are few  where there
is no accumulation of capital and little division of professions  it
cannot be expected that manufacturing skill should be acquired  or
manufacturing enterprize encouraged  to any great extent  The family of
a Javan peasant is almost independent of any labour but that of its own
members  The furniture  the clothing  and almost every article required
for a family  being prepared within its own precincts  no extensive
market of manufactured commodities is necessary for the supply of the
island itself  and for foreign trade  the produce of their soil is more
in demand than the fruits of their skill or industry  In a country
where nature is bountiful  and where so much of her bounty can be
collected with so little labour to pay for manufactures from abroad
there is but little encouragement to withdraw the natives from the
rice field  the forest  or the coffee garden  to the loom  the forge
or the workshop  and it is not in this respect  certainly  that a
change of their habits would be beneficial  This short notice of Javan
manufactures  therefore  must be very limited  both in the number of
the articles that it embraces  and in the importance that Europeans may
attach to them  for Java can neither send us porcelain  like China  nor
silks  shawls  and cottons  like Western India  To a nation  however
so much accustomed as we are to the exertions of manufacturing skill
and perfection of manufacturing machinery  it may not be uninteresting
to see the simple means  by which a half civilized people accomplish
the objects which we attain by such expeditious and ingenious
processes  The most experienced naval architect may be interested by
the manner in which a savage scoops his canoe

The Javans have names in their language for most of the handicrafts
The following enumeration of terms applied to trades and professions
will shew the extent to which the division of labour is sometimes
carried  while the foreign extraction of some of them may  perhaps
serve to point out the source whence they were derived

I shall proceed to describe a few of the manufactures of the island
without attending much to the order in which it might be proper to
arrange them  The construction of a habitation is among the first
and most necessary arts of uncivilized man  as the perfection of
architecture is one of the most convincing proofs and striking
illustrations of a high state of refinement  I have already described
the hut of the peasant  and have mentioned that it is generally
constructed of wood  Such structures suit the climate of the country
and save the labour of the people  but they are not rendered necessary
by an ignorance of more durable materials

Bricks are manufactured in almost every part of the island  being
generally employed in the better sort of buildings  not only by
Europeans and Chinese  but by the natives of rank  The quality of the
clay varies greatly in different districts  It is all obtained from the
decomposition of the basaltic stones  and possesses different degrees
of purity  according to the proportion and nature of the other earths
which are adventitiously mixed with it  In some parts of the island it
is very pure  and might be advantageously employed in the manufacture
of porcelain  but the natives are unacquainted with the principles of
this art  some instruction in the glazing of their pottery would be of
very general benefit  They are unacquainted with the process of making
glass

Cut stones are  at present  but rarely used by the Javans  and
stone cutting is almost exclusively performed by the Chinese  But
although the Javans do not  at present  possess or practice any
considerable skill in this art  the extensive remains of edifices
constructed in stone  and of idols carved from the same materials
afford abundant testimony that the arts of architecture  sculpture
and statuary in stone  at one period reached to a very high pitch on
Java  As  however  these arts have long been lost to the Javans  the
consideration of them rather falls within the department of antiquities
than that which we are now upon

In the vicinity of  GrÃ©sik  there are several hills composed of a soft
white stone  which hardens on exposure to the air  Stones are here
cut in the quarry into regular squares of various sizes  from that of
a brick to the largest tomb stone  They are principally required for
the latter purpose  and in the cemeteries of  GrÃ©sik  and  MadÃºra  the
inscriptions upon them are very neatly executed  Beyond this  the skill
of the natives in stone cutting does not at present pretend

The covering of the native houses is generally of thatch  In the
maritime districts   Ã¡tap   or thatch  is made almost exclusively
from the leaves of the  nÃ­pa  or  bÃºyu   In the preparation  the
leaflets separated from the common petiol are employed  Being doubled
they are attached close to each other on a stick of three feet in
length  and when thus arranged are placed on the roof  like shingles
or tiles  The leaves of the  gÃ©bang   on account of their fan like
form  are differently arranged  they constitute large mats  which are
chiefly employed for sides of houses or for composing temporary sheds
but they are too large and brittle to form durable  Ã¡tap   In the
interior districts  where  nÃ­pa  does not grow  the houses are almost
uniformly thatched with a species of long grass called  alang alang
the  lÃ¡lang  of the Malay countries   Near large forests  where bÃ¡mbu
abounds  the natives cover their houses with this reed  The leaflets
of the cocoa nut cannot be made into thatch  but wherever the sago and
nÃ­pa  grow  it is made from their leaflets

An article of household furniture in use among all classes  and
displaying in some cases considerable beauty and delicacy of execution
is matting  Mats are made from several species of pandanus  from a kind
of grass called  mÃ¡ndong   and from the leaves of various palms  A
species of the latter affords the most common kinds  coarser and less
durable than others  as well as bags  straw sacks  resembling coarse
mats  the leaves being divided into laminÃ¦  about one line in breadth
are woven in the same manner and on the same frames as coarse linen
These fibres  called  Ã¡gel   are sometimes manufactured into twine
which possesses but little strength  The mats or bags  called  kÃ¡rong
are much inferior to the gunny bags of India

The coarsest kinds of mats  employed chiefly by the lower class  are
called in the central districts  klÃ³so bÃ³ngko   those prepared from
grass   klÃ³so mÃ¡ndong   and the others   klÃ³so psÃ¡ntrem   from the
place where they are made   The materials of all these are plaited by
hand  The  klÃ³so psÃ¡ntrem  are of superior quality  and in use through
the central and eastern parts of the island  especially among the
natives of the first class  with whom they constitute the principal
furniture of the dwelling house  A person of the highest rank aspires
to no luxury  more delicate or expensive in this way  than the
possession of a bed composed of mats from  psÃ¡ntrem

A kind of umbrella hat worn by the common people  and universal in the
SÃºnda districts denominated  chÃ¡peng   is also manufactured in this
manner  principally from  bÃ¡mbu   dyed of various colours  which being
shaped in the form and of the size of a large wash hand basin worn
reversed  is rendered impervious to the wet by one or more coverings of
varnish

A great part of the manufacturing ingenuity of every people must be
displayed in collecting the materials  or arranging the fabrics of
those articles of clothing  required for protection  decency  or
ornament  Whether these materials are derived from the fleece  the fur
or the feathers of the larger animals  from the covering of an insect
the bark of a tree  or the down of a shrub  they have to undergo
several laborious and expensive processes before they are fit for use
and in conducting these processes  or forming machinery for rendering
them more expeditious  complete  and easy  the superior manufacturing
skill of one nation over another is chiefly evinced  The sheep on Java
as in all tropical climates  loses its fleece before it can be used
with advantage  The silk worm has never succeeded  although no reason
can be given why it should not  and therefore the chief material of
Javan clothing is cotton

Cotton  in its rough state  is called  kÃ¡pas   and when cleaned
kÃ¡pok   The process of separating the seeds is performed by means of
a  gilÃ­ng an   which is a roller  consisting of two wooden cylinders
revolving in opposite directions  between which the fibre is made to
pass  This operation is very tedious  two days being necessary for
one person to clean a  kÃ¡ti   equivalent to a pound and a quarter
English  After the separation of the seed  it is  gÃ©blek   or beaten
with a rattan  and  pÃ­ndi  or picked  The finer sort is then bowed
after the Indian manner  this operation is called  wusÃ³ni   The cotton
thus prepared is afterwards pulled out and drawn round a stick  when
it is called  pÃºsuh   To perform the process upon a single  kÃ¡ti  will
employ one person about two days  The cotton is now ready for spinning
  ngÃ¡nti    and requires ten additional days  labour of one person  to
convert the small quantity above mentioned into yarn  when the result
is found to be three  tukal   or hanks  of the ordinary kind

Previous to the operation of weaving  the yarn is boiled  and
afterwards dressed and combed with rice water  When dry  it is wound
round a sort of reel  termed   Ã­ngan   and prepared for weaving  These
are the last operations it undergoes till it is put into the hands of
the weaver  and requires  in ordinary circumstances  three days for
its completion  Four days are required even by an expert weaver  and
five or six by an ordinary one  to manufacture a  sÃ¡rong   or piece of
cloth  a fathom and a half long and five spans broad  equal to three
square handkerchiefs of the ordinary size worn on the head   The cloths
thus prepared  while uncoloured  are distinguished by the term  lÃ¡won

The spinning wheel is termed  jÃ¡ntra   and the spindle  kÃ­si   The
loom  with all its apparatus  is called  Ã¡bah Ã¡bah tenÃºn   the shuttle
trÃ³pong   the woof  mÃ¡ni   and the warp  pÃ¡kan   Both machines
resemble those described on the continent of India  but are neater
and much better made  the loom especially is more perfect  the
weaver  instead of sitting in holes dug in the ground  invariably
sits on a raised flooring  generally in front of the house  her legs
being stretched out horizontally under the loom  The price of the
spinning wheel varies from less than half a rupee to a rupee  and
that of the loom from a rupee to a Spanish dollar  The operations of
spinning and weaving are confined exclusively to the women  who from
the highest to the lowest rank  prepare the cloths of their husbands
and their families

Coloured cottons   jÃ¡rit   are distinguished into  lÃºri  or  lÃºri
gÃ­ng gang   those in which the yarn is dyed previously to weaving  and
bÃ¡tik   those which are dyed subsequently  The process of weaving the
former is similar to that of the gingham  which it resembles  and need
not therefore be detailed  but the latter  being peculiar to Java  may
deserve a more particular description

The cloths termed  bÃ¡tik  are distinguished into  bÃ¡tik lÃ¡tur pÃºti
bÃ¡tik lÃ¡tur Ã­rang   or  bÃ¡tik lÃ¡tur bang   as the ground may be either
white  black  or red  The white cloth is first steeped in rice water
in order to prevent the colour with which the patterns are intended
to be drawn  from running  and when they are dried and smoothed
calendered   commences the process of the  bÃ¡tik   which gives its
name  This is performed with hot wax in a liquid state  contained
in a small and light vessel  either of copper or silver  called
chÃ¡nt ing   50  holding about an ounce  and having a small tube of
about two inches long  through which the liquid wax runs out in a small
stream  This tube  with the vessel to which it is attached  being fixed
on a stick about five inches long  is held in the hand  and answers
the purpose of a pencil  the different patterns being traced out on
both sides of the cloth with the running wax  When the outline of the
pattern is thus finished  such parts of the cloth as are intended to
be preserved white  or to receive any other colour than the general
field or ground  are carefully covered in like manner with the liquid
wax  and then the piece is immersed in whatever coloured dye may be
intended for the ground of the pattern  To render the colour deeper
cloths are occasionally twice dipped  The parts covered with wax resist
the operation of the dye  and when the wax is removed  by being steeped
in hot water till it melts  are found to remain in their original
condition  If the pattern is only intended to consist of one colour
besides white  the operation is here completed  if another colour is
to be added  the whole of the first ground  which is not intended to
receive an additional shade  is covered with wax  and a similar process
is repeated

In order to render the dye fixed and permanent for the scarlet or
blood red colour  the cloth is previously steeped in oil  and after
five days washed in hot water  and prepared in the usual way for the
bÃ¡tik   In the ordinary course  the process of the  bÃ¡tik  occupies
about ten days for common patterns  and from fifteen to seventeen for
the finer and more variegated

A very coarse kind of cloth  which serves for curtains or hangings
is variously clouded  and covered sometimes with rude figures  by the
art of colouring the yarn  so as to produce this effect when woven
For this purpose  the strands of the yarn being distributed in lengths
equal to the intended size of the cloth  are folded into a bundle
and the parts intended to remain white are so tightly twisted round
and round  that the dye cannot penetrate or affect them  From this
party coloured yarn the designed pattern appears on weaving  The cloths
so dyed are called  gebÃ©r

The sashes of silk  called  chÃ­ndi   are dyed in this manner  as well
as an imitation of them in cotton  called  jÃ³ng grong

Of the several kinds of coloured cottons and silks there is a very
great diversity of patterns  particularly of the  bÃ¡tik   of which
not less than a hundred are distinguished by their appropriate names
Among these are the patterns exclusively worn by the sovereign  termed
bÃ¡tik pÃ¡rang rÃºsa   and  bÃ¡tik sÃ¡wat   and others which designate the
wearer  and are more or less esteemed  as well on this account as their
comparative beauty of design and execution

With the exception of blue and scarlet or blood red  all the dyes of
the inhabitants are liable to fade  and the processes offer nothing
worthy of investigation or remark

In dying blue  indigo  the palm wine of the  Ã¡ren   and various
vegetable acids are employed

Black is obtained from an exotic bark called  tÃ­ng i   and the rind of
the  mangustin  fruit  In making the inferior infusion for this and for
various other dyes  the chaff of rice  called  merÃ¡ng   is employed

In dying green  a light blue is first induced  which is afterwards
converted into the requisite hue  by infusion in a decoction of
tegrÃ¡ng   an exotic wood   to which blue vitriol is added

TegrÃ¡ng  alone affords a yellow colour  and generally is qualified by
receiving the addition of some bark of the  nÃ¡ngka  and  plem dodÃ³l

A beautiful and lasting scarlet and blood red is obtained from the
roots of the  wÃ³ng kudu   The yarn or cloth is first boiled in the
oil of  wijen  or  kamÃ­ri   being washed in a decoction of  merÃ¡ng
or burnt  pÃ¡ri  chaff  it is dried  and subsequently immersed in
an infusion of the roots of  wÃ³ng kudu   the strength of which is
increased by the addition of the bark  jÃ­rak   a variety of the
fruit  kepÃºndung   In the preparation of this dye  the roots of the
wÃ³ng kudu  are bruised and well mixed with water  which is then boiled
until it is reduced to one third  when it is fit for use  No light red
or rose colour of durability is produced by the Javans  they employ for
this purpose the  kasomba kling

In several of the maritime districts  the  MalÃ¡yus  impart a beautiful
crimson colour to silk  by means of the  gÃºmlak tembÃ¡lu  or  embÃ¡lu
but with this Javans are unacquainted

The  kÃ¡pas jÃ¡wa   or Java cotton  in its raw and uncleaned state costs
from about three halfpence to three pence the  kÃ¡ti   according to
its quality  and the  kÃ¡pas mÃºri  from six to eight pence  The price
of each advances sometimes fifty per cent  beyond this  when the
production is scarce or out of season

A  kÃ¡ti  of uncleaned Java cotton is calculated to produce two and a
half  tÃºkul  or hanks of coarse  and three and a half hanks of fine
yarn  and a  kÃ¡ti  of  kÃ¡pas mÃºri   five hanks of the latter  The value
of the former is from three to four pence  and of the latter from seven
to ten

Three hanks and a half of coarse yarn  and from five to nine of fine
make one  sÃ¡rong   or three head handkerchiefs  the price of which
undyed  is from half a rupee to four Spanish dollars  if dyed  the
ging ams  bring from one rupee to four Spanish dollars  and the
bÃ¡tik  from a rupee and a half to six Spanish dollars for the same
quantity

Another kind of coloured cottons  in imitation of the Indian chintz  is
also prepared  but it is not held in much estimation  on account of the
superiority of the foreign chintzes imported  and the uncertainty of
the colours  which the natives allege will not stand in the same manner
as those which have undergone the process of the  batÃ®k   frequently
fading in the second washing  In these cloths  the patterns being
carved on small wooden blocks are stamped as in India  They serve as
coverlids  and are employed as a substitute for the Indian palempore
when the latter is not procurable  The price is about four rupees

The natives of Java  like those of every other country  must have been
from the earliest times  in the habit of manufacturing various articles
of leather  but the art of rendering it more compact  more tough  and
more durable  by the application of the tanning principle  has been
acquired only by their connexion with Europeans  They now practice it
with considerable success  and prepare tolerable leather in several
districts  There are two trees of which the bark is particularly
preferred for tanning  one in the maritime districts  the other in the
interior  These  with some others which are occasionally added  contain
very large quantities of the tanning principle  which makes excellent
leather in a short space of time  Of this native article  boots  shoes
saddles  harness   c  are made in several parts of the island  but in
the greatest perfection at  SÃºra kÃ©rta   where the prices are moderate
and the manufacture extensive and improving  Neither the leather nor
the workmanship of these articles is considered much inferior to what
is procured at Madras and Bengal  The prices are moderate  for a pair
of shoes half a crown  for boots ten shillings  for a saddle from
thirty to forty shillings  and for a set of harness for four horses
from ten to twelve pounds

Neither flax nor hemp is cultivated for the purposes of manufacture
The latter is sometimes found in the gardens of the natives of
continental India  particularly at Batavia  who employ it only to
excite intoxication  but the island affords various productions  the
fibrous bark of which is made into thread  ropes  and other similar
articles  These are  with one or two exceptions  never cultivated  and
when required for use  may be collected in sufficient quantity on spots
where they are of spontaneous growth  A particular account of these has
already been given in the first chapter  when describing the vegetable
productions of the island

To enable rope or cord which is often exposed to water or moisture  as
fishing nets  cables  and the like  to resist its influence  the sap
exuding from various trees is employed

No manufactures are calculated to show more clearly the extent to
which the arts of life are carried in a country  than those in which
the metals are used  Without the knowledge of iron  our dominion
over nature would be very limited  as may be seen in the case of the
Americans at the discovery of the western hemisphere  The manufacture
and use of iron and steel has been known over the Eastern Islands
as well as in the western world  from time immemorial  The various
iron implements of husbandry  the common implements and tools  the
instruments and military weapons now in use among the natives of these
regions  are fabricated by themselves  The importance and difficulty of
the art may be gathered from the distinction which the knowledge and
practice of it conferred

The profession of a smith is still considered honourable among the
Javans  and in the early parts of their history  such artizans held
a high rank  and were largely endowed with lands  The first mention
made of them is during the reign of the chiefs of  PajajÃ¡ran   in the
eleventh century  On the decline of that empire they went over  to
the number of eight hundred families  to  MajapÃ¡hit   where they were
kindly received  and a record is preserved of the names of the head
master smiths  On the destruction of that empire in the fifteenth
century  they were dispersed  and settled in different districts of
the island  where their descendants are still discoverable  They are
distinguished by the term  PÃ¡ndi

Iron is cast in small quantities of a few ounces  and used occasionally
for the point of the ploughshare  The metal is rendered fluid in about
half an hour  charcoal is invariably used  and the operation is termed
sing i  or  chitak

The bellows  which is peculiar  and believed to have been in use at
the time of  PajajÃ¡ran  and  MajapÃ¡hit   and of which a representation
sculptured in stone was found in the recently discovered ruins at
Suku   which bear date in the fourteenth century of the Javan Ã¦ra
appears to be the same as that described by Dampier 51   in his account
of  MajindÃ¡nao  and the neighbouring islands   Their bellows   says
this faithful and intelligent traveller   are much different from ours
They are made of a wooden cylinder  the trunk of a tree  about three
feet long  bored hollow like a pump  and set upright on the ground  on
which the fire itself is made  Near the lower end there is a small hole
in the side of the trunk next the fire  made to receive a pipe  through
which the wind is driven by a great bunch of fine feathers fastened
to one end of the stick  which closing up the inside of the cylinder
drives the air out of the cylinder through the pipe  Two of these
trunks or cylinders are placed so nigh together  that a man standing
between them may work them both at once  alternately  one with each
hand   This account so exactly corresponds with the Javan bellows  that
no further description is necessary  The Chinese bellows are partially
used  The wages of a man skilled in iron work are sometimes as high as
a rupee a day

Cutlery of every description is made by the smith  The most important
manufacture of this kind is the  krÃ­s   or dagger  of the peculiar form
well known to be worn by all the more civilized inhabitants of the
Eastern Islands

The price of a  krÃ­s  blade  newly manufactured  varies from half
a rupee to fifty dollars  but the same  krÃ­s   if it is of good
character  and if its descent can be traced for three or four
generations  is frequently prized at ten times that sum  A  pÃ¡ndi
employed to manufacture a good  krÃ­s  blade  if the materials are
furnished  is paid three dollars for the job

The manufacture of sheaths or scabbards   sÃ¡rong   for the krÃ­s
constitute an exclusive profession  and the manufacturers are called
tÃºkang merÃ¡ng gi   or  mergÃ³ngso   These men attend at the public
market  where they occupy a particular quarter  in which may be seen
people employed in the finishing or repair of every part of the
mounting necessary for this instrument  some upon the handle  others
upon the sheath  some in applying the paint and lacquer  others
attending with a preparation of acids and arsenic for cleaning the
blade  and bringing out the appearance of the  pÃ¡mur   a white metal
obtained from  Biliton  and Celebes  which is worked up with the iron
in order to produce the damasked appearance of the blade

Copper is manufactured into the kettles and pots employed by the
natives for cooking  most of the other domestic vessels are of brass
which is manufactured into various other articles  from the smallest
such as buttons  ear studs  and other ornaments  in imitation of the
gold patterns  to brass guns of considerable calibre  employed for
the defence of small vessels  A very extensive foundery of this kind
is established at  GrÃ©sik   From the specimen of the casts in brass
copper   c  which are occasionally dug up near many of the ruinous
temples sacred to the ancient worship of the country  we may assert
that great proficiency was once attained in this art  like that
however  of stone cutting  it has very much declined

Gold and silver  as is well known  are wrought by the natives of the
Eastern Islands into exquisite ornaments  and the Javans are by no
means behind their neighbours  the Sumatrans  in the knowledge of this
manufacture  They do not  however  usually work the gold into those
beautiful filigree patterns  described as common among the  MalÃ¡yus  on
Sumatra  nor is their work generally so fine

Diamond cutters  and persons skilled in the knowledge of cutting
precious stones  are also to be found in the principal capitals

Carving in wood is followed as a particular profession  and the Javans
may be considered as expert in all kinds of carpenter s work  but
more particularly in cabinet work  They imitate any pattern  and the
furniture used by the Europeans in the eastern part of the Island is
almost exclusively of their workmanship  Carriages and other vehicles
are also manufactured by the natives after the European fashion

Boat and ship building is an art in which the Javans are tolerably well
versed  particularly the former  The latter is confined principally
to those districts in which the Europeans have built ships  for the
Javans have seldom attempted the construction of square rigged vessels
on their own account  The best carpenters for ship building are found
in the districts of  RembÃ¡ng  and  GrÃ©sik   but small native vessels
and boats are continually constructed by the natives in almost every
district along the north coast

When the quantity of teak timber  and the advantages of Java in respect
of ports and harbours  are considered  the most flattering prospects
are held out  that this Island may  in time  be able to supply
shipping to an increasing commerce of its own  and perhaps aid the
dock yards of other states

Among the articles  the making of which may be interesting to
Europeans  from the difference of the materials used or the process
employed  is that of paper  The paper in common use with the Javans
is prepared from the  glÃºga   morus papyrifera  which is cultivated
for this purpose  and generally called the  delÃºwang   or paper tree
Having arrived at the age of two or three years  the young trees are
cut while the bark easily peels off  and the fragments are portioned
about twelve or eighteen inches in length  according to the intended
size of the paper  These fragments are first immersed in water about
twenty four hours  in order that the epidermis may be separated  this
being effected  the fibrous tissue of the inner bark is rendered soft
and tractable by soaking in water  and by long and repeated beating
with a piece of wood  During the intervals of this process  the
fragments of the bark are piled in heaps in wooden troughs  and the
affusion of fresh water is repeated till all impurities are carried
off  The separate portions  which are about two or three inches broad
are then attached to each other on a plane surface  generally formed by
the trunk of a plantain tree  and the union of the fibres is finally
effected by continued beating  The quality of the paper depends upon
the care employed in the preparation  and on the frequent affusion of
fresh water  By applying successive layers to the spots which are bare
from the defect of the fibres  and beating them till they unite  an
uniform thickness is attained  The paper which is intended for writing
is momentarily immersed in a decoction of rice  and rendered smooth and
equal  by being rubbed to a polish on a plane surface  Such paper as is
intended for common domestic purposes  for packing goods   c  does not
require this operation  in this the fibrous contexture of the bark is
quite obvious  it much resembles a species of paper brought from Japan
and manufactured from the same tree  and was formerly employed instead
of cloth by the poorer inhabitants  The process of manufacturing is
strikingly like that in use among the inhabitants of the South Sea
Islands  for the preparation of their cloth  The culture of this plant
as well as the manufacture of paper  is chiefly confined to particular
districts  where it forms the principal occupation of the priests  who
gain a livelihood by it

Large quantities of a coarse and homely sugar  distinguished by the
name of Javan sugar  are prepared from the cocoa nut   Ã¡ren   and other
palms  The average quantity of liquor extracted from one of these trees
during a day and night  is about two quarts  and this is estimated to
give from three to four ounces of sugar  The trees begin to yield it
at about six or seven years of age  and continue to do so for ten or
twelve years  The process of preparing the sugar is extremely simple
it consists merely in boiling the liquor in an earthen pot for a few
hours  and afterwards pouring it into small cases made of leaves
and prepared for the purpose  in which  when cool  it attains a due
consistence

Sugar from the cane is manufactured by the Chinese alone  the process
followed resembles that of the West Indies  The juice is expressed
between two rollers  sometimes turned by a water wheel  but in all
cases the machinery is rude and imperfect  The quality of the sugar
made on Java is considered to be equal to that of Manilla and the West
Indies  it contains as much of the saccharine principle as the latter
and is brought to a drier state  It differs from the sugar of Bengal
as much in its quality as in the mode of preparing it  but can be
brought to market at about the same price  Considerable quantities are
sent to the Malabar coast  but the principal exportation is to Japan
and Europe

The manufactory of Batavian arrack  the superior quality of which
is well known  is also conducted by the Chinese  the process is as
follows  About seventy pounds of  kÃ©tan   glutinous rice  is heaped
up in a small vat  round this heap or pile one hundred cans of water
are poured  and on the top twenty cans of molasses  After remaining
two days in this vat  the ingredients are shifted to a larger vat
adjoining  when they receive the addition of four hundred cans of water
and one hundred cans of molasses

Thus far the process is carried on in the open air  In a separate vat
within doors  forty cans of palm wine or toddy from the cocoa nut tree
are immediately mixed with nine hundred cans of water and one hundred
and fifty cans of molasses  Both preparations being allowed to remain
in this state for two days  the former of these preparations is carried
to a still larger vat within doors  and the latter being in a vat
placed above  is poured upon it  through a hole bored for the purpose
near the bottom  In this state the preparation is allowed to ferment
for two days  when it is poured into small earthen jars  containing
about twenty cans each  in which it remains for the further period of
two days  it is then distilled

The liquor drops into a tin vessel under ground  from whence it is
ladled into receiving vessels  This is the third or common sort of
arrack  which by a second distillation in a smaller still  with the
addition of a small quantity of water  becomes the second sort  and
by a third distillation  what is called the first sort  The third or
common sort is called by the Chinese  sÃ­chew   the second  tÃ¡npo   and
the first  kÃ­ji   the two latter being distinguished as arrack  Ã¡pi
When cooled  it is poured into large vats in the storehouses  where it
remains till it is convenient to put it into casks

The whole process  therefore  to the completion of the first sort  does
not require more than ten days  six hours being sufficient for the
original preparation to pass through the first still  The receivers of
the stills are of copper  and the worm consists of about nine turns of
Banka tin

The proof of sufficient fermentation is obtained by placing a lighted
taper about six inches above the surface of the liquor in the
fermenting vat  if the process is sufficiently advanced  the fixed air
rises and extinguishes the light

To ascertain the strength of the spirit  a small quantity of it is
burnt in a saucer  and the residuum measured  The difference between
the original quantity and the residuum gives the measure of the alcohol
lost

Among the most important manufactures of Java  both viewed in its
relation to the comforts of the inhabitants and the interests of
the revenue  is that of salt  In almost every country it is an
indispensable commodity  but particularly where the people subsist on
a vegetable diet  as in India and the Eastern Islands  and wherever
government has seen it necessary  it has been converted into a source
of taxation

Nearly the whole of the north east coast of Java and  MÃ¡ dÃºra  abounds
with places well calculated for its manufacture  and unfit for any
other useful purpose  The quantity already manufactured has for many
years exceeded the demand  both for home consumption and exportation
and might be increased almost  ad libitum

On Java the principal salt pans are situated at  PÃ¡kis   in the
vicinity of Batavia  at  Bantam    ChÃ©ribon    TÃ©gal   at  WÃ©dong  and
BrÃ¡hang   in the  SemÃ¡rang  districts  at  ParadÃ©si   in  RembÃ¡ng
at  SedÃ¡yu    GrÃ©sik   and  SimÃ¡mi   on  MadÃºra   at  SÃ¡mpang
PamÃ¡kasan   and  SÃºmenap   Salt is also manufactured at several places
along the south coast  but of inferior quality  and by a different
process  About two hundred tons are annually procured in the interior
from the  BlÃ©degs   as already described  The principal supply
however  is from the north coast  where the quality of the salt  and
the facility with which it can be manufactured  give it a decided
advantage in demand and cheapness

The process of manufacturing the salt on the north coast is very
simple  and depending on evaporation by the heat of the sun alone
may be favourably contrasted with the comparatively expensive process
adopted in the Bengal provinces  Reservoirs are filled from the sea
at high tide  and in them the water is allowed to remain for several
days  this being found necessary to prevent the salt from being bitter
It is then conveyed by means of canals and sluices to the pans  which
are distributed in compartments and banked in  so as to contain the
sea water  much in the same manner as the rice fields  If the weather
be dry and the sun clear  five days are found sufficient for the
process of evaporation in the pans  after which the salt is collected
together in heaps  where it usually remains five days longer before it
is brought into store

Under the Dutch government  the manufacture of salt was fanned out
to Chinese as an exclusive privilege  and to these farms  under the
plea of enabling the farmer to command a sufficient number of hands
for conducting his undertaking  and enabling him to make his advances
to government  extensive tracts of rice land were attached  over
the population of which the farmer was allowed unlimited authority
By a continued extension of these tracts  a population far more
numerous than the work at the salt pans required was wrested from the
administration of the regents and transferred to the Chinese  as they
found their advantage in renting out the rice fields  and employing the
people in the transport of goods and other laborious offices of the
country  the farms of course sold for more money  Under this system  it
is difficult to say what was the actual cost of the salt to the farmer
the manufacturers were partly remunerated in land and partly in money
and the mode varied in every district  but this remuneration seldom
amounted to more than a bare subsistence

It was the practice of these farmers general to underlet to other
Chinese the privilege of selling salt  supplying them with the article
at a certain rate  and these under farmers sold the salt again to the
petty retailers in the public markets at an advanced price  The price
of the salt  after passing through the hands of the farmers  varied
not only according to the distance from the place of manufacture  but
according to the capital and speculation of the under farmer  if he
adopted the liberal system of obtaining small profits upon a large
sale  the market was abundantly supplied at a low rate  but if  on
the contrary  he traded on a small capital  and enhanced the price by
insufficiently answering the demand  the price became proportionally
exorbitant  In some places  as at  SalÃ¡tiga  and  Ung arang   through
which the salt was transported by inland carriage to the populous
districts of the interior  the price was sometimes as high as one
hundred and twenty  and even one hundred and forty Spanish dollars per
kÃ³yan   while along the coast  as at  ChÃ©ribon  and  SurabÃ¡ya   it was
as low as thirty  and at  GrÃ©sik  twenty five  The average in the year
1813  when the farming system was abolished  may be taken  one district
with another  at about fifty seven Spanish dollars the  kÃ³gan   or
rather less than thirty dollars per ton

The quantity usually calculated for the annual consumption of Java
and  MadÃºra   including about one thousand  kÃ³yans  estimated to be
manufactured in the native provinces  is sixteen thousand  kÃ³yans
or thirty two thousand tons  Under the arrangements now adopted for
the manufacture and sale of this article  the average rate at which
the manufacturers are paid is about six rupees the  kÃ³yan   including
the charges of transport to the depÃ´ts  and the sale price varies from
twenty five to thirty five Spanish dollars  according to the distance
from the principal depÃ´ts  an adequate supply by means of smaller
depÃ´ts is insured in every part of the country

The salt of Java exported to the other islands of the Archipelago
competes with that of Siam and the Coromandel coast  and generally
supersedes it  both on account of its quality and cheapness  The
exportation is free to all places except Bengal  where  on account of
its interference with the monopoly there established  it has  since
the conquest of Java  been found necessary to prohibit its importation
under penalty of confiscation

The salt of the south coast being manufactured by a process which is
much more expensive than that employed on the north  and at the same
time being inferior in quality  it is only consumed in places which
the latter is prevented from reaching by the difficulty of conveyance
or inland tolls and prohibitions  and it has consequently been
calculated  that the north coast salt  if allowed to pass toll free
through the country  would in a short time supersede that from the
south altogether  The inferior quality of the latter is caused by the
quantity of the sulphate of magnesia it contains  which renders it by
its bitterness unpleasant for culinary purposes

Of late years  the value of the manufacturing industry of the country
may be in some degree be appreciated from the assistance it has
afforded to the European government  when  in consequence of the war
the importation of European articles had become insufficient for the
public service  Broad cloth not being procurable for the army  a kind
of coarse cotton cloth was manufactured by the Javans  with which the
whole army was clothed  At  SemÃ¡rang  were established five of these
manufactories  having seventy or eighty looms each  One or two of
them made cotton lace  and supplied the army agents with epaulets
shoulder knots  tassels   c  There were likewise manufactures of cotton
stockings  tape  fringes  cartridge boxes  sword belts  saddles
bridles   c  and in short every thing that could be required for the
dress and accoutrements of both cavalry and infantry

Under European superintendents were established saltpetre works
powder mills  foundries for shells  shot  anvils   c  and manufactories
of swords and small arms  and when it is added  that the French
government found means  within the the resources of Java alone  to
equip an army of not less than fifteen thousand effective men  besides
a numerous militia in every district  and that  with the exception
of a few European superintendants in the more scientific works  all
the articles were manufactured and supplied by the natives  it is not
necessary to adduce any further proof of the manufacturing ability of
the country

Saltpetre is obtained in many parts of the island  and gunpowder
has long been manufactured by the native inhabitants  A saltpetre
manufactory was established near  GrÃ©sik   under the superintendance
of European officers  which it was calculated would furnish annually
two thousand  pÃ­kuls  of that article to government  at the rate of
eight rix dollars per  pÃ­kul   or one hundred and thirty three pounds
English  The importance of this establishment is manifest in the
following observations of Colonel Mackenzie

I considered that one day would be usefully employed in viewing the
saltpetre works  which a very few years back had been established here
at the risk  and by the zeal and ingenuity of private individuals
with the view of supplying this colony with that necessary ingredient
for gunpowder  The best sulphur is supplied from a mountain near the
straits of  BÃ¡li   For further details of these mines  of the manner in
which the nitre is obtained  by an ingenious application of the latest
European improvements in chemistry  of the sulphureous crater of the
mountain  whence the sulphur  in its utmost purity  is supplied  of the
reports of the French engineers  last year  on the improvement of the
gunpowder of Java  of the wood selected for the best charcoal  and of
the present state of the manufactory and powder mills at  SemÃ¡rang
I must refer  at present  to several papers collected by me on this
subject  which may be usefully applicable to our manufactures of
gunpowder in India  Passing over these and other considerations  I
shall only observe  that of these mines  one of them is cut in caverns
into the soft white calcareous rock  and another  more regularly
designed  supported by pillars or masses of the native rock  covers
regularly formed beds of the native earth  which being impregnated with
the native nitre  saturated with the evacuation of the numerous bats
that haunt these caverns  and mixed with a compound of wood ashes
supplies the liquid that is boiled in large kettles  and afterwards
left to cool and crystallize  The whole process is carried on  in a
regular manner  under the direction of the first executor of this
really grand work  who now resides at  SurabÃ¡ya  52

The labour of felling the teak trees and transporting the timber from
the forests  gives employment to a very considerable population  who
are distinguished from those employed in other avocations  by the
term of  blÃ¡ndong  people  or foresters  The teak timber was formerly
delivered to the government as a contingent  by the regents of those
districts in which the principal forests were situated  the quantity
being regulated according to the supposed extent of the different
forests  and the means of cutting and transporting the wood  Previously
to the year 1808  the amount of this annual contingent was eight
thousand eight hundred beams of different sizes  according to the wants
of the public service  of which more than three thousand were delivered
from the central forests of  RembÃ¡ng

The cutting and dragging of the timber delivered in contingent was
performed by the inhabitants of the villages adjacent to the forests
and the buffaloes required were left to be provided by the regents
For this service  in the  RembÃ¡ng  districts  four hundred cutters
and labourers  and four hundred and twelve pair of buffaloes  were
appropriated for the supply of three thousand one hundred beams
annually  a proportion which varied in the other districts  only
according to the distance of the forest from the timber yard on the
coast  where payment was made for timber on delivery  at the rate
of sixteen pence for cutting and conveying a beam of from eighteen
to twenty feet long and from nine to ten inches broad  forty eight
stivers for a beam of from thirty one to thirty six feet long and from
thirteen to fifteen inches broad  and for others in proportion  This
was the regular and only payment made for the contingent timber  but
when the demands of government exceeded the fixed contingent  which was
generally the case  the excess was paid for at an advance of fifty per
cent  on these prices  Crooked and other timber for ship building was
paid for at about the same rate  but calculated according to a fixed
table by the weight

Under this system  the regents rented out many of the villages
adjoining the forests to individuals  and sold  on their own account
such timber as was not of proper quality to be delivered to government
As the demands of government increased  as well as those of the
European residents  who were many of them concerned in ship building
and in the sale of timber  the forests near the coast were soon
exhausted of their best timber  and as it became necessary for the
cutters to go further into the interior  the labour and expense
increased  but without any corresponding recompense to them  for the
government never raised the price  Individuals  however  did so  and
the consequence was  that government finding no regulations they could
make for the internal management of the forests sufficient to ensure
them an adequate supply  were contented to believe that a greater
quantity than was actually furnished could not be cut without injury to
the forests  although  at that very time  the deliveries to individuals
in the eastern districts were estimated at not less than fifty or sixty
thousand beams per annum  the coast was lined with Java built trading
vessels of every description  and these  as well as the rough timber
were frequently sent for sale to a distant market

In the year 1808  however  in common with all the other departments
on the island  this important one was newly organized by Marshal
Daendels  who placing the highest value on the forests  and determining
to prevent the abuses which had previously existed  removed all the
population which had formerly been engaged in the forests in the
different parts of the island from the controul of the native regent
as well as the local European authority  and placed them  with the
villages and lands to which they were attached  under a separate board
or administration for the forest department  This change effectually
secured government in the monopoly  and succeeded in the prevention
of the abuses which had formerly existed  but in the degree that it
had this effect  it also operated to the serious injury of general
commerce and the domestic comfort of the inhabitants  for every one was
now obliged to buy the timber from government  at a high monopoly rate
fixed by general regulation  and the timber could only be obtained in
comparatively small quantities  seldom of the dimensions required  and
only at the fixed staples  Ship building  and even boat building  which
had before been carried to the greatest extent along the whole coast
was discontinued  and the cottage of the native  which had formerly
cost a few rupees  now cost ten times the amount if built of desirable
materials

Under the administration of the Board of Forest  whose residence
was fixed at  SemÃ¡rang   and who were altogether independent of the
local authorities  was now placed a population of nearly one hundred
thousand souls  exclusively devoted to the labours of the forests
and as no revenue had been given up by the arrangement  and a small
annual delivery of iron  salt  and gunpowder  to the foresters  was
the only payment made  considerable profit was expected to result from
it to the government  It was found  however  after the establishment
of the British government  that the timber which had been cut  and of
which there was an immense quantity on hand  was not of a description
required for the building of coasting vessels  and could not compete
in Bengal with that of Pegu  without such a reduction in the monopoly
price  as added to the loss occasioned by so large a proportion of the
population  who were set apart for this duty and contributed nothing
else to the revenue  the extent of the establishment necessary to
enable the government to be the sole timber merchant  and the abuses
connected with it  would amount to more than all the profits that
had been calculated on  The coasting trade was perishing for want of
vessels  and the forest department was a losing concern  Under these
circumstances  it was judged expedient to include the population of
the  BlÃ¡ndongs  in the general arrangements for the release of the
peasantry from feudal bondage  and the establishment of a fixed rent
from the land  in lieu of all services and payment formerly rendered

The people who lived near the forests  and had long been in the habit
of cutting and dragging the timber  still however continued in this
employment  an annual contract being made with them for their services
in the forests  in remuneration for which a remission of rent was
granted  The largest and most valuable forests are  under this system
reserved for the exclusive use of government  others of less value
and the limits of which can be easily defined  have  in consideration
of a recognition of ten per cent   ad valorem  on the timber when
worked up  been thrown open to individuals engaged in ship building
who generally contract with the people of the adjoining villages  to
cut and deliver the timber at fixed prices  a mode which has also been
occasionally resorted to by government  especially for the inferior and
small kinds of timber  shingles  pipe staves   c  which are allowed to
be cut in particular forests

The industry which has been excited by opening these facilities in
procuring timber  and the impetus which it has afforded to trade  may
be estimated by this fact  that within the last few years have been
launched no less than ten to twelve square rigged vessels  of from one
hundred and fifty to four hundred tons  and that many more of larger
dimensions were about to be built  when the restoration of the colony
was announced

It need hardly be observed  that due precautions have been taken for
the preservation and renovation of the valuable forests  which so far
from being exhausted  are capable of supplying besides crooked and
compass timber for ship building  forty or fifty thousand beams in the
year without injury  European overseers are appointed  and one general
superintendent is placed over the whole

As illustrative of the importance attached to these forests by the
Dutch  and of the capabilities of the island for ship building  it may
not be uninteresting to annex an extract from Mr  Hogendorp s appeal to
the authorities in Holland on this subject  53

The  Blandong  people or foresters are generally employed in cutting
or in dragging timber during eight months out of the twelve  but they
are obliged to watch the forests the whole year through  they are
regularly relieved  and half the working men are at all times left
disposable for the rice fields  The  Blandong  people have always
been accustomed to the work  and generally have their villages near
the principal forests  It is one of the advantages of the system of
contracting with the people for land payments  that in emergencies they
are willing to lend their own buffaloes to assist those of government
in dragging heavy timber  which could not be removed otherwise without
great expence  while their children at other times watch and attend the
cattle belonging to government  In short  the resources of the village
are at the disposal of government  for a land payment considerably less
than one third of the expence of hired labourers  whom it would be
difficult to procure  and still more difficult  from the character of
the people  to retain in constant and unremitting employment

Under the system of granting remissions of rent  it has been calculated
that in the districts of  SemÃ¡rang   where the assessment is
comparatively high  on account of the vicinity to a large capital  a
remission of eight rupees and a half  or about twenty shillings  being
the average amount paid annually by each cultivator  government obtains
a man s hard labour for six months of the year  But as the inhabitants
of the same village are generally accustomed to labour in the fields
alternately  and thus to assist each other  it has been found advisable
to make the remissions of rent for the  Blandongs  to the village  as
a community   in order to avoid the delay and endless vexation which
would ensue  in adjusting the petty claims of each individual

In the maritime districts on the north east side of the island  a very
large proportion of the population is employed in the fisheries  and
so moderate are the seasons  that except perhaps for a few days at the
change of the monsoon  they are seldom interrupted by the weather

The sea fish is taken either by the net  in stakes   wÃ­di    or
with the hook and line  the most considerable quantity is of course
procured by means of the two former  generally distinguished by the
term  mÃ¡yang   whence  prÃ¡hu mÃ¡yang   fishing boat  The whole apparatus
of the hook and line is called  pÃ¡nching   the usual term for angling
among the  MalÃ¡yus   The fishing boats quit the shore at about three
or four o clock in the morning  and are driven out by the land breeze
beyond sight before daylight  At about noon they are seen returning
with the sea breeze  and generally reach the shore by two in the
afternoon  The stakes along the whole of the northern coast  wherever
the banks and projecting land admit  are very extensive  they are
often fixed in several fathom water  and constitute a very important
property  They are usually closed in the night

Nets are principally made of  rÃ¡mi   though sometimes of  gadÃ¡ng an
and even of cotton  They are steeped in an infusion  which not only
darkens their colour  but is considered essentially to contribute to
their strength  Fish that is not eaten or disposed of while fresh
is salted and dried in the sun  or smoke dried at a short distance
from a fire  and in that state forms an extensive article of internal
commerce  Besides the abundance of fish thus obtained from the sea
extensive tracts of country  salt marshes  and inlets of the sea
have in several parts of the island been converted into fish ponds
 tÃ¡mba    These ponds are to be found in most of the low maritime
districts  those at  GrÃ©sik   which are the most extensive  appear
to have been first established during the visit of one of the early
Mahomedan princes of the island in the fifteenth century  The  bÃ¡ndeng
is generally considered as the richest and highest flavoured fish known
in these seas  the young fry are taken in the sea  and transferred to
these ponds  where they grow and fatten for seven months  when they are
fit for the table  An annual supply of young fish from the sea is found
necessary to keep up the stock in the tanks  and  whether from a desire
to raise the value of the fish so obtained in them  or otherwise  the
natives generally affirm  that the fish rarely attains its full size
in the sea  The extent and value of these nurseries for the fish may
be estimated from the rent paid for those at  GrÃ©sik   which are the
property of government

The river fish are taken by a variety of methods  one is to throw a
number of branches of trees into a deep part of the river  here the
fish collect  they are then surrounded by stakes  or the branches are
taken out  and the fish easily caught  this method is termed  rÃºmpon
BÃ¡mbu  fences are sometimes thrown across the rivers at night  and
so constructed that the fish are easily entrapped as they pass down
the stream  this method is called  pÃ¡sang wÃ¡dong   The rivers and
ponds are frequently dragged by nets of different sizes  The  coculus
indicus   and other intoxicating drugs  are sometimes thrown into
the river  after which the fish are found floating on the surface
and easily taken  this method  termed  tÃºba   is prohibited on large
rivers  when the fish are afterwards driven down the river by a number
of men into a snare laid below  the usual term is  jÃ¡mprong   In the
western districts  a fishing party of this description affords a
very favourite amusement on great occasions  A time is selected when
the river is moderately low  temporary stands made of the trunks of
small trees or stout  bÃ¡mbus  are then thrown across  each consisting
of three piles  fastened together at the top and expanding below
the bottoms being pointed so as to fix in the ground  On a small
stage on each  just above the surface of the water  are piled a few
stones  by which they are steadied while the current is allowed a
free course below  The piers or stages thus formed  answer well for
the construction of a temporary bridge over the rocky or stony bed
of the most irregular river  A coarse matting  made of  bÃ¡mbu  or
some other material  is then carried from one to the other  so as to
shut the current in within a narrow space  across which a temporary
platform and shed is thrown  with a sloping floor rising above the
surface of the water  to where the party is assembled  The drug having
been thrown into the river  a considerable distance higher up several
hundred people now enter the river  and driving the half intoxicated
fish before them  they come floundering one after the other on the
bÃ¡mbu  stage  to the no small amusement of the party collected  fish
of a considerable size literally jumping into their laps  On these
occasions  when the entertainment is given to Europeans  a great
concourse of people attend  a feast is prepared  and the wild and
antic music and dance of the mountaineers  performing on the  Ã¡nklang
and rude drum  give great peculiarity and zest to the amusement  Fish
are sometimes struck at night by torch light  both at sea and in the
rivers  but this method is not very general

Pearls are obtained in the vicinity of  BÃ¡nyuwÃ¡ng i   where the
privilege of fishing for them is farmed out by the year  as well as in
the vicinity of  NÃºsakambÃ¡ng an   on the south side of the island  but
they are generally of the description called seed pearls  and of little
value

52  Journal of Colonel Mackenzie  1812

53   Batavians  be amazed  hear with wonder what I have to
communicate  Our fleets are destroyed  our trade languishes  our
navigation is going to ruin  we purchase with immense treasures  timber
and other materials for ship building from the northern powers  and
on Java we leave warlike and mercantile squadrons standing with their
roots in the ground  Yes  the forests of Java have timber enough to
build a respectable navy in a short time  besides as many merchant
ships as we require  Hemp would grow as well as in Bengal  and as
labour is as cheap in Java  we may consequently presume that it would
require little trouble to establish manufactures of canvas and cordage
there in a short time  But  at any rate  Java already produces at
a very low price cayar and gamuti cordage  which answers very well
for cables  hawsers  and rigging  To build ships at Java for the
mother country  it is only necessary to send out skilful and complete
master builders with a few ship carpenters  for common workmen are
to be had on Java in numbers  and at a very low rate  as a good Java
carpenter may be hired at five stivers a day  The principal objection
that could be made is  that the shores of Java being very flat and
level  are not well adapted for building  and still less for launching
ships of heavy burthens  but this difficulty may be easily overcome  on
the islands before Batavia  and particularly Brunt and Cooke s Island
wharfs  or even docks  may be constructed at little expence  The same
may be observed of one of the islands off JapÃ¡ra and at GrÃ©sik  besides
many other places in the eastern division  in the harbour which is
formed by the island of MadÃºra  and which is sheltered from every wind

The resident of RembÃ¡ng  and sometimes of JawÃ¡na  are almost the
only Europeans who build ships  for it is too difficult and dangerous
for others to undertake it  under the arbitrary government at present
existing in Java  under which nothing can flourish or succeed  But
the Chinese  who are favoured in every thing  are well aware how to
turn this also to their own advantage  and to build a great number of
vessels all along the coast  from fifteen to two hundred tons burthen
for which they get the timber almost for nothing  by means of renting
the forest villages  It is easy to imagine  how these avaricious
bloodsuckers use the forests  and manage to get all they can out of
them  In spite of all this  however  the forests of Java grow as
fast as they are cut  and would be inexhaustible under good care and
management

At Bombay  Surat  and Demaun  and other places along the coast of
Malabar  at Bengal  and at Pegu  the English build many large and fine
ships  which last a length of time  especially those of Bombay and
Malabar built  although I believe the wood produced there  however
good  is not equal to the teak of Java

   of the Nations and Tribes which inhabit them  Japan Trade


From the importance which the Dutch  in the days of their greatness
attached to their East India commerce  of which Batavia was the
emporium  and the importance which this commerce conferred upon them
from the desire excited in the other nations to obtain a share in
its advantages  and the crimes committed to maintain its undivided
monopoly  some idea may be formed of its magnitude and value  When
the French troops  in the summer of 1672  under Louis XIV  had
overrun the territory of Holland  with the rapidity and irresistible
force of the sea after bursting the dykes  the Republic formed the
magnanimous resolution of transporting its wealth  its enterprise  and
its subjects to another hemisphere  rather than submit to the terms
of the conqueror  and fixed upon Batavia  already the seat of its
eastern commerce  as the capital of its new empire  They could have
found shipping in their own ports for the transport of fifty thousand
families  their country was inundated with the ocean  or in possession
of the invader  their power and political importance consisted in their
fleets and colonies  and having been accustomed to maintain their naval
superiority by the fruits of their eastern trade  and to buy the corn
of Europe with the spices of the Moluccas  they would have felt less
from a removal of their seat of empire from the north of Europe to the
south of Asia  than any people who ever contemplated a similar change
while  at the same time  the very project of such an extraordinary
emigration  and the means they had of carrying it into effect  give
us the highest ideas of the independent spirit inspired by their free
government  and of their commercial prosperity  derived  in a great
degree  from their eastern establishments and connexions

The same advantages which the Europeans derived from the navigation of
the Mediterranean  the inhabitants of the Malayan Archipelago enjoyed
in a higher degree  and it cannot be doubted  that among islands
lying in smooth and unruffled seas  inviting the sail or oar of the
most timid and inexperienced mariner  an intercourse subsisted at a
very early period  To this intercourse  and to the fertility of the
soil of Java  which soon rendered it an agricultural country  must be
attributed the high degree of civilization and of advancement in the
arts  which  from the monuments of its progress which still exist
there is every reason to believe it once attained  In short  to adopt
the expressions of Dr  Adam Smith  when speaking of a very different
country 54   Java   on account of the natural fertility of its soil
of the great extent of its sea coast in proportion to the whole of
the country  and of the number of its navigable rivers  affording the
conveniency of water carriage to some of its most inland parts  is
conveniently fitted by nature to be the seat of foreign commerce  of
manufactures for sale to the neighbouring countries  and of all the
improvements which these can occasion

But though there can be little doubt that Java very early emerged from
barbarism  and rose to great commercial prosperity  to determine the
precise time at which these events took place is perhaps impossible
and to approach the solution of the question would involve an inquiry
that will be better reserved till we come to treat of its languages
institutions  and antiquities  If  in the consideration of these
topics  it should be made to appear  that  in very remote ages  these
regions were civilized from Western India  and that an extensive
Hindu empire once existed on Java  it will be reasonable to infer a
commercial intercourse still earlier than the communication of laws and
improvement

In the remarkable account of the rich commodities conveyed to ancient
Tyre  it would appear that there were many articles the peculiar
produce of the Malayan States  and in that given by Strabo of the
importations into Egypt  cloves  which we know to be the exclusive
produce of the Moluccas  are expressly mentioned  The same taste for
the fine kinds of spices  and the same desire to obtain them  which
prompted European nations successively to make themselves masters of
these islands  must in all probability have operated  in a very remote
period  on the merchants of Hindustan  and even of countries lying
farther to the westward  who had already found their way into the gold
regions  and if the hypothesis  which places Mount  Ophir  on Sumatra
or the peninsula of Malacca  cannot be maintained  it will at any rate
be admitted  that previously to the discovery of America  no country
was known more rich in gold than the Malayan Islands  and that  on that
account  they were peculiarly attractive to foreigners  who could not
be supplied from any other quarter

The Arabs  it is known  had in the ninth century  if not long
previously  made themselves acquainted with these countries  and the
Chinese  if we may trust the Javan annals  had visited Java at the same
period  According to Kempfer  the  MalÃ¡yus  in former times had by far
the greatest trade in the Indies  and frequented  with their vessels
not only all the coasts of Asia  but even ventured to the shores of
Africa  and particularly to the great island of Madagascar   for
adds this author   John de Barros in his Decades  and Flaccourt in his
History of Madagascar  assures us  that the language spoken by the
inhabitants of that large African island is full of Javan and Malayan
words  subsisting proofs of the commerce with these two nations  about
two thousand years ago the richest and most powerful of Asia  had
carried on with Madagascar  where they had settled in great numbers

Whatever credit we may attach to these statements and inferences
respecting the commerce of these islands before they were visited by
Europeans in the fifteenth century  it is certain that  at this period
an extensive trade was established at Malacca  Acheen  and Bantam  then
the great emporiums of the Eastern Archipelago  Hither the rich produce
of Sumatra  Borneo  and the Moluccas  was conveyed in the small trading
craft of the country  and exchanged for the produce of India and
China  These ports were then filled with vessels from every maritime
state of Asia  from the Red Sea to Japan  The Portuguese  who preceded
the Dutch in India  and who had fixed upon  Goa   on the coast of
Malabar  as the capital of their eastern settlements  selected Malacca
as the most convenient station for conducting and protecting their
trade with the islands  and erected it into a secondary capital  The
Dutch finding this desirable station pre occupied  and being foiled in
their attempts to dislodge their rivals  first established a commercial
settlement at Bantam  and subsequently subdued by force of arms the
neighbouring province of  JÃ¡katra    or  JokÃ¡rta    on which  as will
be afterwards mentioned  they built the fortress  the city  and the
port of Batavia

Nor was it without reason that they selected this spot for the capital
of their new empire   What the Cape of Good Hope is   says Adam Smith
between Europe and every part of the East Indies  Batavia is between
the principal countries in the East Indies  It lies upon the most
frequented road from Hindustan to China and Japan  and is nearly about
midway on that road  Almost all the ships  too  that sail between
Europe and China  touch at Batavia  and it is  over and above all this
the centre and principal mart of what is called the country trade of
the East Indies  not only of that part of it which is carried on by
Europeans  but of that which is carried on by the native Indians  and
vessels navigated by the inhabitants of China and Japan  of Tonquin  of
Malacca  of Cochin China  and the Island of Celebes  are frequently to
be seen in its port  Such advantageous situations have enabled these
two colonies to surmount all the obstacles which the oppressive genius
of an exclusive company may have occasionally opposed to their growth
they have enabled Batavia to surmount the additional disadvantage  of
perhaps the most unwholesome climate in the world

It would be as difficult to describe in detail the extent of the
commerce enjoyed by Java 55   at the period of the establishment of
the Dutch in the eastern seas  as it would be painful to point out how
far  or to show in what manner  that commerce was interfered with
checked  changed in its character  and reduced in its importance
by the influence of a withering monopoly  the rapacity of avarice
armed with power  and the short sighted tyranny of a mercantile
administration  To convey an idea of the maritime strength of the
native princes anterior to this date  as giving a criterion by which
to judge of the trade of their subjects  it may be sufficient to state
that warlike expeditions  consisting of many hundred vessels  are often
reported to have been fitted out against Borneo  Sumatra  and the
peninsula  In the art of ship building  however  they do not appear to
have advanced beyond the construction of that sort of vessel adapted to
the navigation of their own smooth seas  and now to be met with in all
their ports and harbours  nor do they seem to have had any knowledge
of maritime geography beyond the shores of their own Archipelago
and the information which they gained from the reports of the Arabs
or the traditions of their own more adventurous ancestors  This
circumstance would lead us to infer that the trade of Java was carried
on chiefly in foreign vessels  and through the enterprize of foreign
adventurers  The habits of the people had become agricultural  they
had nearly deserted an element which they had no powerful temptation
to traverse  and on which they could reap little  compared with what
they could draw from the fertility of their own territory  Leaving
therefore their ports to be filled  and their commodities to be carried
away by the  MalÃ¡yus   the  BÃºgis   the Indians  the Chinese  and
the Arabs  they for the most part contented themselves with enjoying
the advantages of a trade  in which they incurred no chance of loss
and thus  though their own country yielded neither gold nor jewels
they are said to have been plentifully supplied with these and other
valuable articles on their own shores  in exchange for the produce of
their tranquil industry and their fertile soil  This kind of traffic
was almost entirely annihilated  or at least very much diverted from
its ancient course  by the restrictive system of Dutch colonial policy
Some branches of it were  it must be allowed  partially encouraged by
the influx of European capital and the demand for particular articles
which bear a high price in the European market  but this was an
inadequate compensation for the loss of that commerce  which may be
said to be as much the growth of the country as any of its indigenous
plants  In order to show to what insignificance it was reduced under
Dutch oppression  and what tendency it has to improve under a better
system  it is only necessary to compare its state during the latter
years of the Dutch government  before the blockade  and afterwards
during the short interval of British administration  For the first
of these purposes  I have drawn  in the introduction to this work  a
short sketch of the condition of the Dutch East India Company  for a
considerable period previous to our arrival  and I now proceed to give
some account of the external and internal trade of Java  as it existed
at the time when we restored it to its former masters

The extent of this commerce  since the establishment of the British
government  and since a greater freedom of trade has been allowed
may  for a want of a better criterion  be estimated from the amount
of tonnage employed since the beginning of the year 1812  at which
period the operations of the military expedition had ceased  and the
transports were discharged

In the year 1812  the number of square rigged vessels which entered the
port of Batavia amounted to 239  and their aggregate tonnage to 48 290
tons  and in the same year the native craft amounted to 455 vessels  or
7 472 tons  or together 55 762 tons  The quantity cleared out during
the same year was 44 613 tons of shipping  and 7 762 of native craft
making together 52 375

In the year 1813  the number of square rigged vessels was 288  and the
tonnage 51 092  the native craft amounting to 796 vessels  or 13 214
tons  or together 64 306 tons

In 1814  three hundred and twenty one ships  or 63 564 tons  cleared
out with 568 native vessels  or 9 154 tons  shewing the total tonnage
of Batavia during this year to have amounted to 72 718 tons

The returns for the following year have not been received  but they are
estimated to exceed either of the two former years  and not to have
fallen much short of one hundred thousand tons  and it may be noticed
that during one year after the first accounts were received of the
successes of the allied armies against France  no less than thirty two
ships  measuring fifteen thousand tons  cleared out  and carried
cargoes  the produce of Java  to the London market

The average annual tonnage which cleared out from the port of
SurabÃ¡ya   for the three last years  amounted to about thirty thousand
tons  and the native tonnage trading to the neighbouring port of
GrÃ©sik  is estimated to have even exceeded that quantity

At the small port of  SÃºmenap   situated at the east end of  MadÃºra
which is a principal resort for the native trade  the tonnage which
cleared out was

            Small prahus and vessels     Tonnage
 For 1812         3 765                   15 230
     1813         4 752                   33 769

And the estimated value of the same

               Imports          Exports
 For  1812  Rupees  625 628  Rupees  396 820
      1813          740 080          492 020 56

The value of the imports and exports of  SemÃ¡rang   on which duties
were actually collected at that port  were

               Imports          Exports
 For  1812  Rupees  555 044  Rupees  167 101
      1813        1 530 716          985 709
      1814          686 330          549 038

The native tonnage which cleared from  RembÃ¡ng  was as follows

 In  1812    862  vessels  or  8 058  tons
     1813  1 095  ditto        8 657
     1814  1 455  ditto       12 935

The trade from the other minor ports was inconsiderable  the effect of
the regulations passed in 1813 being yet hardly felt  From  PakalÃºngan
the tonnage which cleared was for 1812  5 962 tons  and for 1813  4 679
tons  the imports being about 150 000 rupees  and the exports 300 000
rupees in each year  from  TÃ©gal  for 1812  2 445 tons  and for 1813
1 926 tons  the imports being about 50 000  and the exports about
60 000 rupees in each year

The amount of tonnage which touched at  Anyer   on the way through the
Straits of  SÃºnda   to and from Europe  Africa  and America  was

 In  1812   73  ships  29 450
     1813   73         37 546
     1814  125         56 942

By an official return made in March 1816  it appears that the total
quantity of tonnage in vessels boarded on their passage through the
Straits of  SÃºnda   amounted in 1812 to 45 000 tons  in 1813  to 56 000
tons  in 1814  to 64 000 tons  and in 1815  to 130 000 tons  to which
adding a third for vessels which passed without being boarded  the
whole amount of tonnage for these four years  would be 390 000  the
quantity in the fourth of these years being nearly triple that of the
first

The commerce of Java may be considered under the two general divisions
of the native and the European  the former including the internal and
coasting trade  with that of the Malayan Archipelago in general  the
latter comprehending that carried on by Europeans and Americans with
India  China and Japan  Africa  America  and Europe

Java has already been described as a great agricultural country  It has
long been considered as the granary of the Eastern Islands

The southern coast is for the most part inaccessible  and seldom
visited by traders  but along the north coast there are no less than
thirteen principal ports  besides numerous other intermediate and less
considerable ones  frequented by native vessels at all seasons of
the year  Many of these are sheltered  and form safe harbours in all
weather  as  Bantam    Batavia    RembÃ¡ng    GrÃ©sik   and  SurabÃ¡ya
Even where the vessels lie in an open roadstead  the wind is seldom
sufficiently strong to render the anchorage unsafe  Several of the
rivers are navigable for many miles into the interior  and most of
them are capable of receiving native vessels into the heart of the
town  through which they generally run  but the rivers of Java  as
well as those of the eastern coast of Sumatra and the western coast
of Borneo  are for the most part obstructed at their entrance by
extensive bars  which preclude the admission of vessels of any very
considerable burthen  Piers have been run out in many places  to remedy
this inconvenience  but in consequence of the quantity of soil annually
carried down  the bars or banks are continually increasing  and in some
places  as at  TÃ©gal   have nearly blocked up the communication between
the rivers and the sea

The produce and manufactures of the country are conveyed from one
district to another and to these maritime capitals  either by water
or land carriage  The principal navigable rivers to the westward  are
those which disembogue themselves below  TÃ¡ng ran    KrÃ¡wang   and
IndramÃ¡yu   and the produce brought down by them is usually conveyed
to Batavia  To the eastward  the great  SÃ³lo  river  which is navigable
from  SÃºra kÃ©rta   affords  with the  KedÃ­ri   the principal and
only outlets from the native provinces by water towards the northern
coast  Down the former  which empties itself by several mouths  near
GrÃ©sik   into the great harbour of  SurabÃ¡ya   during the rains  large
quantities of the produce of the richest provinces of the interior
are conveyed  The boats employed  which are of considerable burthen
return with cargoes of salt  This river runs through many valuable
teak forests  and consequently affords the means of easy transport for
the timber  an advantage which is also derived from several smaller
rivers on the northern coast  particularly in the neighbourhood of
the principal building yards  Facilities of the same kind are also
found at most of the sea ports  which are generally seated on rivers
passing through forests in the interior  down which timber required
for house building and the construction of small craft is floated with
ease  An inland navigation is carried on to a considerable extent
by means of small canals  in  DemÃ¡k  and some of the neighbouring
districts  where it is common  even during the harvest  at the driest
season of the year  to observe innumerable boats with their light
sails crossing an extensive  flat  and highly cultivated country and
traversing the corn fields in various directions  In the rich and
fertile delta of  SurabÃ¡ya   the whole produce of the adjacent country
is conveyed by water carriage  generally on light rafts constructed of
a few stems of the plantain tree

Goods not conveyed by water carriage  are usually carried on the
backs of oxen or horses  or on the shoulders of men and women  carts
not being generally used  except in the western districts  where
the population is thin  or in some of the more eastern districts
particularly those recently under Chinese direction  The cart of the
western districts  termed  pedÃ¡ti   is of clumsy construction  running
on two large solid wheels  from five to six feet in diameter  and
from one to two inches broad  on a revolving axle  and drawn by two
buffaloes  It is the ordinary conveyance of goods to the capital
within a range of about sixty miles from Batavia

Few countries can boast of roads  either of a better description  or
of a greater extent  than some of those in Java  A high post road
passable for carriages at all seasons of the year  runs from  Anyer
on the western side of Bantam  to within twenty miles of  BÃ¡nyuwÃ¡ngi
the eastern extremity of the Island  being a distance of not less than
eight hundred English miles  Along this road  at intervals of less
than five miles  are regular post stations and relays of carriage
horses  A portion of it towards the west  which proceeded into the
interior  and passed over some high and mountainous tracts  was found
to occasion great delay and inconvenience to passengers  and to impose
an oppressive duty upon those inhabitants  who  residing in the
neighbourhood  were obliged to lend the use of their cattle  or the
assistance of their personal labour  to aid carriages in ascending
the steeps  this part of the line has therefore been abandoned  and
a new road has recently been constructed along the low lands  from
Batavia  to  ChÃ©ribon   by which not only the former inequalities
are avoided  but a distance of fifty miles is saved  This route is
now so level  that a canal might easily be cut along its side  and
carried on nearly through all the maritime districts of the eastward
by which the convenience of inland navigation might be afforded them
for conveying the commodities continually required for the consumption
and exportation of the capital  Besides this main road from one
extreme to the other  there is also a high military road  equally well
constructed  which crosses the Island from north to south  leading
to the two native capitals of  SÃºra kÃ©rta  and  YÃºg ya kÃ©rta   and
consequently to within a few miles of the South Sea  Cross roads have
also been formed wherever the convenience or advantage of Europeans
required them  and there is no part of the Island to which the
access is less difficult  But it is not to be concluded  that these
communications contribute that assistance to agriculture or trade on
Java  which such roads would afford in Europe  their construction
has  on the contrary  in many instances  been destructive to whole
districts  and when completed by his own labour  or the sacrifice of
the lives of his neighbours  the peasant was debarred from their use
and not permitted to drive his cattle along them  while he saw the
advantages they were capable of yielding reserved for his European
masters  that they might be enabled to hold a more secure possession
of his country  They were principally formed during the blockade of
the Island  and were intended to facilitate the conveyance of stores
or the passage of troops necessary for its military defence  The
inhabitants  however  felt the exclusion the less  as good inferior
roads were often made by the side of these military roads  and
bye roads branched off through all parts of the country  so that the
internal commerce met with no impediment for the want of direct or
convenient lines of communication

Nor is it discouraged by the want of understood or established
places of exchange  Bazars or public markets  here called  pÃ©kan
are established in every part of the country  and usually held twice
a week  if not oftener  The market days are in general regulated by
what are called  pÃ¡sar  days  being a week of five days  similar to
that by which the markets in South America appear to be regulated
At these markets are assembled frequently some thousands of people
chiefly women  on whom the duty devolves of carrying the various
productions of the country to these places of traffic  In some
districts  extensive sheds are erected for the accommodation of the
people  but  in general  a temporary covering of thatch  to shelter
them from the rays of the sun  is made for the occasion  and thought
sufficient  Where the market is not held within a town of considerable
size  the assemblage usually takes place under a large tree  in a spot
occupied from immemorial usage for that purpose  In these markets there
are regular quarters appropriated for the grain merchant  the cloth
merchant  venders of iron  brass  and copper ware  and dealers in the
various small manufactures of the country  as well as those of India
China  and Europe  Prepared eatables of every kind  as well as all
the fruits and vegetables in request  occupy a considerable space in
the fair  and find a rapid sale  In the more extensive bazars  as at
SÃ³lo   the  kris  handle makers have their particular quarter  and in
an adjoining square  horses and oxen are exposed for sale

Small duties are generally levied in these bazars  the collection of
which was formerly farmed out to Chinese  but it being found that
they exacted more than the settled or authorized rate  and that they
contrived  by means of the influence which their office conferred  to
create a monopoly in their own favour  not only of the articles of
trade but of many of the necessaries of life  that system has latterly
been relinquished wherever practicable  and government has taken the
management of that portion of the public revenue into its own hands  In
the bazars  accordingly  regulated under the immediate superintendence
of its officers  extensive sheds are built  and a small compensation
only is required for the use of them by those who there intend to
expose their goods for sale  This duty is collected at the entrance
into the market place  and is taken in lieu of all other taxes or
customs whatever  formerly levied on the transit or sale of native
commodities  It is to be regretted  that this improvement had not been
extended to the native provinces  where every article of produce and
manufacture is still impeded in its progress through the country to
the place of consumption or export  by toll duties and other impolitic
exactions  and charged on its arrival there with heavy bazar duties  to
the discouragement of industry and enterprize  and the depression of
agriculture and trade  in a degree not compensated by a proportionate
benefit to the revenue 57

Almost all the inland commerce  beyond what is thus carried on though
the medium of bazars  is under the direction of the Chinese  who
possessing considerable capital  and frequently speculating on a very
extensive scale  engross the greater part of the wholesale trade  buy
up the principal articles of export from the native grower  convey them
to the maritime capitals  and in return supply the interior with salt
and with the principal articles imported from the neighbouring islands
or from foreign countries  The industry of the Javans being directed
almost exclusively to the cultivation of the soil  they are satisfied
if they can find an immediate market for their surplus produce  and the
Chinese  from their superior wealth and enterprize  offering them this
advantage without interfering with their habits  have obtained almost a
monopoly of their produce  and an uncontrolled command of their market
for foreign commodities

The trade carried on by native vessels along the coast  with the
neighbouring islands  and with the peninsula of Malacca  has been
even more shackled than that placed under the impolitic restraints of
interior regulation  and if it exists now to any considerable extent
it is owing only to the great natural advantages that attend it
Independently of the dangers to which the peaceable unprotected trader
has so long been exposed  from the numerous pirates who infest the
Eastern Seas  and who for many years have been in the habit of annually
sweeping the coast of Java  the various restrictions  penalties  and
prohibitions established by the Dutch government  in order to insure
their own monopoly  closed all the minor ports against him

Among these restrictions  none operated more forcibly to prejudice
the native trade than the rigid and enforced monopoly of the teak
timber  an article of produce with which Java abounds  and of which
the shipping of the Archipelago had  from time immemorial  been
principally constructed  The facilities for building and repairing
vessels along the coast  while the sale of timber was unrestricted
not only allowed a more abundant supply of shipping at a cheap rate
for the convenience of the native trader  but attracted the beneficial
visits and the intercourse of foreigners  and encouraged a species of
trade  which under the recent system has been lost  The  BÃºgis  and
Arabs of the different eastern ports  navigating in large vessels
were induced to give them an annual repair on Java  and rather than
depart in ballast  frequently carried out cargoes  the profits of which
alone  independently of their refit  would not have been sufficient
to tempt them to the speculation  These adventurers not only imported
considerable quantities of gold dust to defray the expence of their
repairs  but many other articles the produce of the Malayan islands
for which they in return exported large quantities of salt and other
bulky commodities  which would otherwise hardly repay their freight
In consequence of the stop put to this kind of intercourse  the
Malayan States were principally supplied with salt from Siam and the
Coromandel coast  or manufactured the article for themselves  while
an accumulating undemanded surplus for many years remained on Java
unsaleable  Of the nature of the restrictions under which the internal
commerce and the native trade in general were placed until lately  some
idea may be formed from the amount of the duties which were exacted at
ChÃ©ribon  prior to the introduction of the land revenue settlement 58

These  with still heavier and more vexatious duties and exactions
were levied on trade in other districts of the island  Constant
requisitions were made by the Dutch government for the services of
native vessels  at rates far below a just compensation to the owner
and the native traders were forbidden to traffic in any of the articles
of Dutch monopoly  considerations which incline us rather to express
our surprize  that there should have been any native trade at all  than
that there should be so little as now exists

The coasting trade is carried on in vessels belonging chiefly to
Chinese  Arabs  and  BÃºgis   natives of Celebes   and in smaller
Malayan  prÃ¡hus  59   The enterprize of the Arabs  Chinese  and
BÃºgis  is very conspicuous  They are in general fair traders  and
Europeans acquainted with their several characters can rely on their
engagements  and command their confidence  Many of them  particularly
the  BÃºgis   are possessed of very large capital

By means of the coasting trade  the produce of the maritime and inland
districts is conveyed to  Batavia    SemÃ¡rang   and  SurabÃ¡ya   the
principal ports of consumption and exportation  and in return those
districts receive iron  steel  and other articles of foreign produce
and manufacture from abroad  The western districts being but thinly
inhabited  do not yield a sufficient supply for the consumption of
Batavia  and on this account  as well as its being the principal mart
of foreign commerce  the trade of the eastern districts is attracted
to it  in a higher degree than to any of the other great towns in
their own immediate neighbourhood  but owing to the unhealthiness of
the climate  the loss occasioned by the paper money  which the native
traders of other islands could never understand  and the various
vexations and impositions to which they were subjected  these latter
invariably prefer the more eastern ports of  SemÃ¡rang  and  SurabÃ¡ya
or rather  GrÃ©sik   in the immediate vicinity of the latter  which has
always been the principal establishment and residence of the Arabs

The  BÃºgis  import into Java from the other islands  Malayan camphor
tortoise shell  edible birds  nests  bees  wax  cloth called  sÃ¡rongs
of a very strong texture  their own manufacture  and gold dust  which
they lay out in the purchase of opium  iron  steel  Europe chintzes
and broad cloth  and Indian piece goods  besides tobacco  rice  salt
and other productions and manufactures of Java  with which they return
eastward during the favourable monsoon

The Arabs navigate square rigged vessels  from fifty to five hundred
tons burden  The Chinese also have many brigs  besides their peculiar
description of vessels called junks  as well as native built  prÃ¡hus
They extend their voyages to Sumatra  the Straits of Malacca  and
eastward as far as the Moluccas and Timor  collecting birds  nests
camphor   bich de mar   and other articles  making Java a grand depÃ´t
for the produce of all the countries to which they resort  Throughout
the whole of Java  trade is usually conducted by the Chinese  many of
them are very rich  and their means are increased by their knowledge of
business  their spirit of enterprize  and their mutual confidence

If a cargo arrives too extensive for the finances of one individual
several Chinese club together  and purchase the goods  each dividing
according to his capital  In this manner a ready market is always open
at Java  without the assistance of European merchants  and strangers
are enabled to transact their business with little trouble or risk

The objections which have been made to the political influence of the
Chinese and Arabs in the Eastern Islands  do not equally apply to them
as traders  In this last capacity  and subject to regulations which
prevent them from uniting the power of a chief with the temper of a
merchant  and despotism with avarice  their value cannot be too highly
rated  The persevering industry and speculative turn of the Chinese is
too well known to need description  and the Arab traders are here what
they are all over the world  keen  intelligent  and adventurous  The
BÃºgis  have long been distinguished among the Eastern Islands for the
extent of their speculations and the fairness of their dealing

Java exports  for the consumption and use of the other islands of the
Archipelago  including the Malayan ports on the peninsula  rice  a
variety of vetches  salt  oil  tobacco  timber  Java cloths  brass
ware  and a variety of minor articles  the produce of her agriculture
and manufactures  besides occasionally  as the market admits  a
considerable quantity of European  Indian  and Chinese goods  Almost
the only articles for which Java is at present dependent on its
neighbours are  gÃºmbir   imported from Lingen   Ling ga   and Rhio
where it is produced to the annual amount of from twenty to thirty
thousand  pÃ­kuls    and  pÃ¡mur   the metal used for damasking the
Javan  krÃ­s   of which a small quantity is imported from  Biliton
and  CÃ©lebes   where alone it is found  The following articles
the exclusive produce of the Eastern Islands  are collected at its
principal ports  for re exportation to India  China  and Europe  tin
from  BÃ¡nka   gold dust  diamonds  camphor  benjamin and other drugs
edible birds  nests   bich de mar   rattans  bees  wax  tortoise shell
and dyeing woods  from Borneo and Sumatra  sandal and other fine woods
nutmegs  cloves and mace  coarse  wild and damaged spices   kÃ¡yu pÃºti
and other pungent oils  from the Moluccas  horses and sapan wood  from
SumbÃ¡wa    BÃºgis  cloths  and many collections for the Chinese market
from CÃ©lebes  Cloths are also sometimes imported from  BÃ¡li   and
pepper is collected at  BÃ¡njermÃ¡sin   on Borneo  and from several of
the Malayan states

The tin brought to Java is almost exclusively from the mines of
BÃ¡nka   This metal is also exported from several of the other islands
and from the peninsula of Malacca  whence these countries have been
considered the  Temala  of Ptolemy   timÃ¡h  being the Malayan word for
tin  but the quantity obtained from all other sources falls far short
of what is procured on  BÃ¡nka   which exports to the annual amount of
thirty thousand  pÃ­kuls   or nearly forty thousand cwt  of this metal
The mines on  BÃ¡nka  are worked by Chinese  who deliver the metal into
the government stores in slabs  at the rate of about eight Spanish
dollars the  pÃ­kul   of one hundred and thirty three pounds and a
quarter

A very extensive branch of trade is carried on by a direct
communication between Java and China  entirely upon Chinese capital
in a description of vessels called junks  From eight to ten of these
vessels arrive annually from Canton and Amoi  with cargoes of teas
raw silk  silk piece goods  varnished umbrellas  iron pots  coarse
china ware  sweetmeats  nankeen  paper  and innumerable minor articles
particularly calculated for the Chinese settlers  They are from three
to eight hundred tons burthen  and sail at stated periods  generally
reaching Batavia with the north east monsoon  about the month of
January  Of all the imports from China  that which produces the most
extensive effects on the commercial and political interests of the
country is the native himself  besides their cargoes  these junks bring
a valuable import of from two to five hundred industrious natives
in each vessel  These emigrants are usually employed as coolies or
labourers on their first arrival  but  by frugal habits and persevering
industry  they soon become possessed of a little property  which they
employ in trade  and increase by their prudence and enterprize  Many of
them  in course of time  attain sufficient wealth to render themselves
independent  and to enable them to remit considerable accumulations
yearly to their relations in China  As these remittances are generally
made in the valuable articles  such as birds  nests  Malayan camphor
bich de mar   tin  opium  pepper  timber  leather hides  indigo  gold
and silver  the return cargoes of these vessels amount to an almost
incredible value

The quantity of edible birds  nests alone  annually exported from Java
to China on vessels of this description  is estimated at not less than
two hundred  pÃ­kuls   of which by far the largest proportion is the
produce of the Javan rocks and hills  It is well known that these are
the nests of a species of swallow  hirundo esculenta  common in the
Malayan islands  and in great demand for the China table  Their value
as a luxury  in that empire  has been estimated on importation to be
weight for weight equal with silver  The price which these nests of the
best quality have of late years brought in the Canton and Amoi market
has been forty Spanish dollars per  kÃ¡ti   of rather more than a pound
and a quarter English  They are usually classed into first  second
and third sorts  differing in price from forty to fifteen Spanish
dollars  and even to ten and less for the most ordinary  The price in
the Batavian market rises as the period for the departure of the junks
approaches  but as the principal produce of Java is still a monopoly
in the hands of government  it is difficult to fix the price at which
they might be sold under other circumstances  Generally speaking
however  they sell throughout the Eastern Islands considerably lower
than they are calculated to do in China  which may be accounted for by
the perishable nature of the commodity  and the great care necessary to
preserve them from the damp  as well as from breakage  On this account
they are seldom bought by European traders  Birds  nests consigned by
the Javan government to the Canton factory in 1813  sold to the amount
of about fifty  pÃ­kuls   at an average rate of about twenty dollars per
kati   but this was at a period when the China markets were unusually
low

The quantity of birds  nests obtained from the rocks called  KÃ¡rang
bÃ³lang   on the southern coast of Java  and within the provinces
of the native princes  is estimated  one year with another  at a
hundred  pÃ­kuls   and is calculated to afford an annual revenue to
the government of two hundred thousand Spanish dollars  The quantity
gathered besides by individuals  on rocks and hills belonging to them
either in private property or held by farm from the government  in
other parts of the island  may amount to fifty  pÃ­kuls   making the
extent of this export not less than one hundred and fifty  pÃ­kuls
besides the amount of the collections from the other islands of the
Archipelago

In the Malayan islands in general  but little care is taken of the
rocks and caverns which produce this dainty  and the nests procured are
neither so numerous nor so good as they otherwise would be  On Java
where perhaps the birds are fewer  and the nests in general less fine
than those to be met with in some of the more Eastern Islands  both
the quantity and quality have been considerably improved by European
management  To effect this improvement  the caverns which the birds are
found to frequent are cleansed by smoking and the burning of sulphur
and the destruction of all the old nests  The cavern is then carefully
secured from the approach of man  the birds are left undisturbed to
form their nests  and the gathering takes place as soon as it is
calculated that the young are fledged  If they are allowed to remain
until eggs are again laid in them  they lose their pure colour and
transparency  and are no longer of what are termed the first sort  They
are sometimes collected so recently after their formation  that time
has not been given for the bird to lay or hatch her eggs in them  and
these nests are considered as the most superior  but as the practice
if carried to any extent  would prevent the number of the birds from
increasing  it is seldom resorted to  where the caverns are in the
possession of those who have a permanent interest in their produce
Much of their excellence and peculiar properties  however  depend on
the situation of the place in which they are formed  It has often been
ascertained  for instance  that the same bird forms a nest of somewhat
different quality  according as it constructs it in the deep recesses
of an unventilated and damp cavern  or attaches it to a place where the
atmosphere is dry  and the air circulates freely  The nature of the
different substances also to which they are fixed  seems to have some
influence on their properties  The best are procured in the deepest
caverns   the favourite retreat of the birds   where a nitrous dampness
continually prevails  and where being formed against the sides of the
cavern  they imbibe a nitrous taste  without which they are little
esteemed by the Chinese  The principal object of the proprietor of a
birds  nest rock is to preserve sufficient numbers of the swallows
by not gathering the nests too often  or abstracting those of the
finer kinds in too great numbers  lest the birds should quit their
habitations and emigrate to a more secure and inaccessible retreat
It is not unusual for a European  when he takes a rock under his
superintendence  after ridding it of the old nests and fumigating the
caverns  to allow the birds to remain undisturbed  two  three  or even
more years  in order that they may multiply for his future advantage
When a birds  nest rock is once brought into proper order  it will
bear two gatherings in the year  this is the case with the rocks under
the care of the officers of government at  KÃ¡rang bÃ³lang

In the vicinity of the rocks are usually found a few persons accustomed
from their infancy to descend into these caverns  in order to gather
the nests  an office of the greatest risk and danger  the best nests
being sometimes many hundred feet within the damp and slippery opening
of the rock  The gatherers are sometimes obliged to lower themselves by
ropes  as at  KÃ¡rang bÃ³lang   over immense chasms  in which the surf of
a turbulent sea dashes with the greatest violence  threatening instant
destruction in the event of a false step or an insecure hold  The
people employed by government for this purpose were formerly slaves  in
the domestic service of the minister or resident at the native court
To them the distribution of a few dollars  and the preparation of a
buffalo feast after each gathering  was thought sufficient pay  and
the sum thus expended constituted all the disbursements attending the
gathering and packing  which is conducted by the same persons  This
last operation is however carefully superintended by the resident  as
the slightest neglect would essentially deteriorate the value of the
commodity 60

Although the Malayan camphor  which is the exclusive produce of Sumatra
and Borneo  is much stronger than the camphor from China  it has not
yet been considered an article of extensive export for the European
market  It is always  however  in the greatest demand in China  where
it is either consumed  or as has been supposed by some  it undergoes
a certain process previous to its re exportation under a different
appearance  It is not known in what manner the China camphor for the
European market is prepared  and unless the Malayan camphor is used
in the composition  it seems difficult to account for the constant
demand for it in China  whence it is never re exported in its original
state  Whatever value may be set on the Chinese camphor  that exported
from Japan is of a still superior quality  and more in demand for the
European market

Bich de mar  is well known to be a dried sea slug used in the dishes
of the Chinese  it is known among the Malayan Islands by the name of
trÃ­pang   and collected on the shores of nearly all the islands of the
Archipelago  It usually sells in China at from ten to fifty dollars
per  pÃ­kul   according to its quality  but being an article still
more perishable than the birds  nests  and very bulky and offensive
it seldom composes the cargoes of European vessels  It would be very
difficult to ascertain the average price  as it varies according to the
difficulties experienced in collecting it  and the immediate demand in
the market  for its perishable nature will not admit of the excess of
one season being laid by to meet the deficiency of another  It requires
constant care on the voyage  and a leaky vessel frequently loses a
whole cargo

Stic lac  used in dying  is procured in many parts of Java  and can
easily be obtained in a quantity sufficient to meet the demand  The
insect which yields it abounds in the Bantam districts  and the lac
prepared is considered of good quality  but it is not an article which
appears to have attracted much attention

The trade between Java and China in vessels belonging to Europeans
at present consists principally in carrying out tin  pepper  spices
rattans  and betel nut  for the China market  and receiving in return
a few articles of China produce in demand for the European market  a
balance of cash  and a supply of manufactures required annually at
Batavia  but it is calculated that cotton  rice  and timber  which may
be considered as the staple produce of Java  might be exported to China
with advantage

A small quantity of Javan cotton lately sent to China  was sold at
a higher rate than the ordinary prices of the cotton from Western
India 61   Cotton yarn is an article sometimes exported to China  but
in the existing state of society on Java  the exportation of the raw
material is likely to be attended with the greatest advantages  Some
writers have estimated the capability of Java to export raw cotton
almost incredibly high  but it must be admitted  that although the soil
is not universally favourable  yet few countries afford greater general
advantages for the cotton cultivation  it being practicable to raise it
to a great extent  without interfering with the general grain produce
of the country  It could be grown as a second crop on the rice fields
being planted shortly after the harvest  and attaining maturity before
the season again comes round for irrigating the lands  Nothing can
convey a higher idea of the richness of the soil of Java  and of the
advantages of its climate  than the fact  that during one half the year
the lands yield a rich and abundant crop of grain  more than sufficient
for the ordinary food of the population  and during the other half a
valuable staple  which affords the material for clothing them  and
opens in its manufacture a source of wealth and of continual domestic
industry through the year

Enterprising individuals  merchants of Batavia  have not been wanting
to engage in the valuable fur trade  hitherto carried on principally
by the Americans  between Kamtschatka and China  Mr  Timmerman Thyssen
an enlightened Dutch gentleman  whose name for honourable dealing
and extensive business has always stood high among the merchants of
Batavia  has entered into more than one speculation of this kind
Vessels fitted out from Batavia took in furs at Kamtschatka  which were
intended to be exchanged in China for dollars  but the dangers of the
passage in one instance  and the informality of the papers in another
rendered this bold and promising enterprize productive of but little
pecuniary advantage  Nothing  however  has occurred  to prove that the
adventure would not have fully answered its intention in time of peace
the principal difficulties which attended and frustrated it ceasing
with the war

Since the conquest a very extensive trade has been carried on by the
English country ships importing from Calcutta  Madras  and Bombay
all kinds of piece goods  opium  and other articles  the returns for
which have been usually made by bills  gold dust  bees  wax  tin  Japan
camphor  sago  and teak timber

The piece goods of Western India have always formed an extensive
article of import into Java  and the annual value of those latterly
imported cannot well be estimated at less than a million of dollars
Those generally meet a ready sale  at an advance of from thirty to
forty per cent  upon the prime cost in India  and much more when the
supply is scanty

In consequence of these heavy and valuable importations  the returns to
Bengal were till lately made principally by bills  obtainable either
from government  or individuals desirous of purchasing colonial produce
for the European market by means of funds in Western India  But there
are also several articles  which experience has proved well calculated
for making their returns direct to Bengal  particularly Japan copper
and teak timber  Java is known to abound with valuable teak forests
and the quality of the wood has been considered as superior to that of
Pegu or the Malabar coast  The restrictions under which this export
was formerly placed as a government monopoly  prevented its finding
its way beyond the immediate Dutch dependencies  but the extent to
which it was even then sent to the Moluccas  to Malacca  and to the
Cape of Good Hope  where all the public buildings are constructed of
Javan teak  sufficiently attests the value and extent of the forests
as well as the good quality and durability of the wood  This valuable
but bulky article of export  is always in demand for ship building
in Bengal  and has afforded to the merchant a very liberal profit on
exportation  after paying the present government prices  which are
calculated at something above ten per cent  upon the actual expence
of cutting and dragging the timber from the forests to the port of
exportation  During the last two years  large ships have taken cargoes
to Bengal  and afforded very handsome profits  From the neighbourhood
of  RÃ©mbÃ¡ng   where permission has been given to individuals to cut the
timber  on paying a duty of ten per cent  on the estimated value when
worked up  it has not only been exported at a cheap rate to Bengal  but
several ships have been constructed of it  while along the whole line
of coast  from  SemÃ¡rang  to  GrÃ©sik   small vessels and country craft
are launched every month

But although the direct trade with Bengal has thus been always against
Java  the demand for sugar in the Bombay market always affords the
means of a circuitous return of capital  Large quantities of Javan
sugar have been exported to Bombay during the last four years
principally on the returning ships in ballast touching at Batavia on
their way from China  and these cargoes have afforded considerable
profit  A lucrative trade in this article is also sometimes carried
on by the Arabs to the Red Sea  and particularly to Mocha  but Arab
traders  of sufficient capital for these extensive speculations  have
by the effects of the former monopoly on Java  long been driven out of
the market  and sufficient time has not been given for them to return

The extensive produce of this fine island in sugar and coffee of
superior quality  and the pepper and various other articles  either
yielded by it or collected from the neighbouring countries  such as
sago  tin  Japan copper  spices  elephants  teeth  sticklac  long
pepper  cubebs  tortoise shell  gold  diamonds  Japan wood  ebony
rattans  indigo   c  present fine subjects for commercial speculation
to all parts of Europe and America  the Cape of Good Hope  and the
Mauritius  and the more so  as from the extensive native and European
population  a very considerable and constant demand exists for the
produce and manufactures of Europe  not only for the consumption and
use of the island itself  but to supply the neighbouring Malayan states
by way of barter

The quantity of sugar seems to depend almost entirely upon the demand
and is likely at all times to equal it  few countries affording equal
advantages for its manufacture  Owing to the want of a demand for this
kind of produce  for several years antecedent to the conquest  many
of the manufactories were discontinued  but since the trade has been
opened  and the demand renewed  many of them have again commenced
working  and the quantity produced in the year 1815 was not less than
twenty thousand  pÃ­kuls

The manufacturers being no longer compelled to deliver their produce
to government  can afford to sell the sugar at Batavia at from four to
six Spanish dollars  or from twenty to thirty shillings  per  pÃ­kul
the quality being distinguished into first  second  and third sorts
of which the first may be bought in the market for exportation at
six Spanish dollars per  pÃ­kul   or about twenty five shillings the
hundred weight  The quality of this sugar is altogether different from
the sugar in Bengal  and is said to be equal to that of Jamaica  being
manufactured in a great measure according to the same process  While
the European market is open for coffee and other light articles  the
sugar of Java is always in demand for dead weight  and large quantities
have recently been sold in the London market as high as ninety and one
hundred shillings per hundred weight 62

The quantity of coffee delivered to government in the year 1815
exceeded seventy thousand  pÃ­kuls   about thirty thousand  pÃ­kuls  more
may have been exported by individuals  and the produce is greatly on
the increase 63

The Batavian arrack is well known in the European market  and was at
one time imported in considerable quantities into the continent of
Europe  It is distilled in a great measure from molasses  in which
respect  as well as in the process employed  it differs so materially
from the arrack of continental India  that it cannot with propriety
be considered as the same spirit  it is in fact vastly superior to
it  and capable of competing in the European market with the rum of
the West Indies  Its price at Batavia  where any quantity can at all
times be procured  is for the first sort about sixty Spanish dollars
for the second sort fifty  and for the third thirty Spanish dollars
the leaguer  the first sort  which is above proof  thus selling by
the leaguer of one hundred and sixty gallons  at the rate of about
twenty pence the gallon  In consequence of the prohibitory duties
against the importation of this article into Great Britain or British
India  this branch of commerce has latterly declined  and many of the
distilleries have been discontinued

The Dutch possessions of Ceylon  the Cape of Good Hope  and the
Moluccas  dependent on the government of Batavia  always received their
principal supplies of rice from Java  and considerable quantities have
of late been occasionally exported to those places  as well as the
Coromandel coast  with great advantage  During a scarcity of grain in
England  the Java rice has also found its way to that market 64

From Europe the most important imports  and those in constant demand
for the native population  are iron  steel  copper  printed cottons
of a peculiar pattern  and woollens  Of iron  not less than from one
thousand to fifteen hundred tons are annually imported  which is worked
up into the implements of husbandry  and into the various instruments
engines  and utensils  required in the towns and agricultural
districts  The price has varied  during the last four years  from six
to twelve Spanish dollars  the average has been about eight dollars
per hundred weight for the English  and about nine per hundred weight
for the Swedish iron  The small bar iron is always in demand in the
market  in consequence of its convenience for working up into the
different implements required  Steel is also in demand  to the extent
of two or three hundred tons annually

English printed cottons  of peculiar patterns adapted to the taste of
the natives and Chinese  and white cotton sheeting cloth  always meet a
ready and extensive sale  but the great objection to the former is the
want of permanency in the colours  a disadvantage which all the English
printed cottons labour under  A very extensive and valuable assortment
of these cottons  imitated after the Javan and Malayan patterns  was
recently imported into Java by the East India Company  and on the first
sale produced very good prices  but before a second trial could be
made  the natives had discovered that the colours would not stand  and
the remainder were no longer in any demand  Would it not tend greatly
to the improvement of the British manufacture  and consequently greatly
extend the export  if the enquiries of scientific men in India were
directed  in a particular manner  to an observation of the different
dye stuffs used in Asia  and to the manner followed by the natives in
different parts  for fixing the colours and rendering them permanent

Broad cloths  velvets  glass ware  wines  and in short all articles of
consumption and use among Europeans  may on Java be considered also
in a great measure  in demand by the native population  who free from
those prejudices which preclude an expectation of the introduction of
European manufacture into Western India  generally indulge in them
according to their means  The climate of many parts of the Island
renders the broad cloth  particularly at some seasons of the year  an
article of great comfort  and among the higher orders it is usually
as with Europeans  worn as a jacket  sometimes this is of velvet  A
constant demand  limited only by the means of the purchaser  is also
daily increasing for gold lace and the other European manufactures
used in dress  furniture  saddlery   c   it may therefore be easily
conceived  to what an extent the demand for these articles is likely to
be carried  among a native population of more than four millions and a
half of souls  advancing in wealth and intelligence

It is unnecessary to notice the extent of the articles required from
Europe by the European population  as they are the same in all parts
of India  The demand is  of course  partially affected by the extent
of the military force  and by the wants of the officers  but where
there is a permanent resident European population  of not less than a
thousand souls  generally in good circumstances  it may be inferred
that the demand is always great

A continual traffic is carried on between Batavia  the Isle of
France  and the Cape of Good Hope  by which the latter in particular
is supplied with timber  rice  oil  and a variety of articles of
consumption  the voyage being frequently effected in five weeks
While the Bourbon coffee bore a higher price in the European market
considerable quantities of coffee were sent from Java to that island
and from thence re exported as Bourbon coffee

The American trade was carried to the greatest extent during the
existence of the anti commercial system of the late French ruler  when
American traders purchased the Java coffee at the rate of eighteen
Spanish dollars the  pÃ­kul  at Batavia  and by a circuitous route
imported it into France  at an advance of one hundred per cent  During
this period  the purchases of the Americans in the market of Batavia
amounted in some years to nearly a million sterling  for which they
obtained principally sugar  coffee  and spices

Having thus given some account of the internal and external trade
of Java as it at present exists  of the advantages for an extensive
commerce which it enjoys  of the articles which it can supply for the
consumption of other countries  and those which it receives in return
for its own consumption  and of the places with which its dealings are
or might be most profitably conducted on both sides  I might now be
expected to enter into the history of that trade since the subjection
of the Island to the Dutch  the regulations enacted and enforced by
them  for restraining or directing it  and the fluctuations it has
undergone during two centuries of a rigid monopoly  but this inquiry
would lead me to swell this part of the work to a disproportionate
size  I shall now merely present my readers with a few extracts
from the orders made in 1767  and strictly enforced throughout the
Archipelago  for regulating the trade and navigation of the dominions
subject to Batavia  and with a brief abstract of the amount of exports
and imports during some of the subsequent years

All persons whatever   says the first article of those orders   are
prohibited  under  pain of death   from trading in the four fine kinds
of spices  unless such spices shall be first bought of the Company
Opium was placed under the same restrictions  and enforced by the
same penalty  The exportation of pepper  tin  and Japan copper was
prohibited  unless bought for the Company  and the importation of them
not permitted  except for sale to the Company  under the penalty of
confiscation  and a fine of four times the value of the article  The
import and export of Surat silks and of India cloths  were strictly
prohibited under the same penalty  White cotton yarn and all other
sorts of it   SemÃ¡rang  arrack  and unstamped gold  were prohibited
from being exported under the penalty of confiscation  No port was
open to any vessel coming from the northward or from the Moluccas
except Batavia  No  prÃ¡hu  or vessel was to carry any greater quantity
of gunpowder and shot  than might be permitted  and regularly entered
in the pass given to the party  under penalty of confiscation of the
vessel   and the infliction of a corporal punishment similar to that
inflicted for theft   All persons belonging to the coast of Java were
strictly prohibited from sailing from any part of the coast where there
was not a Company s Resident  No navigation was allowed to be carried
on by the vessels of  BÃ¡nka  and  BÃ­liton   except to  PalÃ©mbang
All navigation from Celebes and  SumbÃ¡wa  was prohibited  under pain
of confiscation of the vessel and cargo  No vessel from the latter
place could pass Malacca  and the Company s pass to proceed to  Siak
was given only once in a year to three vessels from Batavia  two
from the coast of Java  and one from ChÃ©ribon  The China junks were
only permitted to trade at Batavia and  BÃ¡njer mÃ¡sin   No trade or
navigation whatever was permitted beyond the west point of Bantam
without a pass from Batavia  Such are the most important of thirty one
articles of restriction  serving to shackle every movement of commerce
and to extinguish every spirit of enterprize  for the narrow selfish
purposes of what may be called the fanaticism of gain  After perusing
them  the reader will rather be inclined to think the following amount
of the trade too highly stated  than be surprised that it is so low

The precious metals have always been a great article of import into
Java  as well as into the other regions of the East  In 1770 there was
imported into Java from Holland  cash and bullion to the amount of
2 862 176 Java rupees 65   and the sums imported from other quarters in
the same year  and raised by bills of exchange on Holland  amounted to
1 419 565 rupees  making in all 4 281 742  or more than half a million
sterling  The amount imported in that year was almost as great as that
in any subsequent year till 1803  when the importation of precious
metals was estimated at 7 617 122 rupees  or nearly a million sterling
This period corresponds with that of the greatest exportation of sugar
by the Americans  who  no doubt  imported the precious metals in
exchange for their cargoes  as the quantity brought from Holland in the
same year amounted only to 448 370 rupees  In the following year  1804
the quantity imported was 6 499 001 rupees  of which none at all came
from the mother country  In forty years  from 1770 to 1810  the total
of the imported precious metals amounted to 118 607 472 Java rupees
or nearly three millions annually upon an average  A great portion of
this was re exported to India  China  and the Dutch possessions in
the Archipelago  to pay for the articles brought to Batavia for the
supply of the European demand  The quantity of goods imported from
all quarters of the globe  exclusive of cash and bullion  amounted
in the year 1770 to the value in Spanish dollars of 2 350 316  and
the exports to 3 318 161  leaving a balance in favour of the exports
of 867 845 Spanish dollars  A great part of the exports was destined
for Holland  and a great part of the imports came from Holland  The
imports from Holland were again re exported to China  Japan  the
Spice Islands   c  from which  and from Bengal  Ceylon  the coasts of
Coromandel and of Malabar  and the Cape of Good Hope and other eastern
countries  the other shipments came  and to which the other exports
proceeded  The profits on the sale of that portion of the imports of
1770  disposed of in the market of Batavia for the consumption of Java
are stated at 7 895 Spanish dollars  so that  so far as the import
trade was concerned  Batavia only became the  entrepÃ´t  between the
mother country and her other possessions or stations of commercial
resort in the Indian seas  The exports of Java almost every year
exceeded the imports  as will appear from official returns which follow

There was  of course  a lamentable falling off in the foreign trade
of Java after the commencement of the war of the French revolution
some of the best markets were almost entirely closed to it  and the
intercourse with the mother country was nearly destroyed  The total of
exports to Holland and her eastern possessions  from the year 1796 till
1806  amounted in value to only 7 097 963 Spanish dollars  the imports
to 3 073 894 Spanish dollars  leaving a surplus of exports of 4 024 069
Spanish dollars  The Americans began to frequent the market of Batavia
in 1798  and through them principally was the trade carried on till the
conquest of the Island by the British  except during the short interval
of the peace of Amiens  No specie  with which Holland chiefly paid for
her eastern commodities  was imported from the mother country from
1795 downwards  except during 1802 3 and 1803 4  during which there
was only the very inconsiderable sum of about half a million of rupees
imported

It is impossible to convey a just idea of the native or foreign trade
of Java  without adverting to the commercial and political state of the
other islands of the Archipelago  Of these it may be stated generally
that the interior is possessed by the natives  collected under
leaders who have taken advantage of the great extent of the country
in proportion to its population  to render themselves independent of
the lawful sovereign  that the coast is occupied  in many places
either by pirates  by some of the ruder tribes whom it is dangerous
to invade  or by adventurous traders  chiefly  MalÃ¡yus  and  BÃºgis
These traders arrive in well armed vessels  which some of them remain
to protect  others travel up the country  not unfrequently to the
distance of a hundred miles  and at the change of the monsoon return
to their companions  charged either with plunder  or with the fruits
of a commerce carried on with the natives at an exorbitant profit
The pirates  as they drive the peaceable and honest trader from the
coast  recruit their numbers from among the seafaring men to whom he
used to give employment  The decay of commerce is accelerated  and the
natives retreat into the interior  where  for want of a market  they
cease to collect the rich productions of their country  and rapidly
sink into poverty and barbarism  The sea and the coast remain a scene
of violence  rapine  and cruelty  The mouths of the rivers are held by
lawless banditti  who interrupt the trade of those who inhabit their
banks  and capture the vessels destined for the inland towns  the bays
and harbours are entirely within their power  and in these smooth seas
they are never driven a moment from their stations  or diverted by
danger from their predatory vigilance  The sovereigns of the country
have too little authority over their nominal subjects  and their
resources are too confined for them to oppose any effectual resistance
to these outrages  All restraints are withdrawn by the divisions and
weakness of the native governments  and men  rendered desperate by the
experience of lawless violence  are induced to join in the system of
plunder against which they can find no protection

This extensive  rich  and beautiful cluster of islands is thus
deprived of all the advantages which it might derive from the sea
with which it is surrounded  its harbours become the retreats of
marauders  instead of the resort of peaceful commerce  its seafaring
people are reduced to a state of nature  Where force decides right
no sovereign is possessed of paramount authority to sweep this pest
from his shores  no vessel is safe  no flag is respected  The trade is
thus confined to desperate adventurers only  to whom the existence of
piracy is more advantageous than the unmolested security of navigation
as the danger which it creates drives away all competitors of a less
daring character  and gives them a monopoly of these ports  It is too
true  also  that European traders have materially contributed to the
strength of the pirates  by the supply of arms and ammunition  At the
port of  Sambas   European vessels had not dared to touch openly for
twenty years  but such means of resistance as the pirates were found to
possess in two recent attacks upon it  could never have been collected
without large supplies from British traders

The small colonial craft  so necessary for the prosperity of these
regions  cannot without great risk venture beyond the coast  while
armed Malayan and Bugis  prÃ¡hus   and a few European speculators
engross most of the trade

The above observations apply more particularly to the coasts of Borneo
and the adjacent islands  but they are  in a great measure  applicable
to many parts of Sumatra  The unfortunate king of Acheen  who has
long been intimately connected with the British establishments  is a
young man of estimable qualities  with a title ancient and undisputed
though perhaps a weak prince  All his chiefs acknowledge his authority
though none submit to his control  Native traders from the coast of
Coromandel  and Europeans from Pinang  frequent every river  and the
profit derived from their dealings furnishes the inhabitants with
inducements and means to throw off their allegiance  The king  too
feeble to reduce the revolters  is only able to keep up a state of
continual alarm and warfare  to which the mutual jealousies among the
petty usurpers themselves mainly contribute  The trade of his dominions
is in a great measure carried on like smuggling  by armed boats
running out at a favourable moment  hiding themselves from danger  or
fighting their way through opposition  as occasion may require  and
laying their account with making up for frequent losses by exorbitant
profits  In some places  these almost independent bands are commanded
by Malabar  chuliahs   and  in most instances  the petty chiefs whom
they elevate to authority are foreign vagrants  Those places which
from their vicinity to the residence of the king  are least able to
resist his power  are supported in their opposition by the interests of
the English traders  and it is not to be forgotten  that when he made
a partial attempt to regain his authority over all the neighbouring
country  they petitioned the European authority to prevent  by its
interference  his levying a duty upon his own subjects  The petition
was attended to  and the king was compelled  by the command of
strangers  to forego the only means by which he could have preserved
his dominions from anarchy and confusion  At the period  therefore
when the resources of his kingdom would have been unfolding themselves
by the improving industry of a well regulated population  it is falling
into decay  through the personal imbecility and political weakness of
the monarch  and  breaking into detached fragments  is about to form
as many separate principalities  as formerly there were independent
governments throughout all the Archipelago 66

That there has been  at some time  a more extensive commerce on the
shores of the Archipelago is highly probable  and that there might be
cannot be doubted  The great resources  vegetable and mineral  with
which they abound  such as spices  camphor  gold  and diamonds  and the
facilities which they enjoy for navigation  offer means and inducements
of the highest nature  The general character of the people  also  as
far as it can be ascertained  appears equally favourable to commercial
intercourse  They are represented as mild  inoffensive  not indisposed
to industry  free from any obstinate prejudices of superstition  and
altogether of a different temper from that of the few who remain in a
constant state of warfare on the coast

Another favourable circumstance is the existence of sovereigns  whose
rights  however infringed  are in principle acknowledged  and who
have never been known to favour  what must be considered the chief
misfortune of these countries  and the source of almost all the rest
the horrible system of piracy  The evil is manifest  and the remedy is
not of difficult discovery  Were legitimate and acknowledged sovereigns
assisted in resuming their due authority  piracy and rebellion
might be destroyed  these shores would be peopled with their native
inhabitants  whose industry  awakened and invited by the opening of
a safe navigation to the capitals  would in fleets of small vessels
so essential to the prosperity of the Eastern settlements  bring the
produce of the interior down the innumerable rivers  and communicate
to countries  beyond the reach of foreign adventurers the comforts of
civilised life

A few years of repose to these islands  and of safe uninterrupted
commerce  with its attendant blessings  would repay with gain
incalculable  what they now claim from the benevolence and
philanthropy  if not from the justice of Europeans  who have so
essentially contributed to their degradation  If left neglected
without capital  without a safe navigation  almost without laws  the
government disunited  the people groaning under vassalage and slavery
these races must descend still further in the scale of degradation
until scarcely a vestige will remain to vindicate the records of their
history  and their political existence will only be testified by acts
of piracy perpetrated on defenceless vessels  which from accident or
ignorance may visit their inhospitable shores

In all their Eastern settlements  the favourite policy of the Dutch
seems to have been to depress the native inhabitants  and give every
encouragement to the Chinese  who  generally speaking  are only
itinerants and not children of the soil  and who follow the almost
universal practice of remitting the fruits of their industry to China
instead of spending them where they were acquired  The Chinese  in all
ages equally supple  venal  and crafty  failed not  at a very early
period  to recommend themselves to the speculating Hollanders  They
have  almost from the first  been their agents  and in the island of
Java  in particular  they acquired from them the entire monopoly of the
revenue farms and government contracts  Many of the most respectable
Dutch families were intimately connected with the Chinese in their
contracts and speculations  and whole provinces had been sold in
perpetuity to some of them  the extensive population of which were thus
assigned over to their unfeeling oppression  for the purpose of raising
temporary supplies of money

On Java  the Chinese have been generally left to their own laws and the
regulations of their own chiefs  and being  for the most part  merely
temporary residents in the country  they devote themselves to the
accumulation of wealth  without being very scrupulous about the means
of obtaining it  when  therefore  they acquire grants of land  they
generally contrive to reduce the peasants speedily to the condition of
slaves  The improvement of the people  which was never much attended
to by the Dutch  was still less so by the Chinese  and the oppression
which they exercised in the vicinity of Batavia had opened the eyes of
the Dutch themselves  A report of the Council of Batavia  a short time
prior to the landing of the English  accordingly states  that  although
the Chinese  as being the most industrious settlers  should be the most
useful  they on the contrary have become a very dangerous people  and
are to be considered as a pest to the country  for which evil   they
add   there appears to be no radical cure but their expulsion from the
interior   Wherever the Chinese formed extensive settlements in Java
the native inhabitants had no alternative but that of abandoning the
district or becoming slaves of the soil  The monopolising spirit of the
Chinese was often very pernicious to the produce of the soil  as may be
seen even at this day in the immediate vicinity of Batavia  where all
the public markets are farmed by them  and the degeneracy and poverty
of the lower orders are proverbial

The Chinese of Batavia are a very numerous body  and possess
considerable wealth  They are active and industrious  enterprising and
speculative in the highest degree in the smallest or most extensive
concerns  and equally well adapted for trade or agriculture  but  at
the same time  they are cunning  deceitful  covetous  and restless
and exceedingly unwarlike in their habits and dispositions  This is
the character given of them by Mr  Hogendorp  who  in considering the
injurious consequences of their extensive influence on Java  has drawn
a very just and able representation of it 67

In all the Malayan states  the Chinese have made the greatest efforts
to get into their hands the farming of the port duties  and this
has generally proved the ruin of the trade  In addition to these
circumstances it should be recollected  that the Chinese  from their
peculiar language and manners  form a kind of separate society in
every place where they settle  which gives them a great advantage over
every competitor in arranging monopolies of trade  The ascendancy of
the Chinese requires to be cautiously guarded against and restrained
and this  perhaps  cannot be better done  than by bringing forward
the native population  and encouraging them in useful and industrious
habits

Some of these observations regarding the Chinese are  in a high degree
applicable to the Arabs who frequent the Malayan countries  and under
the specious mask of religion prey on the simple unsuspicious natives
The Chinese must  at all events  be admitted to be industrious  but by
far the greater part of the Arabs are mere useless drones  and idle
consumers of the produce of the ground  affecting to be descended from
the Prophet and the most eminent of his followers  when in reality
they are commonly nothing better than manumitted slaves  they worm
themselves into the favour of the Malayan chiefs  and often procure the
highest offices under them  They hold like robbers the offices which
they have obtained as sycophants  and cover all with the sanctimonious
veil of religious hypocrisy

Under the pretext of instructing the  MalÃ¡yus  in the principles of the
Mahometan religion  they inculcate the most intolerant bigotry  and
render them incapable of receiving any species of useful knowledge
It is seldom that the East is visited by Arabian merchants of large
capital  but there are numerous adventurers who carry on a coasting
trade from port to port  and by asserting the religious claims of
Sheikh  generally obtain an exemption from all port duties in the
Malayan states  They are also not unfrequently concerned in piracies
and are the principal promoters of the slave trade

This may serve  in some degree  to illustrate the necessity of
establishing an equal and uniform system of port regulations throughout
the whole of the Malayan countries  for if the Chinese  on the one
hand  are permitted to farm import and export duties in different
ports  they have every facility allowed them to form combinations  in
order to secure a monopoly to Chinese traders  and on the other hand
if the Arabs  under religious pretexts  are entirely exempted from
duties  they may baffle all competition  and engross the trade of the
Malayan countries to the exclusion of European traders altogether

Let the Chinese and Arabs still trade to the eastward  Without them
the trade would be reduced to less than one third of even what it is
at present  for it is only through the stimulus which they give to
the industry of the country that its resources are to be developed
but let their trade be regulated  and above all  let them not be left
in the enjoyment of immunities and advantages  which are neither
possessed by Europeans  nor the indigenous inhabitants of the country
Since the reduction of the Dutch influence in the East  several of the
ports formerly dependant on them have almost become Arab colonies  The
evil is obviously increasing every day  and can only be checked by
encouraging the native population  and regulating on equal terms the
duties of the Malayan and other Eastern ports

In many other respects besides those which we have stated  the
commercial policy adopted by the Dutch  with regard to the Eastern
islands and the Malayan states in general  was contrary to all
principles of natural justice  and unworthy of any enlightened and
civilized nation 68

From authentic accounts it appears  that they attempted to destroy and
eradicate from a vast range of countries the most advantageous produce
of the land  in order to favour their own petty traffic  and burnt a
large proportion of the residue  in order to keep up their monopoly
price in Europe on a small proportion of this produce  Against errors
of this kind  it is to be hoped the more enlightened policy of the
present era will be an effectual preventive  but there are others
so interwoven with the interests of these islands  and so local in
their nature  that they may not so easily attract the attention of the
governing power

One feature of the Dutch policy in the Eastern Isles seems to have
been the exclusion of all foreign trade  whether European or native
excepting at certain specified ports under their own immediate control
This policy was as much connected with the general government of the
country  as with the commercial profits of the Company  for in an
Archipelago of such unparalleled extent  inhabited by tribes of such
various characters  formidable in a high degree from their very want
of civilization  it was necessary to bring forward some of the most
powerful and most favourably situated of these numerous states  and
to hold them answerable for the proceedings of the several districts
under their influence  Such views gave rise to the establishment of
certain regular and determined trading ports  and led to the vigilant
suppression of all attempts at competition and independence on the
part of the inferior states

Had this measure been combined with a liberal encouragement of the
home trade  as it may be denominated  between these privileged ports
established by the Dutch  and the various countries under their
influence  little doubt can be entertained that it would have tended
materially to promote the civilization and general improvement of all
the neighbouring nations  Very different  however  was the object
of the Dutch agreements with the different rajas of the Eastern
Archipelago  In some cases it was to secure a monopoly of all the
tin  pepper  camphor  and other saleable articles produced in their
dominions  in others it was to bind the chiefs themselves to destroy
the only saleable articles that their country could furnish  lest the
monopoly price of the Dutch should be injured by a greater quantity
of such produce being brought to market  The Dutch genius  though
exclusively devoted to commerce  has never yet been able to discover
the truth of the maxim  that in the long run it may be as gainful  to
make small profits on large sales as large profits on smaller sales
their policy  on the contrary  has not been inaptly compared to a man
putting out one of his eyes to strengthen the sight of the other

It must be admitted  that the line of conduct pursued by the English
towards the Malayan nations  had by no means been of a conciliatory or
prepossessing character  Our intercourse with them had been carried on
almost exclusively through the medium of adventurers little acquainted
with either the country or people  who have been frequently more
remarkable for boldness than principle 69   Indeed  the want of any
settled basis of traffic  and the long indifference of the British
government to the complaints of either party  had produced so many
impositions  reprisals  piracies  and murders  that any eastern trader
must have felt himself very much in the situation of a dealer in
spirits  tobacco  and blankets  among the Indians of North America  It
was the remark of Mr  Farquhar  than whom no man is more extensively
acquainted with the interests and resources of East insular India
that the indifference of the British government must have originated
solely in the want of information or incorrectness of knowledge
since it is not improbable  that the riches of Sumatra and Borneo are
equal to those either of Brazil or New Spain  and it is only from the
disadvantages under which we had hitherto entered into the competition
that these great sources of wealth had so long been engrossed by other
nations 70

The doctrine  that a colony should always be considered a distant
province of the mother country  has been foreign to the political creed
of the Dutch  and at any rate the radical want of strength in the
government of Batavia may have prevented them from venturing to act
upon it  Of course  they must always have contemplated the prosperity
of the eastern tribes with the invidious regret of a rival shopkeeper
and regarded their progress in civilization with the jealousy of a
timid despot  The fact sufficiently establishes the truth of this
remark

Independently of the effects of the European influence just described
the causes which have tended most to the depression of the Malayan
tribes  and the deterioration of their character  are the civil
commotions to which every state is liable  from the radical want
of strength in the sovereign  the constant wars between the petty
chieftains and heads of villages  the ill defined succession to
the throne  from the doctrine of primogeniture being imperfectly
recognized  the prevalence of piracy in all the Eastern Seas  the
system of domestic slavery  and all its concomitant evils  as wars for
the purpose of procuring slaves  and the want of confidence between
family and family  man and man  the want of a generally established
and recognized system of laws  civil and criminal  the want of a
similar system of commercial regulations respecting port duties
anchorage  and other charges  to prevent arbitrary exactions and
impositions in the various Malayan ports  and  finally  the monopoly of
the trade assumed by the Malayan rajas  Had Java remained permanently
annexed to the British crown  the redress of these evils would have
been  in a great measure  in the power of the English nation  the
undertaking would have been worthy of their general character  and
there was no other nation that could have possessed the means in an
equal degree  even if it had indeed possessed the inclination

The prevalence of piracy on the Malayan coasts  and the light in which
it was viewed as an honourable occupation  worthy of being followed by
young princes and nobles  is an evil of ancient date  and intimately
connected with the Malayan habits  The old Malayan romances  and the
fragments of their traditional history  constantly refer with pride to
piratical cruizes

In addition to other causes  which I shall not stop to specify  the
state of the eastern population  and the intolerant spirit of the
religion of  Islam   have eminently tended to increase the practice
The Arab Sheikhs and Sayeds  whatever doctrines they failed to
inculcate  never neglected to enforce the merit of plundering and
massacring the infidels  an abominable tenet  which has tended more
than any other doctrine of the  KÃ³ran  to the propagation of this
religion  Numerous and various are the tribes of the Eastern Isles
which have not embraced the religion of  Islam  to this day  and
consequently are reckoned infidels  cruizes against such were  and
are  constantly certain of receiving the approbation of all the Arab
teachers settled in the Malayan countries  The practice of piracy is
now an evil so extensive and formidable  that it can be put down by
the strong hand alone  though precautions against its recurrence might
be taken  by rendering  under the system of acknowledged ports  every
chieftain answerable for his own territory

Connected with this evil  though of much wider extent  is the system
of slavery in the Malayan countries  which  to apply the energetic
language of Mr  Pitt to this subject  has been none of the least
efficient causes of keeping down these regions  in a state of bondage
ignorance  and blood   In the beginning of the year 1805  the Marquis
Wellesley abolished slavery throughout India  and  on the 4th of June
1811  the Earl of Minto  by an order to emancipate all the government
slaves at Malacca  and to direct that hereafter no slaves should be
purchased or received on account of government  gave to the Malayan
nations an earnest of his sentiments on the subject  It is certainly
to the credit of our countrymen in the East  that they have ever
opposed all attempts to introduce the abominable slave traffic into
our settlements there  It was prohibited at Madras by an act of the
Governor and Council  of so early a date as 1682

The sources of slavery in the Malayan countries are chiefly piracy at
sea  captivity in war  manstealing along the coast  and the penalties
enacted in the Malayan law respecting debts and sundry misdemeanors
The surviving crews of vessels which fall into the hands of the
pirates are generally disposed of by sale at the first market  The
captives taken in the constant wars which the Malayan chieftains
carry on against each other  are generally employed in domestic
occupations  tending cattle  and cultivating the ground  where there
is no opportunity of bringing them to market  This  however  is seldom
the case  since such numbers are constantly required by the Arabs
and Chinese traders  and heretofore by the Dutch  Many of the Arab
trading vessels are almost exclusively navigated by the slaves of the
owner  and in their progress from island to island  they find little
difficulty in recruiting their crew  by receiving presents of slaves
or if that should fail  by kidnapping the unfortunate natives  This
forms a strong argument against admitting the unrestricted range of the
islands to either Chinese or Arab traders  for while this is permitted
the abolition of the system of kidnapping would be absolutely
impossible  The pagan tribes in the vicinity of the Mahometans  such as
those on  BÃ¡li   and some of the tribes of Celebes  the  HarafÃºras
the black  PapÃºas  or oriental negroes  the original inhabitants of
HÃ¡lamahÃ­ra    Coram   and other easterly nations  are in a great
measure the victims of the kidnapping system  and being infidels are
considered as fair booty

Nothing has tended more decidedly to the deterioration of the Malayan
character  than the want of a well defined and generally acknowledged
system of law and commercial regulation  The Malayan nations had
in general  made considerable progress in civilization  before
the introduction of the Mahometan religion among them  they had
accordingly  regular institutions of their own  some of which were
probably of considerable antiquity  derived from the continent of
India  and consequently radically different from those of the Arabs

Some difficulty appears to have occurred in adapting these institutions
to the general tenor of the Mahometan law  and many anomalous ones
appear accordingly to have sprung up in different states  These occur
in every part of jurisprudence  whether commercial  civil  or criminal
and are recited in the  Undang Ãºndang  and  Adat MalÃ¡yu   which are the
systems of national law among the  MalÃ¡yus   They vary considerably
from each other in different states  and still more from the generally
acknowledged principle of Mahometan law  as received by the Arabs
Hence there is  in almost every state  a constant struggle between the
adherents of the old Malayan usages and the  HÃ¡jis   together with
other religious persons  who are desirous of introducing the laws of
the Arabs  in order to increase their own importance

Among the numerous and important evils which result from this complex
and ill defined system  may be reckoned its affording an opening
for the caprice and tyranny of the rulers  and producing a general
insecurity both of person and property

The state of the Moslem religion is very different here from what it is
in the old Mahomedan states  such as Persia  Turkey  or Arabia  In many
of the Eastern Islands paganism still remains  in some districts there
are many Christians  and the Chinese swarm in every Malayan country
and live intermingled with the Mahomedans  This mixture of religion
and tribes has tended  in some degree  to soften the intolerance
of the Mahomedan system among the Malayan nations  and neither the
positive authority of  Islam   nor the persuasions of their Arab
teachers  have hitherto been able to induce them to abandon entirely
their own peculiar usages and customs  With some of these usages
especially those which relate to wrecks on the Malayan shores  and the
commercial regulations of the different ports  it becomes incumbent
on the supreme European authority to interfere  In revising these
the opportunity might perhaps be taken to procure the abandonment of
some of those maxims and usages  which have the strongest tendency to
prevent their improvement  and counteract the habits of civilized life

A circumstance highly injurious to the commerce of the Malayan
nations is the trading monopoly  which in most of the Malayan ports
is actually assumed by the chiefs  Of this monopoly there is no trace
in the  Undang Ãºndang  of the  MalÃ¡yus   or in the fragments of their
history which have yet come to light  and it is a question whether this
pernicious practice has not been copied from the monopoly regulations
of the Dutch  Where this system has been fully carried into effect
it has generally succeeded effectually in repressing industry and
commercial enterprize  and where it has been for some time established
its evils have been felt so deeply  that it may be presumed the Malayan
chiefs might be induced to relinquish it in favour of a regulated
commerce  whenever they might regain the power of collecting regular
duties in lieu of it  The Malayan laws and customs are fortunately
of a very different kind from those adopted among the great nations
of the continent in their vicinity  These nations  especially the
Siamese and Cochin Chinese  have long been accustomed to look up to
the Chinese  with whom they coincide in religion and manners  and from
whom they have adopted their exclusive maxims of foreign intercourse
The  MÃ¡layus   on the other hand  though accustomed to look up to the
Arabs as their religious instructors  seldom hesitate to admit the
superiority of both the Europeans and Chinese  both to themselves
and to the Arabs  in the arts of life and general science  and it is
certainly our interest to encourage them in this mode of thinking  and
to prevent the increase of the Arab influence among them

The Dutch nation appears to have pursued  as a principle of policy  the
propagation of Christianity among the Eastern Islands  The same object
had been previously followed by the Portuguese with great success
and there are now several small islands in the Malayan Archipelago
inhabited almost exclusively by Christians of the Catholic persuasion
In many other islands the Protestant persuasion has made considerable
progress  and teachers  in the flourishing times of the Batavian
Regency  were dispersed over all the low chain of islands which
extend from  BÃ¡li  and Lumbok   SÃ¡sak   to the great island Timor
The islands in which the Christian faith has been most extensively
diffused are the great island  EndÃ©  or  Meng  arÃ¡i   the great island
of  TÃ­mor   and the several small islands in the vicinity  and Amboina
In many of these islands the natives having no written character of
their own  have been instructed in the Roman character  and taught to
read Malayan and other dialects in it There have also been various
formularies printed for their use  and translations have been executed
for them in some of their languages  which have little or no affinity
to the Malayan  The propagation of Christianity among these islands
is obviously liable to none of those objections which have been
urged against its missionaries on continental possessions  A great
proportion of the natives are still pagans  under the influence of a
wild and almost unintelligible superstition  the principles of which
are not recorded in books  but are handed down  like stories of ghosts
fairies  and witches  with all the uncertainty of tradition  In most
instances  the people  though they stand in great awe of the priests or
enchanters  or dealers with invisible spirits  are very little attached
to the superstition in which they are educated  Many of them are said
to be very desirous of procuring instruction  and in some places they
look up with a degree of veneration to the Mahomedans  as a people who
have received something which they still want

These observations on the Malayan Islands in general  apply to no part
of the Archipelago more than to the important and great island of
Borneo

BORNEO is not only one of the most fertile countries in the world  but
one of the most productive in gold and diamonds 71   Its camphor is
the finest known  and it is thought capable of producing every kind
of spice  Its eastern coasts  which abound in sago  also furnish a
greater quantity of birds  nests  sea slug  and other commodities in
great demand in the Chinese market  than the other islands of the
East  but the interior has never been explored by Europeans  It may be
conjectured  that the ignorance of the state of the country is one of
the principal causes that no European settlement on it has hitherto
proved advantageous  but has generally been abandoned after a short
trial  The only exception to this observation is the Dutch settlement
of  BÃ¡njer mÃ¡sin   which continued from 1747 to 1810  when it was
formally abandoned by Marshal Daendals to the Sultan  by agreement
for the sum of fifty thousand Spanish dollars  The Sultan soon after
sent an embassy  inviting the English to settle  and previous to
the conquest of Java  the Earl of Minto received the ambassadors at
Malacca  and accepted their invitation

The only territory to which the Dutch had any claim on the island of
Borneo  was the coast from  SÃºkadÃ¡na  to  MempÃ¡wa   this territory they
acquired by virtue of a cession from the Sultan of Bantam in 1778
They destroyed  SÃºkadÃ¡na   and established factories at  PontiÃ¡na  and
MempÃ¡wa   which however they abandoned as unproductive after a period
of fourteen years

In no other part of the island of Borneo has there been any European
settlement  The English  in 1772  intended to have established a
factory at  PÃ¡sir   but they abandoned the design on some commotions
taking place in that state  Its object was to make  PÃ¡sir  a depÃ³t for
opium and India piece goods  and for the contraband trade in spices  In
1774  a short time after the first settling of  BalambÃ¡ngan   Mr  Jesse
was deputed as Resident to Borneo  proper   and concluded a treaty with
that state  by which he acquired for the settlement of  BalambÃ¡ngan
the exclusive trade in pepper  stipulating in return to protect
Borneo from the piratical incursions of the  SÃºlu  and  MendanÃ¡wi
men  Neither of the parties  however  fulfilled its agreement  though
the Residency at Borneo was continued for some years after the first
breaking up of the settlement of  BalambÃ¡ngan  in 1775

On the north east of Borneo  proper  lies a very considerable
territory  the sovereignty of which has been long claimed by the  SÃºlu
government  a very considerable part of this  together with the islands
off the coast  have been for upwards of forty years regularly ceded
to the English by the  SÃºlus   and has also at different periods been
assumed by them  without any objection on the part of the government
of Borneo  proper   This ceded district  extending from the river
Ki manis  on the north west  which forms the boundary of Borneo
proper   to the great bay on the north east  is undoubtedly a rich and
fertile country  though in a rude and uncultivated state  and it is
admirably situated for commerce  notwithstanding the different failures
of  BalambÃ¡ngan  may seem to indicate the contrary   BalambÃ¡ngan  is
one of the small islands off the northern extremity of the island of
Borneo  and included in the  SÃºlu  grant to the English  It would be
foreign to the present object to enter into any details concerning
the history of the settlement of  BalambÃ¡ngan   but it may be proper
to mention  that all the gentlemen who were engaged in the last
attempt were convinced that the bottom of the great  MalÃºdu Bay  would
have been infinitely preferable as a settlement on every account
BalambÃ¡ngan  is exactly analogous  in every respect  to Pinang  it
does not admit of territorial extension  and must exist  if at all  by
commerce solely   MalÃºdu   on the other hand  is a dependency on the
island of Borneo  which admits of any degree of territorial extension
may always subsist any number of inhabitants by its own produce  and
is said to communicate  by a land carriage of little more than forty
miles  with the central lakes in the vicinity of the gold countries

From every inquiry  however  and the result of some experience  and
much reflection  it may be stated  that no settlement which is founded
on a commercial  instead of a territorial basis  is likely to succeed
in that quarter  We have already acquired territorial rights  and
therefore the only question seems to be  whether these cannot be turned
to advantage  as well by cultivation as by commerce  The  DÃ¡yaks   or
original inhabitants of Borneo  are said to be not only industrious
but particularly disposed to agriculture  and so manageable  that a
handful of  MalÃ¡yus  have  in numerous places  reduced many thousands
of them to the condition of peaceful cultivators of the ground
Indeed nothing seems wanting but a government strong enough to afford
efficient protection to person and property  In the case of the
DÃ¡yaks   it must be considered as an advantage  that they have not
hitherto adopted the religion of Islam  and would consequently be more
ready from the first to regard us as their friends  It ought to be
calculated among the inducements to form a settlement on Borneo  that
in that quarter our territorial arrangement would interfere with the
claims or the rights of no European nation  To recommend  however  the
immediate establishment of a settlement at this particular spot  and
on a basis so new  would obviously be premature  as notwithstanding
the length of time we occupied  BalambÃ¡ngan   not only the interior
of Borneo was almost unknown  but until lately  even a great part of
its coasts  This supineness in the government of  BalambÃ¡ngan  is
perhaps not unexampled  The want of local information has  indeed
often proved fatal to the infant settlements of the English   Colonies
and settlements of every kind   says the author of the Letter on the
Nagrais Expedition   must at first be attended with many difficulties
which however a judicious perseverance will surmount  if there be not
some original fault in the establishment  It must be obvious to every
one  that the English never made a settlement  in which they were not
impeded by some unforeseen difficulties  so as at least frequently to
make abandoning the infant establishment appear the most prudent step
without even hoping any return for the prodigious expense which may
have been incurred by the undertaking     Various reasons   adds that
author   may be ascribed for this event  but incapacity in the person
entrusted with the management  and the want of previous examination
of the place  seem to me the most common and the most considerable
Without stopping to inquire how far the want of success in our several
attempts to settle  BalambÃ¡ngan  may have been fairly attributable
to either of these causes  it may be confidently asserted  that the
last establishment failed chiefly from its being solely of a military
nature  without either professional merchants or mercantile adventurers
being attached to it

These observations respecting  BalambÃ¡ngan  apply to it chiefly as a
territorial establishment  but there is no doubt that it would speedily
attain commercial importance  Many of the commercial advantages which
recommended its selection still exist  to an equal or greater extent
especially those which related to Cochin China  Champa  and Cambodia
But this digression has already exceeded its reasonable limits  and it
is necessary to revert to the more immediate point under consideration
the commerce of Java  Any account of this commerce would be imperfect
which after stating the extent to which it is carried  and the mode
in which it is conducted with the adjacent islands in the same
Archipelago  should omit to mention the advantages of an intercourse
with Japan  and some notices on the Japan trade

The history of the Dutch connexion with that country is well known
and can never be forgotten  Perhaps there is not such an instance in
the annals of commerce  of the disgraceful arts to which mercantile
cupidity will resort  and the degradation to which it will submit for
the attainment of its object  as in the Dutch proceedings at Japan  nor
is there  perhaps  a more remarkable example of the triumphant success
and complete disappointment of commercial enterprize  As it may be
interesting to many readers to see an authentic history of the origin
fluctuations  and decline of the Dutch Japan trade  and as even a very
succinct statement of it would swell this chapter to a disproportioned
size  I have placed a short history of it in the Appendix to this
work  to which I beg leave to refer those who have any curiosity for
such details 72   From the year 1611  when the Dutch established
commercial relations with Japan  till 1671  a period of sixty years
their speculations were unrestricted and their profits were enormous
This was the golden age of their trade  they opened a mine of wealth
and they fondly thought it inexhaustible  as well as rich and easily
wrought  In 1640  the Company obtained a return in gold  that yielded
a profit of upwards of a million of guilders  They had been accustomed
to procure  for some time previous to 1663  a return of silver to the
extent of two hundred chests of one hundred pounds each  and it was
suggested that it would be desirable for as many chests of gold of
the same weight to be sent in future  The golden and silver ages of
Japan commerce being past  the latter half of the seventeenth century
began with what the Dutch called its brazen age  that is its export
of copper  which has ever since continued the staple of the Japan
market  The trade was on the decline during the whole of the last
century  and had become of so little importance about 1740  that the
Company deliberated upon the expediency of its total abandonment  From
employing  as at one time  eight or nine ships  and exporting copper
alone to the amount of more than thirty thousand  pÃ­kuls   of one
hundred and twenty five pounds each  it diminished to the use of two
vessels  and the purchase of cargoes of five or six thousand  pÃ­kuls
The Appendix contains an account of the nature of the trade  and the
result of the Dutch adventures of 1804 5 and 1806  and of our own in
1813

FOOTNOTES

54  Great Britain

55  It is said that when the Dutch first established themselves in
Java  three hundred vessels of not less than two hundred tons each
were accustomed to sail to and from the port of JapÃ¡ra  in Java  if not
belonging to that port

56  The greatest part  or rather nearly the whole of these exports and
imports  consisted of colonial produce  of articles of subsistence
or native manufactures  mutually exchanged between the two islands of
MadÃºra and Java  Not a tenth part of the imports came from beyond Java

57   The bazars   observes Mr  Hogendorp   now produce a large  and
even an incredible amount  which however is melted away in the hands of
the native regents and also some European authorities  but the Chinese
to whom they are mostly farmed out  derive the greatest profits from
them  both by the money which they extort from the Javans  and by the
monopolies in all kinds of produce  and particularly of rice  which by
these means they are enabled to secure to themselves  The abuses on
this point are horrible  and almost induce me to recommend that the
markets should be made free and open

58  See account of ChÃ©ribon

59  Although but few of the natives of Java venture their property
in foreign speculations  the natives of Java form the crews of all
coasting vessels belonging to Chinese  Arabs  or Europeans  and it is
of them almost exclusively that the class of common sailors  known in
the east under the general denomination of Malays  is composed  Here it
may not be improper to notice the manner in which European vessels have
hitherto been supplied with such crews  and to point out the probable
causes of that atrocious conduct with which the Malayan sailor is so
generally reproached

A reference to the maritime customs of the  MalÃ¡yus  will shew the
manner in which the outfit of a native vessel in the Eastern Seas is
effected 73   Each individual on board has a share and interest in the
concern  and among themselves the maritime population is distinguished
for good faith and attachment  In the vessels either commanded or
owned by Chinese or Arabs  the same principle is attended to  and
although the common sailors in these generally receive wages  the petty
officers  who are also generally Javans  have some trifling interest
in the cargo  the common men are protected by them  and the policy
of the commanders induces every possible attention to the usages
prejudices  and comforts of the crews  They are able to assimilate more
nearly with them  and to enter more immediately into their feeling and
their wants  than it is possible for Europeans to do  and as they do
not possess the authority to obtain crews by force  it is only by a
character for good treatment that they can insure an adequate supply
of hands  These vessels navigate throughout the whole extent of the
Archipelago  to Malacca and Acheen on one side  and to the Moluccas and
New Guinea on the other  They are manned exclusively by Javans  usually
called Malays  and no instances occur of the crews rising either upon
the Arab or Chinese commander  they are  on the contrary  found to be
faithful  hardworking  and extremely docile  How is it when Malays are
employed in vessels belonging to Europeans  The Javans are originally
not a seafaring people  they have an aversion for distant voyages  and
require the strongest inducements to quit the land  even for a coasting
expedition in the smooth seas of their own Archipelago  beyond which
if they ever engage themselves on board a colonial vessel  they make
an express agreement  not to be carried  European vessels in want
of hands for more distant voyages to Europe  India  and China  have
been compelled therefore to resort to force or fraud  as the means of
obtaining crews  The Dutch government were in the habit of employing
people  known among the Javans by the term  sÃ©long   as kidnappers
who prowled about at night  pounced upon the unwary peasant who might
be passing along  and hurried him on ship board  When the direct
influence of government was not used  the native regents or chiefs
were employed to obtain people for the crews of vessels  this they
did sometimes in the same manner  though more frequently condemning
to sea as many as were required  by an indiscriminate draft on the
neighbouring population  The native chiefs were perhaps paid a certain
head money  on what may have been considered by the European commanders
as nothing more than  crimpage   The people who were seized were seldom
of a seafaring class  but almost entirely landsmen  in many instances
perhaps opium smokers  or persons obtained from the lowest and most
worthless part of the community  Once embarked  their fate was sealed
for ever  and due care was taken that they never landed again on Java
as long as their services as sailors were required

In this manner are obtained that extensive class of sailors
denominated Malays  who are found on board almost every country ship in
India  and inhabit the sea ports in considerable numbers  particularly
Calcutta  where they have a distinct quarter allotted them  They are
taken from their home against their will  and in violation of all their
views and habits  In general  neither their language or customs are
in the least understood by their new master  for though most of the
commanders in the eastern trade may speak the Malayan language  and be
accustomed to the Malayan character  they know nothing of the Javan
language  and but little of the manners  habits  and prejudices of the
Javan people

That numerous instances have occurred  in which they have appeared the
foremost in mutiny and in the massacre of their officers  will not be
denied  but it is well known  that many instances of ships being cut
off by the Malay crews  have been occasioned by the tyrannical and
inhuman character of the commanders  and however dreadful the massacre
some excuse may be made on the score of provocation  for a people low
in the scale of moral restraint and intellectual improvement  In some
cases they have been made the instruments and dupes of the villany of
others  and have merely followed in the track of cruelty  In general
so little care seems to be devoted to the comforts of these people
and so much violence offered to their habits  that a person accustomed
to observe the course of human action  and to calculate the force of
excited passions  is almost surprized to find the instances of mutiny
and retaliation are so few

60  From a course of experiments recently undertaken  and a careful
examination of the bird  by Sir Everard Home  Bart   there is every
reason to believe that the nature of the substance of which the edible
birds  nests are composed will be satisfactorily explained

61  Mr  Hogendorp makes the following observations on the cotton of
Java   This article of produce  which now  in order to provide the
Company with a few hundred  pÃ­kuls  of cotton yarn at a low rate  is
only productive of vexation and oppression to the poor natives  might
be made of the greatest value  both to Java itself and to the mother
country  The plant grows in abundance and of good quality  especially
if the best kinds of seeds are procured from the Coromandel Coast and
the Isle of France  The cultivation of cotton is not at all injurious
to any other branch  for after the rice harvest is the best season for
planting the cotton  and before the rains  when the fields are again
ploughed for rice  the cotton is ripe and gathered

Little of it is comparatively planted at present  indeed only the
necessary quantity  after providing the natives with coarse cloths  for
the government contingent  In rough cotton there is no trade at all
but  in fact  what trade is there on Java  except the monopoly trade of
the Chinese

Let us but suppose the cultivator to have a property in the soil  and
that he  as well as the trader  were at liberty to buy and sell  how
soon should we see the Javan planting cotton directly after his rice
was reaped  After being cleaned by machinery and screwed into bales  it
might be exported to China and Europe

There is no doubt that the Javan cotton would be as good at least
if not better  than the cotton of the English  whether from Bombay
Madras  and Bengal  and it might certainly be produced cheaper  but
even suppose that  when cleaned and picked  it cost ten rix dollars a
pÃ­kul   the Javans would still be well paid

62  By an official statement of the quantity of sugar manufactured at
Batavia and the various residencies of the island of Java  from the
year 1779 to the year 1808  it appears that

 In the year  1779  it was  30 131   pÃ­kuls
 In the year  1800         106 513
 In the year  1801         107 498
 In the year  1808          94 903

that during the first fourteen of these years  the quantity made and
delivered over to the Company for export to Holland  Persia   c
amounted to 642 234  pÃ­kuls   or to an average of 47 874 annually
two of these years being almost entirely unproductive  on account
of the non payment to the manufacturers of money  to enable them to
carry on their business  During the latter half of the period  or from
1794 to 1808  the quantity manufactured and delivered over to the
Company amounted to 917 598  pÃ­kuls   averaging 65 542 annually  All
the sugar for export  during this period  as stated in the text  was
delivered over at fixed rates to the government  and was placed under
laws of the strictest monopoly  To shew the great practicability of
an increase to almost any extent  we may adduce the sudden start in
the supply occasioned by the American demand in 1800  In no preceding
year had this article of produce been delivered over to the Company to
a greater amount than 67 552  pÃ­kuls   and in that year the quantity
sold at Batavia to Americans alone  amounted to 91 554  and for the
subsequent years averaged 100 000  pÃ­kuls   and sold for 900 000
Java rupees  or 11 000 l   sterling  The principal part of this was
manufactured at Batavia  the quantity supplied by  JawÃ¢na    JapÃ¢ra
ChÃ©ribon    SurabÃ¡ya   and  SemÃ¡rang   being but proportionally small
till 1803  when  JapÃ¡ra  contributed to the exports of the island in
this article 12 219  In 1804  the same province supplied 21 175 pÃ­kuls
The disadvantage under which the manufacturer laboured  by forced
deliveries at inadequate rates  need not be here insisted on  though
it must be taken into the account in any estimate of the attainable
increase of the manufacture

63  Mr  Hogendorp makes the following observations on the coffee
and pepper of Java    In comparing the produce of the West Indian
islands  according to their proportionate extent  population  and
expenses of cultivation  I have frequently left off in the middle of my
calculations  but I am sure that Java  on a very moderate calculation
can without difficulty yield fifty millions of pounds of coffee
annually

For a long period  the planting of coffee was confined to the Batavian
high and  PriÃ¡ng en  lands  and to  ChÃ©ribon   on the principles of
that short sighted and self destroying policy and spirit of monopoly
by which the company and the government of Batavia have ever been
characterized  It is only of late years that it has been permitted to
extend and revive the cultivation in the eastern districts  But the
Commissioners  in May 1796  ordered that the cultivation should be
abolished  and in the month of September in the same year  this order
was countermanded  and the planting of coffee ordered to be promoted
in the most rigorous manner possible  But what is to be expected from
a country  where the natives are so treated  so oppressed  To day the
Javan is ordered to plant his garden with coffee trees  he does so  and
although well aware how little he will get for the fruit  he sees them
grow up with pleasure  considering their produce as a tribute which
he must pay to his master for enjoyment of protection  but now  when
they are about to bear fruit  he is ordered to root them out  he does
so  and four months afterwards he is again ordered to plant others
Can a more infamous tyranny be imagined  Can it be credited  that any
government should act so madly  so inconsistently  And yet this is
the plain and real truth  But how can stupid ignorance  which by the
vilest means  by base meanness  mercenary marriages  and every kind of
low trick  rises into power and importance  and then becomes by wealth
luxurious  and by flattery intoxicated  act otherwise  And will you
Batavians  continue to trust in such hands as these  your valuable
possessions and interests in India

Pepper grows but slowly on any soil  and is so nice with regard to
it  that in some places  where to all appearance there would be an
abundant produce of the plant  it will not grow at all  The vine
requires four or five years to produce fruit  The improvident Javan
who under the present despotic administration  can and will scarcely
provide for his daily subsistence  finds this too long a delay between
his labour and its reward  having  therefore  no sufficient motive to
pursue the cultivation cheerfully or actively  he can only be driven
to it by force  but let him once experience the advantage of property
in land  let him see the trader ready with plenty of money to purchase
the fruits of his labour  let him  if he should still be idle  observe
his more industrious neighbour acquire wealth  by the sale of those
articles which he slothfully declines to cultivate  and with it
procure the necessaries or conveniences of life  and he will soon be
induced  by emulation and the desire of ameliorating his condition  to
plough and plant his ground  The Island of Java will then produce a
considerable quantity of pepper  for which  if the cultivator obtains
twelve rix dollars per  pÃ­kul   he will be amply paid

Although every thing goes on with difficulty at first  and it
cannot be denied that it will require time and trouble to stimulate
the Javans  who are now confounded  as it were  with tyranny and
oppression  to industry and emulation  it is notwithstanding equally
certain  that an improved system of administration  founded on property
of the soil  freedom of person and trade  would by degrees  though
perhaps much quicker than may be imagined  bring about such a change
and that Java might and would produce as much pepper for exportation
annually as coffee  or about two hundred thousand  pÃ­kuls   which will
bring three thousand six hundred rix dollars into the country

In the year 1801  it was estimated by one of the first commercial
houses in Europe  that the following quantities of pepper might be
obtained from different ports of the Archipelago



PORTS  and  PLACES  where  PEPPER  is to be had     estimated in March
1801

At  Bencoolen   belonging to the English  may be had about twelve
hundred tons of pepper per annum

At  Prince of Wales Island   belonging to the English  may be had at
present only one hundred tons per annum  in a few years it will be five
hundred tons

At  SusÃº   on the west coast of Sumatra  belonging to the King of
Acheen  may be had one thousand tons per annum

At  Acheen  and its ports  belonging to the King of Acheen  may be
had about one thousand tons per annum  the Danes often go to these two
ports

At  Tringano  and  Kalanton   belonging to a Malayan prince  may be
had about two thousand tons per annum  the Europe Portuguese ships
often call at these ports on their way to China

At  Palembang   the Dutch have a small fort here  and oblige the king
to send all his pepper to Batavia  it may be about seven hundred tons
per annum

At  Lampung   on the south point of Sumatra  the Dutch have a small
fort here  and they send all their pepper to Batavia  it may be about
five hundred tons

At  Bantam  may be had five hundred tons  this belongs to the Dutch

At  BÃ¡njer mÃ¡sin   on the south west of Borneo  the Dutch have a fort
here  and the rajah sends all his pepper to Batavia  it may be about
twelve to fifteen hundred tons per annum

At  Chintabun   near Siam  belonging to the King of Siam  may be had
one thousand tons per annum  this goes to China in the king s junks

64   Ceylon  it may be observed  will consume two thousand kÃ³yans
annually  four thousand tons   There is also a ready market at the
Cape of Good Hope  for one thousand kÃ³yans a year  A scarcity of this
grain frequently happens on the coast of Coromandel  when the import
of it from Java will yield great profit  if the traders are permitted
to export it  The general freedom of commerce and navigation  and the
encouragement such freedom holds out to the merchant  will establish
and extend a ready communication and friendly relation between Batavia
and the trading places of India  In the article of rice  Java possesses
advantages superior to Bengal  for although this grain is generally
very cheap there  yet the navigation from and to Bengal is always more
difficult than that from and to Java  from whence  at all seasons
of the year  the passage may be made to most parts of India  and in
Bengal it often happens  that the rice is very scarce and dear  and
even that a famine rages there  On the island of Java  on the contrary
although the crops may sometimes partially fail in a few places  a
general and total failure never happens  at least there is no instance
of it on record  It may also be considered  whether the exportation of
rice from Java to Europe might not become an object of speculation
The cargo of a ship of five hundred lasts  or kÃ³yans  would only cost
fifteen thousand rix dollars  which cannot be reckoned at more than
thirty thousand guilders  and the kÃ³yan being calculated at three
thousand five hundred pounds  the only question would be  what would
be the value of one million seven hundred and fifty thousand pounds
of rice in Europe  and if the undertaking would afford a reasonable
gain  Even China is sometimes much in want of rice  and the export
of it to that country would often  if not always  turn out very
advantageous     Hogendorp

Rice was exported both to England and China  during the provisional
administration of the British government on Java

65  The rupees are throughout calculated at thirty stivers each

66  If current report is to be credited  the fate of this unfortunate
prince has been at last sealed  and the undisputed successor of  that
great and puissant king   to whom Queen Elizabeth gave an assurance
that far from ever having cause to repent an intercourse with the
English  he should have a most real and just cause to rejoice at it
and to whom  on the part of the English nation  she gave a pledge
that her promises were faithful  because the conduct of her subjects
would be prudent and sincere    has been obliged to abdicate his
throne in favour of the son of a Pinang merchant

67   We  the Batavians   says Mr  Hogendorp   or rather our good and
heroic ancestors  conquered these countries by force of arms  The
Javans  who are immediately under our jurisdiction  acknowledge the
Batavian nation or the East India Company as their lord or sovereign
but by so doing  although they resigned their political rights  they
still retained their civil and personal liberty  at least their right
thereto  But what relation do the Chinese bear to us  and what are the
rights they can require from us  As foreigners and itinerant traders
this may be easily defined  but as inhabitants and settlers a further
inquiry becomes necessary  To political rights  or to a share in the
government and revenues of the country  they have not the slightest
claim  and as inhabitants  they cannot even claim the enjoyment of
the same civil or personal privileges as the Javans  in the first
place  because they are not natives of the country  secondly  because
they take no interest in the welfare or preservation of the country
thirdly  because they only endeavour to derive their gain at the
expense of the Europeans as well as the Javans  in order to return to
China with the profits they make  or at least to send as much of it as
possible to their families there  fourthly  because they have no regard
whatever to the welfare of our country  and would be quite indifferent
to the English  or any other nation  driving us from Java  For these
reasons  I conceive that the Chinese have not the same right as the
Javans to the freedom or privilege of citizens  The basis of all civil
communities is incontrovertibly the sacrifice of a part of the liberty
rights  and even property of each individual  for the enjoyment and
security of the remainder  and this remainder  when fixed  forms the
civil freedom and privileges of such a community  Not only are the
Chinese quite exempt from this sacrifice  but they are also  by the
corruption of the Batavian government  much less burdened than all the
other inhabitants  even the Europeans  and are besides favoured with
considerable privileges and exclusive means of gaining wealth  These
are facts  which no one who is acquainted with Batavia can or will
contradict

Were impartial justice to be adhered to  the Chinese would be looked
upon and treated only as foreigners  who are suffered and admitted  as
long as it is not injurious to our interest and safety  to settle in
our country and under our protection  seeking in trade or agriculture
their means of subsistence and emolument  and to whom  on account of
their numbers  it is allowed by our indulgence  as long as they conduct
themselves well and peaceably  to preserve and practise their own
manners and customs  and even in particular places  to dwell together
under their own chiefs

All the Chinese who come to Java every year in such vast numbers  in
the junks from China  or in other vessels from neighbouring places
are the refuse of their nation  and principally from a province  the
natives of which are considered by their own countrymen the worst of
the whole empire  These people come half naked and poor in the extreme
they add  therefore  so many more to the population  which must be
supported by the country  to which however they contribute nothing  It
must be acknowledged  they are  particularly at first  very active
industrious  inventive  and frugal  At Batavia they exercise almost
every useful art  trade  and handicraft  they cultivate and produce the
best vegetables  they work the sugar mills  and appear therefore to be
uncommonly useful and perhaps indispensable

The trade in the interior  wholesale and retail  the trade to sea  to
the opposite shores  and elsewhere in the Straits  is entirely in their
hands  and is almost wholly carried on by them  In all considerable
places on the coast  as well as in the interior of Java  they have
distinct towns  called kampongs  where they live under their own
chiefs  and follow their own customs and manners  Finally  they have
exclusively all the farms of the government taxes and revenues  both
in the Company s districts and in the dominions of the native princes
by which means they are complete masters of all trade  internal and
foreign  and are enabled to make monopolies in every thing  which they
do accordingly in the most extensive manner  The burthens they have
to bear are  on the contrary  very trifling  in fact  almost nothing
especially because they are exempt from all feudal and personal
services  which are so oppressive to the Javans

To what can this impropriety and injustice be ascribed but to the
government of Batavia  The Chinese have obtained all these favours
and privileges by making considerable presents  and thus sacrificing
the interests of the Company and the nation to their selfishness and
avarice  These arbitrary governors of the East Indies have made the
Chinese possessors of Java  for I undertake to prove  that the wealth
of the Chinese on that island amounts to ten times as much as the
property of all the Europeans added together  and that their profits
every year bear the same proportion

With reference to their numbers and character  I am of opinion that
the following resolutions regarding them might be adopted  That the
Chinese on Java should be allowed to remain  and even that further
arrivals of them should be permitted  care being taken  however  to
keep them in good order  that they should be prevented from injuring
the Javans  either by force or fraud  that they be not more favoured
than others  that they should contribute a proportionate and equitable
share towards the revenues of the state for their enjoyment of the
rights of citizenship  in the same manner as other inhabitants  which
can best be effected by means of a capitation tax  Uncultivated and
uninhabited lands might then be granted or sold to the Chinese  as well
as to the natives  to establish sugar mills or plantations  By these
means  every practicable use and advantage would be derived from them
as an industrious and active people  without doing any injury to the
other inhabitants  and especially the Javans as natives of the country
and because they have no interest in our national welfare  they should
be made  as an equitable compensation  to pay a higher rate to the
state  In other respects  they may be completely subjected to our laws
and may be treated with kindness as well as justice

The number of Chinese on Java is much greater than is generally
imagined  and annually more of them arrive by thousands  By connexions
with the native women  their families increase in inconceivable
numbers  These half Chinese retain the language  religion  manners
customs  and even the dress of their fathers  and are generally called
Pernakans  although that name is also frequently applied exclusively
to those Chinese who embrace the Mahometan religion  and these  as a
separate class of people  have their own chiefs  or sometimes confound
themselves with the Javans  and can only be distinguished by their
lighter complexion

68  Among the exports from Java for the Europe market  no particular
notice has been taken in the text of the extent of the spice trade  the
produce of the Moluccas having  during the provisional administration
of the British government  been conveyed direct from Amboina to the
port of London  without being landed and re assorted at Batavia  as was
formerly the case under the Dutch government

The sovereign Prince of the Netherlands has  by a solemn act  abandoned
his right to the feudal services of his native subjects in the Eastern
Archipelago  but has at the same time reserved to the state the
exclusive monopoly of the spices  It may perhaps have been deemed
expedient  in aid of the finances of Great Britain  that this odious
monopoly should have been permitted to remain for upwards of five years
under her uncontrolled dominion  and that  while the cloves on Amboina
were raised by forced services  the nutmeg gardens on Banda should
have been cultivated by slaves  There may have been reasons also which
induced her to continue the system of extirpation in the neighbouring
islands  and to act up to those stipulations for depressing these
unhappy countries  for which the Dutch have in all ages been so justly
reprobated  But now that the sovereign  to whom they are again ceded
has recommenced the Dutch administration in the Eastern seas  with
an appearance of something more like justice  humanity  and sound
policy than we have been in the habit of witnessing for the last two
centuries  it is to be hoped that the profits of two annual cargoes
of spices  whatever they may amount to  will never be considered of
sufficient importance to tempt a great and magnanimous nation longer
to trample on the hallowed rights of humanity  and to persevere in
a system  which  while it may have afforded a temporary profit  has
tended to degrade  depopulate  and destroy the fairest countries in
creation  If the nutmeg and clove trees were allowed to grow where
Providence would seem to have ordained that in their natural course
they should  and this trade were opened to a free commerce  nutmegs
might perhaps be procured as cheap as betel nut  and cloves as cheap as
pepper

In the Spice Islands   observes Adam Smith   the Dutch are said to
burn all the spiceries which a fertile season produces beyond what
they expect to dispose of in Europe  with such a profit as they think
sufficient  In the islands where they have no settlements they give
a premium to those who collect the blossoms and green leaves of the
clove and nutmeg trees which naturally grow there  but which this
savage policy has now  it is said  completely exterminated  Even in the
islands where they have settlements  they have very much reduced  it
is said  the number of those trees  If the produce even of their own
islands was much greater than what suited their market  the natives
they suspect  might find means to convey some part of it to other
nations  and the best way  they imagine  to secure their own monopoly
is to take care that no more shall grow than what they themselves carry
to market  By different acts of oppression  they have reduced the
population of the Moluccas nearly to the number which is sufficient to
supply with fresh provisions and other necessaries of life  their own
insignificant garrisons  and such of their ships as occasionally come
there for a cargo of spices  Under the government of the Portuguese
however  these islands are said to have been tolerably well peopled

Had Dr  Smith written at the present day he might have heightened the
picture by observing  that so far from even being able to supply the
garrisons  these islands have long been considered incapable of raising
sufficient supplies for their own subsistence  they have for many years
depended almost entirely on Java for rice and the common necessaries of
life  and latterly supplies have been sent to them from Bengal

69  This general remark is not intended to apply to the traders of
Pinang  Prince of Wales  Island   who are in general well informed and
most honourable in their dealings  possessing great experience in the
trade  and acquaintance with the habits and character of the natives
but this establishment is comparatively of recent date  and the very
general view here taken has reference to the intercourse which has
subsisted during the last century

late Lieutenant Governor of Prince of Wales  Island

71  GOLD   From a calculation recently made  it appears that the
number of Chinese employed in the gold mines at Mentrada and other
places on the western side of Borneo  amounts to not less than
thirty two thousand working men  When a mine affords no more than
four  bengkals   weighing about two dollars each  or something less
than a  tahil   per man in the year  it is reckoned a losing concern
and abandoned accordingly  Valuing the  bengkal  at eighteen Spanish
dollars  which is a low rate of estimation  and supposing only four
bengkals  produced in the year by the labour of each man  the total
produce is 128 000  bengkals   worth 2 224 000 Spanish dollars  equal
to 556 000 l    at the rate of five shillings the dollar  But it is
asserted  that upon the general run of the mines  seldom less than six
bengkals  per head has been obtained  and in very rainy seasons seven
Taking the medium at six and a half  bengkals   the 32 000 Chinese
will procure 208 000  bengkals   which at eighteen Spanish dollars
the  bengkal  is 3 744 000 Spanish dollars  equal to 936 000 l   Such
is the result of a very moderate calculation of the produce of these
mines  According to an estimate made in the year 1812  the annual
produce of the mines on the west coast of Borneo was estimated at
4 744 000 Spanish dollars  being an excess of a million sterling  The
quantity of gold procured on Sumatra  the supposed golden Chersonesus
of the ancients  is according to Mr  Marsden about 30 800 ounces
which  at 4 l   sterling the ounce  is worth 123 200 l    equal to
492 800 Spanish dollars

With respect to the disposal of the gold from the mines of Borneo  it
may be observed  that every native Chinese  whether employed in the
mines  in agriculture  as merchant or artificer  manages every year to
remit at least the value of one  tahil   more or less  of gold to his
relations in China  These remittances are generally made by the junks
in gold  as it saves freight  is more easily smuggled on shore without
the notice of the rapacious Mandarin  and remitted over land to the
residence of their families  Taking the Chinese male population who can
thus remit at double the number employed in the mines  and supposing
one half to be born in the country  most of whom may not remit to
China  this remittance would amount to 34 000  bengkals  or  tahils
which at eighteen Spanish dollars is 612 000 dollars  or 153 000 l

It is calculated that  one year with another  at least five hundred
Chinese return in the junks to their native country with a competency
Several have been known to take away one thousand  bengkals  of gold
many from three to five hundred  but very few return before they have
cleared a competency of two thousand dollars  or from one hundred to
one hundred and twenty  tahil  of gold  This goes partly in gold
though they prefer investing a part of it in tin from Banka  opium
and other articles  Say  however  that they remit one half in gold
five hundred men  at one thousand dollars each  will give five hundred
thousand dollars  which added to the small family remittances  accounts
for an amount exceeding one million of dollars  or 250 000 l   This
calculation  however  seems to be far within the mark  and gives less
by one half than what is usually stated to be remitted to China from
the Bornean mines  which has been estimated at a loose guess at two
millions of dollars  or 500 000 l

A further amount of not less than the value of a million of dollars
250 000 l    is supposed to find its way annually to Western India
and principally to Bengal   viÃ¢  Batavia  Malacca  and Pinang  for the
purchase of opium and piece goods  The surplus enriches Java and some
of the other islands  in exchange for salt  tobacco  coarse cloths   c

As the mines are worked with so little expence of machinery  the funds
necessary for commencing an undertaking of the kind are small  and
as the property of the soil belongs to the first occupant  almost
every Chinese would become a proprietor  but from the mode by which
their services are  in the first instance  secured by the council of
proprietors or kongsis  A parcel of half starved Chinese  enchanted
with the prospect of wealth on the golden shores of Borneo  readily
find a passage in the annual junks that sail from the mother country to
Borneo  at ten dollars a head  On their arrival  being unable to pay
the passage money  and the tax of a dollar per head  established by the
native authority  while their immediate wants of food  clothing  and
habitation  are urgent and imperious  the proprietors of the mines find
it easy to engage their services for three or four years  In some other
cases  agents are employed to obtain men from China  on stipulated
agreements  to work for a number of years  the usual rate of payment
to the miners so engaged is not considered to average less than five
Spanish dollars a month  No sooner  however  are these engagements
concluded with their masters  than a number of them club together with
the funds they have been able to save  and commence a new mine upon
their joint account  in a few years acquiring a competency to return to
their native country

DIAMONDS   There appears to be no just foundation for the idea  that
the diamonds of Borneo are inferior to those of Golconda  Many of an
inferior quality have no doubt found their way into the market  because
there was perhaps less skill and judgment in the selection  but the
value of diamonds here  as well as every where else  depends upon their
shape  size  and water  and in this respect the diamonds of Borneo will
bear a comparison with those of any country yet known  Indeed  as far
as we may judge from the present state of our information  the LÃ¡ndak
mines alone are as productive  and its diamonds as precious  as any
other in the world

The principal mines where diamonds are regularly dug for on Borneo
and found in any considerable quantities  are those of LÃ¡ndak  SÃ¡ngau
on the great river Lawi  and the districts of BÃ¡njer mÃ¡sin  Diamonds
have been occasionally found within the limits of Borneo Proper  at
MÃ¡tan and SukadÃ¡na  The mines of LÃ¡ndak are as ancient as the Malayan
dominion on the islands  those of SÃ¡ngau are of more recent date  and
those of BÃ¡njer mÃ¡sin are said to have been first discovered in the
reign of Sultan Sepoh  from whom the present sultan is the fourth in
descent

Diamonds are not only found in the bottom of rivers when dry  but at
the foot of craggy hills and mountains  The  pÃ¡rits   or mines  are
dug to the depth of from one to five fathoms only  but experience has
invariably proved  that the deeper they are dug  not only are the
diamonds more abundant  but superior in size  shape  and water  The
soil which produces diamonds is known from a species of earth called
by the natives  lÃ¡bor  or  lÃ¡bor gig gi   This is sometimes black
sometimes white  red  orange  and green  it is a species of earth which
stains the clothes of the labourer  and is distinguished by many names

At LÃ¡ndak there are ten  pÃ¡rits  worked by Chinese  and in each from
twenty to thirty labourers employed  As a general average  eight
Chinese are supposed to find about eight  bengkals  of diamonds in a
year  From two to three hundred of the smallest sort are supposed to go
to a  bengkal   valued at from twenty to twenty four rupees  This is
independent of the larger ones  which are casual  So far back as the
year 1738  the Dutch annually exported from the produce of these mines
diamonds to the value of from two to three hundred thousand dollars

Few courts of Europe could perhaps boast of a more brilliant display
of diamonds than  in the prosperous times of the Dutch  was exhibited
by the ladies of Batavia  the principal and only mart yet opened for
the Bornean diamond mines  and whence those known in the European
world have been procured  With the decline of the Dutch government
however  the demand has decreased  and the mines are now almost
neglected  the numerous diamond cutters not being able to obtain a
livelihood  Formerly  when more Chinese were employed in the mines of
LÃ¡ndak  diamonds from ten to thirteen carats were common in the public
markets  The PangÃ©ran of LÃ¡ndak now wears one of eighteen  and another
of fourteen carats and a half  Since Java has been in the possession
of the English  rough diamonds from Borneo have been sent to England
and  even in a very unfavourable state of the market  turned out an
advantageous remittance

Among the larger diamonds which these mines have produced  it may
not be uninteresting to mention  that the great diamond now in the
possession of the Sultan of MÃ¡tan  which has been seen and examined
by Europeans  weighs three hundred and sixty seven carats  it is of
the shape of an egg indented on one side  It is  however  uncut  and
on this account  it may be difficult to say  whether it will become
the largest cut diamond ever known  for the famous diamond of Aurung
Zebe  called the Mogul  in its rough state weighed seven hundred and
ninety five carats  and was then valued at 600 000 l    but when cut
was reduced to two hundred and seventy nine carats  This celebrated
diamond  known by the name of the MÃ¡tan diamond  was discovered by a
dÃ¡yak  and claimed as a droit of royalty by the Sultan of the country
GÃºru LÃ¡ya  but was handed over to the PangÃ©ran of LÃ¡ndak  whose brother
having got possession of it  gave it as a bribe to the Sultan of
SÃºkadÃ¡na  in order that he might be placed on the throne of LÃ¡ndak
the lawful prince  however  having fled to Bantam  by the aid of the
prince of that country and the Dutch  succeeded in regaining possession
of his district  and nearly destroyed SÃºkadÃ¡na  It has remained as an
heir loom in the family of these princes for four descents  and is
almost the only appendage of royalty now remaining

CHAPTER VI

  Character of the inhabitants of Java  Difference between the
   SÃºndas and the Javans  The Lower Orders  The Chiefs  Nature
   of the Native Government  Different Officers of the
   State  Judicial Establishments and Institutions  Laws  and how
   administered  Police Institutions and Regulations  Military
   Establishments  Revenue


Having  in the foregoing pages  attempted to introduce the inhabitants
of Java to the reader  by an account of their person  their manners
and employment in the principal departments of agriculture
manufactures  and commerce  I shall now endeavour to make him  in some
degree  acquainted with their intellectual and moral character  their
institutions  government  and such other particulars as may contribute
to enable him to form some estimate of their relative rank in the scale
of civilized society

From what has been stated of their progress in the manufacturing and
agricultural arts  their general advancement in knowledge may be easily
estimated  There are no establishments for teaching the sciences  and
there is little spirit of scientific research among them  The common
people have little leisure or inclination for improving their minds or
acquiring information  but they are far from being deficient in natural
sagacity or docility  Their organs are acute and delicate  their
observation is ready  and their judgment of character is generally
correct  Like most Eastern nations  they are enthusiastic admirers
of poetry  and possess a delicate ear for music  Though deficient in
energy  and excited to action with difficulty  the effect probably of
an enervating climate and a still more enervating government  they
are capable of great occasional exertion  and sometimes display a
remarkable perseverance in surmounting obstacles or enduring labours
Though ignorant and unimproved  they are far from wanting intelligence
in the general objects of their pursuit  and frequently astonish
Europeans by the ingenuity of their expedients  and the facility with
which they accomplish difficult operations by apparently inadequate
means

People in a rude state of society are not always prepared to admit
their inferiority  or inclined to adopt manifest improvements  what
is much beyond their skill or their power  may excite their wonder
but does not always tempt their imitation  This is more peculiarly
the case  where national pride or religious prejudice stand in the
way  and the contempt of unbelievers  with which the Mahomedan system
inspires its votaries  leads them usually to undervalue the arts
in which others excel  or the instruction which they communicate
The Javans  though far from deficient in national pride  and though
Mahomedans  are free from this senseless and pernicious prejudice  and
are ready to acknowledge the superiority of the Europeans  as well
as disposed to imitate their arts and to obey their direction  No
people can be more tractable  and although their external appearance
indicates listlessness and sometimes stupidity  none possess a quicker
apprehension of what is clearly stated  or attain a more rapid
proficiency in what they have a desire to learn  The restraints under
which conversation labours by the necessity of using different dialects
in addressing different orders of society  as well as the respect paid
to superiority of rank  prevents them from such a frequent intercourse
of thought and opinion as might otherwise be expected  and often
renders them  to appearance  reserved and taciturn  although in fact
they are social  cheerful  and good humoured

An uninstructed people are often credulous  and the Javans are
remarkable for their unsuspecting and almost infantine credulity
Susceptible of every impression that artifice may attempt to make upon
them  and liable to every delusion propagated by the prejudiced or the
designing  they not inaptly compare themselves to a piece of pure white
cloth  on which any dye or shade of colour may be laid  They lend an
easy credence to omens  to prognostics  to prophets  and to quacks
They easily become the dupes of any religious fanatic  and credit
without scruple or examination  his claim to supernatural powers  Their
profession of Mahomedanism has not relieved them from the superstitious
prejudices and observances of an anterior worship  they are thus open
to the accumulated delusion of two religious systems

They are great observers of lucky or unlucky days  or natural
phenomena  and undertake no journey or enterprize without attending
to them  It is unlucky to go any where on the day that you hear of
the death of a friend  the sight of two crows fighting in the air is
unlucky  two small birds  called  prenjak   fighting near a house
afford a prognostic of the arrival of a friend from a distance
Explosions or noises heard from the mountains not only excite terror
for their immediate consequences  but are thought to forebode some
great calamity  unconnected with the convulsions of nature  of which
they are the symptoms  such as a sanguinary war  a general famine
or an epidemic sickness  The eclipses of the sun and moon powerfully
excite this superstitious spirit  and induce many absurd notions and
observations  Earthquakes furnish certain prognostics  according to the
day of the month on which they happen  In none of their superstitions
however  is there any thing of that gloomy  dark  or malignant cast
which distinguishes those of less favoured climates or of more savage
tribes

Although  on many occasions  listless and unenterprising  their
religious enthusiasm is no sooner excited  than they become at once
adventurous and persevering  esteeming no labour arduous  no result
impossible  and no privation painful  We witnessed an instance  both
of their simplicity and of their energy  connected with this part of
their character  which excited our astonishment  The population of some
of the districts of  BÃ¡nyumÃ¡s  contributed their voluntary labour  in
1814  to the construction of a broad high road  from the base to the
summit of one of the loftiest mountains on the island  the mountain
SÃºmbing    and this extraordinary public work was almost completed
before intelligence of its commencement reached the government  It
was in consequence examined  and found to be a work of immense labour
and care  but without the least appearance of object or utility  Upon
enquiring into the motive of such a singular undertaking  it was learnt
that a general belief prevailed  that there was a very holy man at the
top of the mountain  who would not come down till there should be a
good road made for him  The  MadÃºrese  are said to believe  that the
spirits of the dead revisit the earth  but this does not appear to be a
Javan superstition

Their prejudices are neither very numerous nor unyielding  and seem
generally to have originated in some laudable feeling or amiable
weakness  Their nationality  which is very strong  although it delights
in the traditionary narratives of ancient Javan exploits  and supports
a hope of future independence  which they are not backward to express
does not lead them to despise the character  or to undervalue the acts
of strangers  They have a contempt for trade  and those of higher rank
esteem it disgraceful to be engaged in it  but the common people are
ever ready to engage in the labours of agriculture  and the chiefs
to honour and encourage agricultural industry  Those of the highest
rank and greatest authority  generally attend at the opening of new
sÃ¡wah  fields  performing part of the work with their own hands  and
leading their inferiors or dependents  as they express it  to pay
respect to the earth  in whose honour they also observe annually the
sedÃ©ka bÃºmi   or feast to the earth  It is in the same spirit that
the buffalo  as the chief assistant of the husbandman  is viewed with
such peculiar regard  that in some of the interior districts  new born
infants are sometimes carried to be breathed upon by them  from a
superstitious belief that such a ceremony will render them fortunate

Notwithstanding the despotic nature of their government  and the
feudal principles on which it rests  the Javan must be considered as
a patriarchial people  still retaining many of the virtues  and all
the simplicity  which distinguish that state of society  Their village
settlements constitute detached societies  under their local chief
and priest  and the same internal concord prevails in these little
associations which characterises patriarchial tribes  Vicinity and
daily intercourse afford opportunities of conferring real assistance
and acts of kindness  injustice and even violence may sometimes
be committed against the inhabitants of other villages  but very
seldom by the inhabitants of the same village against each other
The patriarchial spirit of the Javans may be further traced  in the
veneration which they pay to age  the respect and acquiescence with
which they receive the maxims or the counsels of experience  the
ready contented submission which they shew to the commands of their
immediate superiors  the warmth of their domestic attachments  and the
affectionate reverence with which they regard and protect the tombs and
the ashes of their fathers  To the same description of feelings may be
referred that consideration for ancestry  that attention to the line of
descent  and that regard to the history and merits of distant kindred
which in the meanest people appears often to assume the character of
family pride

These observations apply principally to the inhabitants of villages
at some distance from the seats of the princes or regents  and the
contagion of the larger capitals  and more particularly to the people
of the  SÃºnda  districts  Those of higher rank  those employed about
court  or in administering to the pleasures or luxuries of the great
those collected into the capitals or engaged in the public service
are frequently profligate and corrupt  exhibiting many of the vices of
civilization without its refinement  and the ignorance and deficiencies
of a rude state without its simplicity  The people in the neighbourhood
of Batavia are the worst in the Island  and the long intercourse with
strangers has been almost equally fatal to the morals of the lower
part of Bantam  The population collected at the native capitals is
naturally influenced  to a certain extent  by the vices of the court
but the further they are removed from European influence and foreign
intercourse  the better are their morals and the happier are the people

In attempting to exhibit some of the more striking features of the
Javan character  it becomes necessary to distinguish between the
privileged classes of society and the mass of the people  Long
continued oppression may have injured the character of the latter
and obliterated some of its brighter traits  but to the former  the
constant exercise of absolute dominion has done a more serious injury
by removing every salutary restraint on the passions  and encouraging
the growth of rank and odious vices  In the peasantry we observe
all that is simple  natural  and ingenuous  in the higher orders we
sometimes discover violence  deceit  and gross sensuality

Where not corrupted by indulgence on the one hand  or stupified by
oppression on the other  the Javans appear to be a generous and
warm hearted people  In their domestic relations they are kind
affectionate  gentle  and contented  in their public  they are
obedient  honest  and faithful  In their intercourse with society
they display  in a high degree  the virtues of honesty  plain dealing
and candour  Their ingenuousness is such  that as the first Dutch
authorities have acknowledged  prisoners brought to the bar on criminal
charges  if really guilty  nine times out of ten confess  without
disguise or equivocation  the full extent and exact circumstances of
their offences  and communicate  when required  more information on the
matter at issue than all the rest of the evidence  Although this may
in some degree  be the result of the former use of torture  it cannot
be wholly so

Though not much addicted to excess  and of rather a slow temperament
they are in general liberal and expensive  according to their means
seldom hoarding their wealth  or betraying a penurious disposition
Fond of show and pomp  they lay out all their money  as soon as it
is acquired  in the purchase of articles of dress  horses  splendid
trappings   c   but they possess a quality which is not always joined
with a love of splendour  either in nations or individuals  they are
cleanly in their persons  and pay the greatest attention to neatness
as well as to glare and finery

Hospitality is universal among them  it is enjoined by their most
ancient institutions  and practised with readiness and zeal  The Javans
are exceedingly sensible to praise or shame 74   and ambitious of power
and distinction  but their national oppressions or agricultural habits
have rendered them somewhat indifferent to military glory  and deprived
them of a great portion of their ancient warlike energy  They are
more remarkable for passive fortitude than active courage  and endure
privations with patience  rather than make exertions with spirit and
enterprize

Though living under a government where justice was seldom administered
with purity or impartiality  and where  of course  we might expect to
see the hand of private violence stretched out to punish private wrong
or a general spirit of retaliation and insidious cruelty prevailing
the Javans are  in a great degree  strangers to unrelenting hatred and
blood thirsty revenge  Almost the only passion that can urge them to
deeds of vengeance or assassination  is jealousy  The wound given to
a husband s honour by seducing his wife  is seldom healed  the crime
seldom forgiven  and what is remarkable  the very people who break the
marriage tie on the slightest caprice  or the most vague pretence
are yet uncommonly watchful over it while it remains entire  They
are little liable to those fits and starts of anger  or those sudden
explosions of fury  which appear among northern nations  To this remark
have been brought forward as exceptions  those acts of vengeance
proceeding from an irresistible phrenzy  called  mucks   where the
unhappy sufferer aims at indiscriminate destruction  till he himself is
killed like a wild beast  whom it is impossible to take alive  It is a
mistake  however  to attribute these acts of desperation to the Javans

That such have occurred on Java  even during the British
administration  is true  but not among the Javans  they have happened
exclusively in the large towns of Batavia   SemÃ¡rang   and  SurabÃ¡ya
and have been confined almost entirely to the class of slaves  This
phrenzy  as a crime against society  seems  if not to have originated
under the Dutch  certainly at least to have been increased during their
administration  by the great severity of their punishments  For the
slightest fault  a slave was punished with a severity which he dreaded
as much as death  and with torture in all its horrid forms before his
eyes  he often preferred to rush on death and vengeance

Atrocious crimes are extremely rare  and have been principally owing
to misgovernment when they have occurred  In answer to what has been
asserted concerning robberies  assassinations  and thefts  it may be
stated  that during the residence of the English  an entire confidence
was reposed in the people  and that confidence was never found
misplaced  The English never used bars or bolts to their houses  never
travelled with arms  and no instance occurred of their being ill used
The Dutch  on the contrary  placed no confidence  all their windows
were barred  and all their doors locked  to keep out the treacherous
natives  as they called them   and they never moved five miles abroad
without pistols and swords  What could be expected by a government that
derived a principal part of its revenue by the encouragement of vice
by the farms of gaming  cock fighting  and opium shops  After the two
former were abolished by the English  and the local government had done
all in its power to discourage the latter  a visible amelioration took
place in the morals of the lower ranks

Hordes of banditti  formidable for their numbers and audacity  formerly
infested some parts of the country  particularly the provinces of
Bantam and ChÃ©ribon  but since they have been dispersed by the strong
hand of government  the roads of Java may be travelled in as much
security as those of England

Much has been said of the indolence of the Javans  by those who
deprived them of all motives for industry  I shall not again repeat
what I have formerly on several occasions stated on this subject  but
shall only enter a broad denial of the charge  They are as industrious
and laborious as any people could be expected to be  in their
circumstances of insecurity and oppression  or as any people would be
required to be  with their advantages of soil and climate  If they do
not labour during the whole day  it is because such persevering toil
is unnecessary  or would bring them no additional enjoyments  The best
refutation of the charge of indolence is to be found in the extent of
their cultivation  the well dressed appearance of their rice fields
and the abundant supplies of their harvests  They generally rise by
daylight  at half past six they go out to the rice fields  where they
employ their buffaloes till ten  when they return home  bathe  and
refresh themselves with a meal  During the violent heat of the noon
they remain under the shade of their houses or village trees  making
baskets  mending their implements of husbandry  or engaged in other
necessary avocations  and at about four return to the  sÃ¡wahs  to
labour them  without buffaloes or other cattle  At six they return to
their homes  sup  and spend the remainder of their time till the hour
of rest  which is generally between eight and nine  in little parties
for amusement or conversation  when the whole village becomes a scene
of quiet content and pleasure  The same round of toil and relaxation
is observed during the season for garden culture  dry field labour  or
other employments

Under this system  the villagers seem to enjoy a greater degree of
happiness than they could derive from those increased means that would
result from increased exertion  I can bear testimony to their general
cheerfulness  contentedness  and good humour  for having visited their
villages at all seasons  and often when least expected or entirely
unknown  I have always found them either pleased and satisfied with
their lot when engaged at their work  or social and festive in their
hours of pleasure  One observation generally made and admitted  would
seem to militate against this part of the Javan character  they are
remarked to be envious and jealous of one another s success  but if
this trait of character be with difficulty reconciled to their general
reputation for contentedness and benevolence  it is surely still more
inconsistent with that indolent apathy with which they are often
charged

It will appear throughout their history  that when strongly excited by
the animosities of the constant wars in which they were engaged  they
were frequently guilty of acts of great barbarity  such as decapitating
a vanquished enemy  and kicking his head about like a football  In
war and politics  much is not to be said in their favour  stratagem
and intrigue being relied upon in preference to discipline  courage
or good faith  even the Chinese  during what is called the Chinese
war on Java  A D  1750   would appear to deserve a higher character
for bravery and good faith than the Javans  But it is reasonable
to attribute this  in some measure  to the degrading influence of
European despotism  A great disregard for the  little people  is shewn
throughout their political history  as is particularly exemplified in
the instance of a mock battle that was fought between the Chinese and
Javans  near  SemÃ¡rang   in order to impose upon the Dutch  The Chinese
wished to know how they should act upon the occasion   Attack the whole
army of the Javans by surprize   said the Javan negotiators   but be
careful not to kill any of the chiefs or great people  and it will be a
sham fight

Of their nationality it may be observed  that ever since the first
arrival of Europeans  they have neglected no opportunity of attempting
to regain their independence  A reference to the chapters on history
will be sufficient to illustrate this  as well as to shew the national
feeling on the encroachments and assumptions of their European rulers
In the great cause of national independence all would unite  but they
seem hardly to be sufficiently advanced in civilization to effect such
an object  without the risk of relapsing into many barbarities  from
the practice of which they have been weaned  by a long continuance of
established government and general tranquillity  Quiet and peaceable as
the Javans now are  were they once roused to insurrection  their blood
would rapidly boil  and they would no doubt be guilty of many excesses

I might illustrate the Javan character still further by a comparison
of it with the Malayan  by shewing  from the remains of those customs
that are to be referred to an anterior and milder system  how much it
has been altered by the introduction of Mahomedanism  and by giving
an estimate of the effects produced upon it by the government of the
Dutch  but this would anticipate some observations which will be more
appropriate in other parts of this work

Of the causes which have tended to lower the character of the Asiatics
in comparison with Europeans  none has had a more decided influence
than polygamy  To all those noble and generous feelings  all that
delicacy of sentiment  that romantic and poetical spirit  which
virtuous love inspires in the breast of an European  the Javan is a
stranger  and in the communication between the sexes he seeks only
convenience  and little more than the gratification of an appetite
But the evil does not stop here  education is neglected and family
attachments are weakened  Among the privileged orders  the first
wife is generally selected by the friends of the party  from motives
of interest  and to strengthen family alliances  and the second is
rather to be considered as the object of the husband s choice  But if
his circumstances admit of it  he has no scruple to entertain other
women as concubines  who hold an honourable rank in his household  The
progeny from these connections is often immense  It has already been
stated  that a Javan chief has been known to have upwards of sixty
acknowledged children  and it too often happens  that in such cases
sons having been neglected in their infancy  become dissipated  idle
and worthless  and spring up like rank grass and overrun the country
or serve but to fill up a long and useless retinue  Fortunately for
the peasantry  who are the mass of the population  they have escaped
this deteriorating institution  and perhaps much of the comparative
superiority of the character of the peasantry over that of the higher
orders is to be attributed to this advantage  The higher orders have
also been more exposed to the influence of Mahomedanism and European
innovation  and if the former has removed from their usages some traits
of barbarism  and tended to the developement of their intellectual
qualities  it has introduced Mahomedan vices  and the European power
having gradually obtained its supremacy over the island  rather by
stratagem and intrigue than by open conquest  it is probable that
the necessity under which the natives found themselves to resist its
encroachments by similar means  has powerfully contributed to corrupt
their natural ingenuousness  It is not at the court of the sovereign
penned up as he now is  and kept like a bird in a cage by the intrigues
and power of the European authority  that we are to look for the
genuine character of the people  neither is it among those numerous
chiefs and petty chiefs attendant on the European authorities  who by
continual association have  in a great degree  assimilated with them
What we have said of the Javans must therefore be considered  as more
particularly applicable to the peasantry or cultivators  who compose
three fourths of the whole population  and is to be received with some
reserve in its application to the higher classes

Thus far I have given a faithful representation of the people as they
appeared to me  but it may be amusing to the reader to read the Javan
character  as transcribed from the impressions of the Dutch  The
following is an official account 75  of this people given by a subject
of that nation  which has contributed so much to depress and degrade
them

If the Javan is a person of rank  or in affluent circumstances
he will be found superstitious  proud  jealous  vindictive  mean
and slavish towards his superiors  haughty and despotic towards his
inferiors and those unfortunate beings that are subject to his orders
lazy and slothful

The lower class is indolent and insensible beyond conception  and
although certain persons  who presume to be perfectly acquainted with
the character of the Javan  maintain the contrary  still I am convinced
by daily experience  that the Javan in general is most shockingly lazy
and that nothing but fear of his superior  and apprehension of being
punished  or momentary distress or want  can compel him to labour  If
left to himself  he will do no more than what is absolutely requisite
to furnish the necessaries of life  and as he needs but little  his
labour is proportionate  yet as soon as he has a sufficiency for four
days  or for the next day only  nothing will put him in motion again
but force or fear

Cowardly  vindictive  treacherous  inclined to rob and to murder
rather than work  cunning in evil practices  and unaccountably stupid
supposed intentionally   if any good is required of him  These are the
principal traits of the Javan character

The  MalÃ¡yu   speaking of him as an inhabitant of this island  because
I am unacquainted with the character of those living at a distance  is
possessed of a little more courage and activity  fond of small trade
and travelling  and but seldom a robber like the Javan  whom in other
respects he very much resembles  A  MalÃ¡yu   who is a little cunning
will  as soon as an opportunity offers  commit a fraud  especially when
he has had some loss which he wishes to retrieve

Others of the colonists  and some particularly who are likely to have
greater influence with the restored government  entertained more
correct  because more favourable opinions of the Javans  coinciding
nearly with those which I have stated as my own

The following extracts are intended to convey some notion of Javan
ethics  The first is from a popular work  called  Raja Kapa kapa  76

It is incumbent upon every man of condition to be well versed in the
history of former times  and to have read all the chirÃ­ta  written
compositions  of the country  first  the different  RÃ¡ma   the  B rata
yÃºdha    ArjÃºna wijÃ¡ya    BÃ­ma sÃºchi   secondly  the different
accounts of  Panji   thirdly  the  JÃºgÃºl mÃºda    PralÃ¡mbang   and
JÃ¡ya langkÃ¡ra   also to know their different tunes  as well as the
mode of striking the  gÃ¡melan   he must know how to count the years
months  and days  and comprehend the  SangkÃ¡la   understand the  KÃ¡wi
language  and also must be clever in all

And he must also be skilled in horsemanship  and in the management of
an elephant  and have courage to destroy all bad men  and drive away
all women of loose character

The  NÃ­ti sÃ¡stra  is a work of the greatest celebrity on Java  the
original is in the  KÃ¡wi  language  but there are many versions  The
following is translated from a modern version in the present language
of Java

  Praise be to  BatÃ¡ra GÃºru   who is all powerful  to  BatÃ¡ra
   Vishnu  wÃ­snu    who purifieth the minds of men  and to  BatÃ¡ra
   SÃºria   who enlighteneth the world  May they render their divine
   assistance to the author who composeth this work   NÃ­ti SÃ¡stra
   which contains an account of the truths to be found in the sacred
   writings  and which are highly necessary to be known by all
   public officers

  A man who cannot regulate his conduct according to circumstances
   and to the situation in which he may be placed  is like unto
   a man who has lost the senses of taste  and enjoyeth not the
   advantage of  sÃ­ri   for such a man doth not shine in the world
   however fair may be his appearance

  A man who is ignorant of the sacred writings  is as one who has
   lost his speech  for when these become the conversation of other
   men  he will be under the necessity of remaining silent

  It is an abomination to the Divinity to worship him in an unclean
   place  and the man who does so may be compared to one who eats
   another man s bread without his consent  The food is unwholesome
   to him  even as if he ate of his own bread with aversion  in
   which case he resembles the poor man who overeats himself and
   afterwards suffers from hunger

  A woman who takes not a husband until her hair becomes grey and
   her teeth fall out  is despicable in her own eyes  because men
   will no longer feel any inclination to her

  A man  to be accounted able  must know how to adapt his words
   to his actions and his actions to his words  so that he may
   give offence to no one  but render himself agreeable to his
   companions  he must also know how to command in war  and to
   inspire his followers with courage

  In order to obtain this distinction  a man must conduct himself
   towards his equals even as a lover conducts himself towards his
   mistress  for as the lover cannot obtain his object without
   flattery and indulgence  so must we strive to obtain the good
   will of mankind by flattering them occasionally  and by indulging
   them in those things to which they are most inclined  and which
   consists  if we are in company with religious men  in treating of
   religious matters  and if in company with warriors  in treating
   about war  This will not only make them like us the better  but
   at the same time  excite them to excel in their profession

  The subtle nature of the snake  and the venom of its poison  as
   well as the ferocious disposition of the tiger  may be removed
   by sympathetic remedies  the wild elephant may also be tamed by
   means of the well known small iron hook  but the fierceness of
   the warrior  when once in close engagement  is not to be tamed
   unless his enemy surrender  and even then not entirely  for
   although the vanquished surrender  it is to be inferred that he
   still harbours resentment for the loss of his freedom  and the
   conqueror must keep a lively watch over the vanquished  lest he
   still oppose him

  It is well known that waters  however deep  may be fathomed  but
   the thoughts of men cannot be sounded  In order to know the
   nature of another  we must attentively observe his appearance
   his manner of speaking  and his judgment  and if a man gives
   himself out as a holy man  it must be proved by his observance
   of the service of the Deity and his knowledge of the sacred
   writings

  Such a man is distinguished  who is able to expound all abstract
   expressions

  A rich man  who maketh not use of his riches in procuring for
   himself good food and clothing  is an abomination  and ought not
   to be admitted into the society of the learned or men of rank
   neither ought a man  who has learnt a profession or studied
   religion  but who still continues attached to his idle and
   vicious propensities

  The man who advances in years  and he who is too lazy to labour
   and does nothing but eat and sleep  is like a sheep  which is
   useless except on account of its flesh

  It is said  that neither the ravens nor the  gadÃ¡rbo  birds  are
   good for man  but much less are such men who having once embraced
   a holy life  return to worldly pursuits  or such as can find
   it in their hearts to seduce the wives and daughters of their
   friends to commit adultery

  The water in a vessel which is only partly full will by the least
   agitation splash on the sides  experience also proves  that the
   cow which has the loudest voice gives the least milk  So it is
   with men  those who have least understanding or wealth make the
   greatest noise and show  but in reality they are inferior  and
   all they say and do vanisheth like smoke

  Friends must be faithful and forbearing towards each other
   otherwise the consequences will be fatal to both  Of this we have
   an example in the fable of the tiger and the forest

  The forest and the tiger lived together in close friendship  so
   that no one could approach the forest  for the tiger was always
   in the way  nor the tiger  for the forest always afforded him
   shelter  Thus they remained both undisturbed  on account of the
   mutual security they afforded to each other  but when the tiger
   abandoned the forest and roamed abroad  the people seeing that
   the tiger had quitted it  immediately cut down the forest and
   converted it into plantations  the tiger  in the meantime  taking
   shelter in a village  was seen by the people  who soon found
   means to kill him  In this manner  both parties  by abandoning
   their mutual duties to each other  were lost

  A child ought  in every respect  to follow in the footsteps of its
   father  but this is seldom the case  either among men or animals
   in general  Among the latter  however  there are three sorts
   which follow their parents in every respect  all kinds of fish
   frogs  and tortoises  The first and second spawn in water  which
   is carried away until the young are produced  when they again
   join their parents  the last lay their eggs in holes  and as soon
   as the young are hatched they follow the old ones into the water

  Man  although he is borne in his mother s womb a long time  and
   after his birth is taken care of and nourished  still seldom
   follows in the footsteps of his parents  If his father is a holy
   man  he ought to follow the same profession  but instead of this
   children do not generally attend to the advice of their parents
   nor to the lessons of the sacred writings  or those given by holy
   or good men

  That men of rank should do every thing in their power to attach
   the lower class of people to them  is not only proper but
   necessary  in order to keep them faithfully to their duty  To
   this end  therefore  men of rank ought to be indulgent and
   liberal towards their inferiors  like a woman who implores the
   assistance of man to bring forth children and support her  but
   not like a tigress that brings forth its cubs  nor the snake
   which brings forth so many young  that sometimes having no food
   for them or for herself  she devours them

  Man is pleased with the  dÃ³dot  cloth  apparel   and women are
   proud of their bosom  but a good man prefers the sacred writings
   which may lead him to the life to come

  Property obtained by man s own labour is valuable  but more
   valuable is that which is obtained by a man s blood in time of
   war  of less value is property inherited from a man s parents  Of
   little value is the property taken from a man s parents or his
   wife  but still less valuable is that which comes to a man from
   his children

  It is the duty of the chief of the nation to inquire into every
   thing which can affect his subjects  to know whether they are
   prosperous or not  if every one attends to his duty  if they are
   skilful in the execution of it or not  and in all cases to take
   measures accordingly  never losing sight of justice  He must
   as far as possible  be lenient in the punishment of the guilty
   and liberal in the reward of the deserving  particularly in the
   field of battle  when in sight of the enemy  when presents ought
   then to be distributed to the soldiers   prajÃºrit    in order
   to animate them  for if ever so justly treated  they will not
   except they have been obliged by their commander  either be so
   faithful  or risk so much in an attack against the enemy

  Highly prejudicial is it for the chiefs to discover fear before
   their enemies  for in that case the men will also be afraid  but
   when the chiefs conduct themselves in such a manner as to shew
   they do not fear the enemy  then the men are animated by their
   example

  A chief should keep his plan of attack as secret as possible
   because the knowledge of it may enable the enemy to be on his
   guard  and turn the measures taken to his own advantage  He ought
   not to challenge his enemy to give battle  as in that case the
   enemy will have an opportunity of preparing himself for the same
   but he should attempt to surprize him  and rush upon him like
   a fire  that quickly and without much noise consumeth all with
   which it comes in contact

  The most formidable enemy of a man is his own conscience  which
   always brings his crimes before his eyes  without leaving him the
   means of avoiding it

  The most valuable and lasting friendship is that which exists
   between persons of the same rank

  The severest misfortune which a man can suffer  is to be deprived
   by force  of the land upon which he lives and which he has
   cultivated  or to have his wife and children taken from him by
   force

  Man loveth nothing more than his own children  and he always
   esteems his own feelings in preference to those of others

  Of all birds the  chÃ­ong   miner  is the most highly prized
   because it has a beautiful appearance and can imitate the speech
   of man

  A woman who loves her husband so tenderly  that at his death she
   wishes to die with him  or surviving never marries again  but
   lives as if she were dead to the world  is valued above all
   others of her sex

  The lessons of our parents are like the lessons of the ten wise
   masters  No master con be called wise  unless he attends to
   what is written  as well on sacred as on worldly subjects  Such
   a master may be justly called a superior mortal  for it is a
   difficult task to learn and to attend to the same  even as
   difficult as to catch and tame a wild elephant on the edge of a
   precipice without injury

  Melancholy is it to see a young man of condition unacquainted with
   the sacred writings  for  be he ever so gracefully formed or
   elegant in his manners  he remains defective  like the  wÃºrawÃ¡ri
   flower  which  notwithstanding its fine appearance and bright red
   colour  emits no fragrance whatever

  No man can be called good or bad  until his actions prove him so
   Thus if a man declares that he has never taken any but delicious
   food  it will be shewn in his appearance  If he is stout and well
   looking  then may he be credited  but if  on the contrary  he is
   poor and lean  then it is impossible that he should have lived on
   good food

  In like manner  when a man pretends to be the friend of mankind
   it must be proved by his behaviour when he receives the visits of
   others  If he receives his guests with kindness and hospitality
   then is he the friend of mankind  otherwise he is not so  And
   further  if a man pretends to have fasted and prayed  and to have
   become a holy man  it will be known whether he is really so
   by the success which attends the prayers which he puts up for
   another  if the Deity hears them not  then is he a deceiver

  A caterpillar has its poison in its head  a scorpion in its tail
   and a snake in its teeth  but it is unknown in what part of the
   body the poison of man is concealed  a bad man is therefore
   considered poisonous in his whole frame

  A child which is indulged by its parents in every thing  is like
   a young fish in a clear and pure stream  in which it grows and
   sports  unconscious whither it may lead

  As the strength of a bird is in its wings  so does the power of a
   prince consist in his subjects  but then only through the means
   of persons properly informed on the following points  First  how
   a country ought to be properly administered  secondly  how to
   please a prince  thirdly  how to prepare all delicacies for him
   and fourthly  how to preserve discipline and direct the conduct
   of an army

  The dread of the subject should be such  that the orders of the
   prince should be to him like a clap of thunder  that may be heard
   far and wide

  A man who does evil to his companions acts against the sacred
   writings and the lessons of his instructor  he can never
   enjoy prosperity  but will meet with misfortunes in all his
   proceedings  Such a man is like a piece of porcelain  which when
   it falls to the ground breaks into many pieces and can never be
   rendered perfect

  A field without pasture is not frequented by cattle  neither does
   a river without water contain fish  An instructor who knoweth
   not how to perform the duties of his situation can have but few
   disciples  and a prince who pays little regard to his country and
   subjects  will in time not only lose his fame and glory  but his
   authority also

  It is well known that a man cannot take the goods of this world
   with him to the grave  and that man after this life is punished
   with heaven or hell  according to the merits of his actions in
   this life  a man s duty  therefore  requires of him to remember
   that he must die  and if he has been merciful and liberal in
   this life to the poor  he will be rewarded hereafter  Happy is
   the man who divides his property equally between himself and the
   indigent  who feeds the poor and clothes the naked  and relieves
   all who are in distress  he has hereafter to expect nothing but
   good

  The following animals  as being injurious to the health of man
   are not proper to be used by him as food  rats  dogs  frogs
   snakes  worms  monkeys  lizards  and the like

  A handsome man is an ornament to the community  and one that has
   good manners besides  is an ornament to his prince  but he who
   understands the sacred writings is the pride of the community and
   a delight to his prince

  A prince who wishes to know his subjects well  ought to be
   attentive to their manners  actions  and courage  and as gold
   is known by the touchstone  or broken into pieces in order to
   ascertain its intrinsic value  so ought a prince to try his
   subjects  before he intrust them with the charge of his women
   or treasure  and make himself acquainted with their valour and
   knowledge  for a person who does not possess the qualifications
   required for this purpose  is unworthy to associate with people
   of condition  and much less to be the servant of a prince

  If a man violates the law  he may for the first offence be
   punished by a pecuniary fine  for the second by punishment
   affecting his person  but for the third offence he may be
   punished with death

  A joy generally followed by sorrow is that which we feel in
   borrowing money  We feel happy in having obtained what we wished
   but as soon as our creditors come for their money  our joy is
   converted into grief  and that is the greatest when the money is
   spent  and we have not wherewith to satisfy our creditors  then
   arise quarrels and ill will  and yet no sooner are these settled
   than we again have recourse to the old habit of lending and
   borrowing

  Laughing and joking at our companions is also a bad custom  for it
   generally begets quarrels  and is thus the cause of grief

  Should medicine be mixed with poison  we would naturally separate
   the poisonous parts before we swallowed it  and we would also
   clean rusty metal in time before it becomes rusty and corroded
   In the same manner we should distinguish between the good and bad
   actions of man  rewarding knowledge and opposing evil  and be it
   recollected  that a woman  however low her birth  if her manners
   are amiable and her person good  may without impropriety be made
   the wife of a great man

  Riches only tend to torment the mind of man  and sometimes even
   to death  they are therefore  with justice  disregarded and
   despised by the wise  They are collected with pain and troubles
   in afterwards administering them  for if we neglect to watch
   them properly  thieves will come and steal them  and the loss
   occasions as much grief as the point of death

  Therefore is it advisable to give part of our property to the poor
   and indigent  who will thence naturally become under obligations
   to us  and not only assist in guarding our property against
   all accidents  but pray that our property may increase  being
   themselves interested in our success  and our names will be
   blessed by our children and grandchildren

  As dykes cannot long resist the force of water  unless the water
   is allowed a free current and a place to pass through  so riches
   cannot long be enjoyed  unless employed for charitable purposes
   but  on the contrary  they will turn to the injury of the
   possessor  both here and hereafter  who will be exposed to the
   wrath of all the nine deities

   BatÃ¡ra gÃºru  is cool  still colder is the moon  but the coolness
   of neither is to be compared to that which is instilled by the
   voice of a holy man  Fire is hot  still hotter is the sun  but
   neither is to be compared to the heat of a man s heart

  Like those flies and birds  which fly in the air to procure food
   and still continue to feed on filth and dirt  is the man of bad
   character  for although he may have the means of procuring an
   honest subsistence  still will he continue to take what he should
   not  by unlawful means  to the prejudice of others  But a good
   man wishes the success of another  and is happy when his brother
   prospers

  As the moon and stars enlighten the night  and the sun
   enlighteneth the day  so do the Holy Scriptures enlighten the
   hearts of men  and a son who is superior in knowledge to his
   father  is a light to his family

  A child accustomed to nothing but amusement  neglects the lessons
   of its parents  The child on this account  often abandoned to its
   fate  becomes a dangerous subject  it is therefore essential that
   a child should be kept under subjection while it is yet time to
   prevent its committing any bad acts  For this purpose these rules
   should be attended to

  A child under five years of age may be indulged in many things
   but afterwards it must be kept under strict subjection  and
   instructed in the knowledge of the Holy Writings until its tenth
   year  when a commencement may be made to instil that sort of
   knowledge which will form the intellects for the benefit of
   society  After the sixteenth year further instruction must be
   given in the higher and more important branches of knowledge

  Man should always be on his guard against the commission of wicked
   acts  for the end of them is always pain and misery

  A man must  on no account  listen to the advice of a woman  be she
   ever so good  for the end of it will be death and shame  but he
   must always consult his own mind in what he has to do or not to
   do  never losing sight of the lessons of his instructors  Thus
   not only will he obtain knowledge  but his actions will be good

  Riches  beauty  knowledge  youth  and greatness often lead a man
   into error  he  therefore  who is blessed with any of them ought
   to be  at the same time  humble and generous  for then he will
   excel  otherwise  his virtues will be hidden

  As the man who advances by fair means from poverty to riches  or
   from insignificance to greatness  is rewarded in this world  so
   will he who is generous and kind hearted be rewarded hereafter
   in heaven  So will the warrior killed in battle  who is like a
   conqueror  enjoy all the delights imaginable  while a deserter is
   despised by all men  and covered with shame and disgrace  because
   he deserted his comrades in the moment of danger

  No man ought to be termed a hero but he who has already conquered
   a hundred heroes  nor should any man be termed a holy man until
   he can boast of surpassing in virtue a hundred holy men  for as
   long as a hero has not conquered a hundred heroes  or a holy man
   has not surpassed a hundred other holy men in virtue  he can
   neither be considered as a real hero or holy man

  The signs of the approaching end of this world will be all kinds
   of depravity among mankind  that is to say  the wise will turn
   foolish  the holy men will become worldly  children will abandon
   their parents  princes will lose their empires  the little will
   become great  and commit depredations  in short  every thing will
   be in confusion  and an entire revolution take place

  In the beginning every thing was at rest and quiet  During the
   first thousand years princes began to start up  and wars arose
   about a woman named  DÃ©wi DarÃºki   at this period writing was
   first introduced  One thousand five hundred years after this
   another war began  about a woman named  DÃ©wi SÃ­nta   Two thousand
   years after this a third war broke out  about a woman named  DÃ©wi
   DrupÃ¡di   and two thousand five hundred years afterwards another
   war took place  about the daughter of a holy man not named in
   history

  Every man can thus see what has been the first cause of war
   Even as the roots of trees and the course of rivers cannot run
   straight  but wind here and there  so cannot a woman be upright
   for the saying is  that a raven can sooner turn white  and the
    tanjang  plant  a water lily  grow from a rock  than a woman can
   be upright

  A perfect man should be  in firmness and ability  equal to eight
   women  and to satisfy a woman  a man must be able to please her
   in nine different manners

  A bad man is like a fire  which inflames every thing which
   approaches it  we  therefore  ought never to go near it with
   an intention to extinguish it  A good man  on the contrary  is
   like a sweet scented tree  which continues to produce flowers
   and fruit  pleasant to the taste and smell of every one  and the
   fragrance of which remains in the wood even after the tree is cut
   down and rooted out

  When a harlot begins to feel shame  then is her improvement
   approaching  but when a holy man begins to meddle with worldly
   affairs  then is he about to become a worldly man himself

  When a prince allows encroachments to be made on his territories
   it is a sign that the loss of both his court and lands is nigh at
   hand

  A man may receive instruction from his  gÃºru   instructor  until
   his twentieth year  after which he should apply himself to study
   until his thirtieth year  at which time he ought to know every
   thing necessary  as well for this world as for that to come

  The art of elocution may properly be reckoned superior to all
   others  because happiness and misery  fortune or misfortune  very
   often depend upon it  it is  therefore  necessary to use prudence
   in speech

  A man who does not eat  sÃ­ri  betel   does not shine

  Married people who have no children ought to lead a retired life
   and people without fortune should not attempt to make a shining
   appearance  they should look pale and melancholy  like unto the
   dullness and quiet of a country without a prince

  These are the qualities necessary to constitute a good
   housewife   She must be well made and well mannered  gentle
   industrious  rich  liberal  charming  of good birth  upright  and
   humble  A stingy  curious  dirty  foul mouthed  vulgar  false
   intriguing  lazy  or stupid woman  is not only entirely unfit for
   a housewife  but will never be beloved by a husband

Intimately connected with the character  moral and intellectual  of
a people  are its civil and political institutions  In a country
like Java  the frame of society is so simple  the hand of power
is so universally felt or seen  rank  wealth  and authority are
so identified  and the different classes of the community are so
referable to each other  by contrast or reciprocal influence  that it
was impossible to give any account of the state of the peasantry  or
of the tenure and distribution of the land  without introducing some
notices concerning government and revenue  As there is little division
of labour among a rude people  so there is no division of power in a
despotism  the despot is proprietor  all the rest is property

The Island of Java appears at different times to have been divided
into states of greater or smaller extent  History informs us  that it
was at one period under the sway of one principal chief  and at others
subject to two or more  In the former case  the provinces into which
it was divided were administered  as they are still  by subordinate
and delegated governors  and in the latter  many of them composed
independent sovereignties  In all these cases  the form of government
and the privileges of the people were the same  the only difference
between a state co extensive with the Island  and one limited to a few
districts  consisting in the different extent of territory or number of
subjects at command  In looking at the map  the divisions of the Island
now under European dominion  and those under the native princes  can
easily be traced  Bantam  the sultan of which surrendered his rights to
the British government for a pension of a few thousand dollars   and
ChÃ©ribon  an extensive province to the eastward of Batavia  enjoyed
till lately a nominal independence  but the only great native power
on Java  till the establishment of  YÃºg ya kerta  about sixty years
ago  was that of the  SusuhÃºnan   or as he is termed  the Emperor of
Java  and a slight sketch of his government  of the maxims by which it
is regulated  and the officers it employs  will be sufficient for my
present purpose

The sovereign is termed either  SusuhÃºnan  or Sultan  both
denominations adopted since the establishment of Mahomedanism  the
titles previously employed were  KiaÃ­ GedÃ©    PrÃ¡bu    BrowijÃ¡ya
c  as will be perceived on reference to the list of Hindu princes in
the historical details  The line of succession to the throne is from
father to son  but the rights of primogeniture are not always allowed
or observed  If there is no direct descent  the claims of collateral
branches of the reigning dynasty are settled by no law or uniform
custom  Females have sometimes held offices of power  but have never
occupied the throne since the establishment of Mahomedanism  The chiefs
of districts and the heads of villages are sometimes women  in that
case widows continued in the office of their deceased husbands

The government is in principle a pure unmixed despotism  but there
are customs of the country of which the people are very tenacious
and which the sovereign seldom invades  His subjects have no rights
of liberty of person or property  his breath can raise the humblest
individual from the dust to the highest distinction  or wither the
honours of the most exalted  There is no hereditary rank  nothing to
oppose his will  Not only honours  posts  and distinctions  depend
upon his pleasure  but all the landed property of his dominions
remains at his disposal  and may  together with its cultivators  be
parcelled out by his order among the officers of his household  the
members of his family  the ministers of his pleasures  or the useful
servants of the state  Every officer is paid by grants of land  or by a
power to receive from the peasantry a certain proportion of the produce
of certain villages or districts

When a sovereign enjoys unlimited power  he generally in eastern
countries surrenders it for ease and pleasure  and his servant  under
the name of Vizier or some other title  becomes the despot  The highest
executive officer or prime minister in the Javan government is called
RÃ¡den AdipÃ¡ti   he usually rules the country while his master is
satisfied with flattery  with pomp  and the seraglio  He is intrusted
with power so great  as even  in particular cases  to extend to the
royal family  All communications to and from the sovereign are made
through him  he receives all reports from different parts of the
country  and issues all orders  The power and importance of this office
has  however  naturally lessened of late years  since the European
government has assumed the right of nominating the person who shall
fill it  the sovereign naturally reposes less confidence in a prime
minister so nominated than in one of his own choice  and if he does
not take an active part himself in the politics of his court  he is
generally under the influence of an ambitious member of his own family
by which means the  RÃ¡den AdÃ­pati   or prime minister  though left to
conduct the details of government  is often ignorant of many of the
intrigues carried on in the place

The gradations of power and rank are as follow

After the royal family  which includes the prince or sovereign  called
SusuhÃºnan  or  Sultan   and the sons and daughters of the sovereign
called  PangÃ©rans   the heir apparent being called  PÃ¡ngÃ©ran AdipÃ¡ti
come the nobility  and at their head the  RÃ¡den AdipÃ¡ti

The nobility or privileged orders may be classed under the two general
divisions of  BopÃ¡tis   and their immediate assistants or  PÃ¡tehs
and  MÃ¡ntris  or public officers   BopÃ¡ti  is the general term given
to the governors of provinces  being the plural of  AdipÃ¡ti   This
however  is rather a title of office than of mere rank  as these
governors are sometimes  TumÃºng gungs    An gebÃ¡is   and of still
inferior rank   AdipÃ¡ti  appears to be the highest title below royalty
The dignity of this title  as well as that of others  is again raised
by prefixing the epithet  Kiai   venerable  or  Mas   golden   as
Kiai adipÃ¡ti    KiaÃ­ tumÃºng gung    Mas adipÃ¡ti    Mas tumÃºng gung
RÃ¡den tumÃºng gung  is also occasionally used  to express a rank above
an ordinary  TumÃºng gung   in the same manner as  RÃ¡den AdipÃ¡ti

These officers  when appointed to the administration of provinces  are
called Regents by the Dutch  Since the innovations of Europeans  the
distinctions above referred to have been a good deal confounded  In the
SÃºnda  districts  where the absolute sway of the native sovereign has
long ceased to be felt  and in the eastern provinces  which are subject
to Europeans  the Regent assumes the state of a petty sovereign  and
is the fountain of honour  The power and rank attached to particular
titles  especially those of inferior importance  differs in some degree
in almost every province

The sons of the Regents  or of those who may be properly termed the
nobles of the country  are usually called  RÃ¡dens   and in the  SÃºnda
districts invariably so  but there is properly no hereditary nobility
no hereditary titles  although few people have a greater respect for
family descent than the Javans  custom and consideration  in this as in
other cases  generally supplying the place of law

Nearly the same form of government is followed in the administration of
each particular province as is observed in the general administration
of the country  every  AdipÃ¡ti   or governor of a province  having a
PÃ¡teh   or assistant  who acts as his minister  In general there is a
PÃ¡teh luar   and a  PÃ¡teh dalam   one for conducting affairs abroad or
public business  the other for the superintendence of the household

The same union of the judicial  revenual  and executive authority
which exists in the sovereign  descends to the governor of a province
and if there are subdivisions of the province  it descends to each
head of the subdivision  This is also the case with each village
the consequence of which is  that every chief  of whatever rank  has
an almost absolute power over those below him  The only exception
to this  and the only part of the Javan constitution which wears the
appearance of liberty  is the mode of appointing the heads of villages
these are elected by the people  as will be hereafter more particularly
described

In every considerable province or district there are several
subdivisions over which an inferior chief presides  the district of
SemÃ¡rang   for instance  has several  Although this absolute authority
is vested in the different chiefs  according to their ranks  it is
dangerous for a public functionary  whatever be his rank  and even for
the  SusuhÃºnan  himself  to violate what is called the custom of the
country  and the ancient Hindu institutions are revered and generally
followed by all classes  The priests also exercise a considerable
influence  and although the power of the  JÃ¡ksa   or law officer  is
essentially reduced since the establishment of Mahomedanism  and a
great part of his authority transferred to the  PanghÃºlu  or Mahomedan
priest  he is still efficient  as far as concerns the police and minor
transactions  The observations which follow on the administration
of justice and the judicial instructions established by the British
government  will explain the present nature of his duties

In the suite of every governor of a province  of his  PÃ¡teh   or
assistant  and of every public functionary of importance  are numerous
petty chiefs  generally classed as  Mantris   but having various
titles  as  DemÃ¡ngs    LÃºras    KlÃ­wons    c  varying in authority and
relative rank in different districts

Three fourths of the island having been long subjected to the
European authority  and the provinces which still remain under native
administration having been divided under two distinct authorities
and their original constitution otherwise departed from  it would be
impossible to lay down a scale of rank for the different titles of
honour  which should be applicable to every part of the island  but the
subject will be resumed in a future chapter

The following observations of Mr  Hogendorp  who resided on Java
not many years before the arrival of the English  and was employed
in a commission of inquiry into the state of the island  are
extracted from a report or memoir which he drew up for the use of the
Dutch government  recommending a policy similar to that which we
subsequently pursued  They contain a just account of the principles of
the Javan government  and of the state of the Regents under the Dutch
Company  After remarking  in perhaps too broad and unqualified terms
that the structure of the government is feudal  he proceeds to state

The first principles of the feudal system  which form the basis of the
whole edifice  are  that the land is the property of the sovereign
that the inhabitants are his slaves  and can therefore possess no
property  all that they have and all that they can obtain belonging to
the sovereign  who allows them to keep it no longer than he chooses
and that the will of the prince is the supreme law

These are the real fundamental principles of the feudal system  for
though the English and French kings could not always maintain their
despotic sway  but were sometimes opposed  hostilely attacked  and
even forced by arms to treat for terms with their subjects  this was
only the natural consequence of the acknowledged rule  that  tyranny
destroys itself   and it is only necessary to revert to what James and
Charles of England  in so late a period  thought their divine rights
of royalty  to ascertain what were the rudiments of the feudal form
of government  and even now  notwithstanding the numerous changes
and revolutions which have happened in England  the most surprizing
traces of that system are to be found  since in that country  so free
no individual soever possesses a foot of land in absolute property
allodium   but merely from the king  feodum   to whom only belongs
the  dÃ³minum absolutum et directum   although subsequent laws and
regulations have rendered this title more imaginary than real

The same system of government has been continued in the Company s
districts  under the pretext of allowing the natives to retain their
own laws and customs  but in reality from ignorance and self interest
Although they were too ignorant to effect any improvement  they knew
perfectly well that this plan was the best adapted to promote their own
interest and advantage

The princes of Java  as well as those of Europe in former times  and
as a natural effect of the same cause  were also almost continually
at war with their chief vassals  until the Dutch power and influence
re established and maintained the general tranquillity  This  however
has never had any effect on the system of government itself  and the
subject who dethroned his sovereign and then succeeded him  thought
that he had thereby obtained the same  divine right  of property in the
lands and persons of his subjects  as his predecessor had possessed

The princes allotted the lands to their chiefs and immediate
dependents  as rewards for military and other services  These chiefs
termed by the Dutch regents  again subdivided the lands among others
of inferior rank  on the same conditions  and so on  down to the poor
labourer who cultivated the land  but to whom a very small proportion
of the fruits of his labour was left for his own support

The exclusive administration of the country was conferred on the
regents  an appellation given to the native chiefs  who had acquired
their lands from the Dutch  by contract or agreement  binding them
annually to deliver partly for payment and partly not  a quantity  in
some cases fixed  in others uncertain  of the produce of such lands
obliging them also to the performance of feudal services  both of a
military and other nature

The titles of these regents are either  AdipÃ¡ti    TumÃºng gung   or
Ang ebÃ¡i   The Prince of  MadÃºra   styled  PanambÃ¡han   and the Prince
of  SÃºmenap   who is called  PangÃ©ran   are however only regents as
well as the rest  The Prince of  MadÃºra  enjoys that tide as being of
the imperial family  and the Prince of  SÃºmenap  purchased his by a
large payment to a Governor General

These regents are only officers of government  and possess not the
smallest right to hereditary possession or succession  Yet when one of
them dies  he is in general replaced by one of his sons  considered
most fit for the office  provided he can afford to pay the customary
present to the governor of the north east coast of Java  for if he is
unable to do this  or if any other person offers a more considerable
sum  a pretence is easily found to exclude the children in favour of
the more liberal purchaser

These presents form a principal part of the emoluments of the governor
of the north east coast  and consequently all new appointments of
regents are for his advantage  The present chief regent of  SamÃ¡rang
paid 50 000 dollars for his promotion  and all the children of his
predecessor were superseded  The others pay in proportion to the value
of their regencies  and as this is arbitrary and uncertain  it is
easily to be conceived  that they find means to recover the amount of
their place money 77

These Regents although very proud  are  with very few exceptions
ignorant and idle persons  who give themselves little concern about
their lands and their people  of whom  indeed  they frequently know
nothing  but only endeavour to squeeze and extort from them as much as
possible  both for their own subsistence and pleasure  and to satisfy
the cupidity of government and of their immediate superiors  They leave
the administration of affairs entirely to their  PÃ¡tehs   who are also
appointed by the Dutch  and are held accountable for every thing 78

To their brothers  wives  children  and other near relations  they
assign villages or  dÃ©sas   sufficient for their maintenance  for
all these consider themselves born not to work  and look upon the
peasantry as only made for the purpose of providing for their support

In order to collect the rice and other kinds of produce  which they
are by contract obliged to deliver to the Company as contingents  they
compel the inhabitants of the district to furnish as much of it as is
at all possible  without any fixed ratio or calculation  and without
any kind of payment  leaving them scarcely what is absolutely necessary
for their own support and that of their families  and even sometimes
not nearly so much  especially in the event of failure in the crops
on which occasions the miserable inhabitants desert by hundreds to
other districts  where  at least in the first instance  they may expect
a less rigorous treatment  Several regents also  when distressed for
money  are compelled by want  to let out many of their best  dÃ©sas
to the Chinese  these bloodsuckers then extort from such villages as
much as they can possibly contrive  while the inhabitants of the other
dÃ©sas  are alone obliged to deliver the contingent required from the
whole aggregate  It may easily be conceived  how oppressively this
demand must fall upon those unhappy individuals  and how greatly these
and other acts of injustice  which are the natural consequences of the
present faulty administration  must tend to the ruin of the country  it
would be superfluous reasoning to prove

The only restraint upon the will of the head of the government is the
custom of the country  and the regard which he has for his character
among his subjects  To shew what that character ought to be  what is
expected of a good prince  and what are the reciprocal duties of a
prince  prime minister  and people  I may here quote a few sentences
out of the  NÃ­ti PrÃ¡ja   a work in very high esteem  and constantly
referred to by the Javans

A good prince must protect his subjects against all unjust
persecutions and oppressions  and should be the light of his subjects
even as the sun is the light of the world  His goodness must flow clear
and full  like the mountain stream  which in its course towards the sea
enriches and fertilizes the land as it descends  He must consider that
as the withered foliage of the trees awaiteth the coming of rain to
flourish anew  so are his subjects waiting for his benevolence  to be
provided with food  with raiment  and with beautiful women  If  on the
contrary  a prince neglects to extend his benevolence and protection
towards his subjects  he exposes himself to be abandoned by them  or at
any rate to lose their confidence  for it is an undeniable truth  that
no one will be faithful or attached to a man upon whom no dependence
can be placed

When a prince gives audience to the public his conduct must be
dignified  He must sit upright and not in a bending posture  and say
little  neither looking on one side or the other  because  in this
case  the people would not have a proper sight of him  He must assume a
pleasing appearance  which will enable him to observe his subjects who
surround him  and then enquire if any one has any thing to say to him
and if there is  he must animate him to speak openly

In his discourse he must not speak loud  but low  and with dignity
and not more than is necessary for the purpose  for it does not become
a prince to withdraw his words if once given  and much less to give
them another turn

It is  above all  the duty of a prince to take notice of every thing
going on in his country and among his subjects  and  if possible
to turn every thing to a good end  if he passes over unnoticed the
least crime  he may create numerous enemies  It is further the duty
of a prince  besides knowing the merits of his subjects and the state
of his country  to explain all abstract and difficult expressions
particularly such as occur in writings

It is a disgrace to a prime minister for any hostile attack to be
made on the country intrusted to his charge without his knowledge  or
that he should be careless or inattentive to the same  rather thinking
how to obtain the favour of his prince than to secure the safety of
the country  So it is when he does not understand how to administer
the country properly  or fails to invent what is useful  when he makes
many promises  but fulfils few  when he is careless with regard to
public affairs  and talks much about what is of no consequence  seeking
to be admired by the people  and putting on fair appearances when
his intentions do not correspond  when he cares nothing about the
misfortunes of his inferiors  provided he gets money himself  when
finally  he is not faithful  but deceitful  Such a prime minister is
like the hawk  which soars high in the air  but descends low on the
earth to seize and steal its food

But a good prime minister is he who is upright in his heart  moderate
in his fear of the prince  faithfully obedient to all his orders
kind hearted  not oppressive to the people  and always exerting himself
to the utmost for the happiness of the people and the welfare of the
country

And a prime minister is good beyond measure who can always please
his prince in every thing that is good  who knows every thing that is
going on in the country  and takes proper measures accordingly  who
always exerts himself to avert whatever is likely to be injurious  who
considers nothing too trifling to merit his attention  who accumulates
not wealth  but offers to his prince whatever comes in his way that
is curious  who heeds not his own life in effecting what is right
who considers neither friends  family  nor enemies  but does justice
alike to all  who cares not when he is praised or reviled  but trusts
to the dispensations of Providence  who possesses much experience
who can bear poverty  and cares not for the enjoyment of pleasures
who is polite to every one  who with good will gives alms to the poor
and helpless  who consults much with his brother officers  with whom
he ought always to advise on affairs of business  Against such a
prime minister it is impossible for any one to speak  for he will be
feared at the same time that the people will become attached to him
the people will then live quiet and happy  perform their labours with
cheerfulness  and wish that his administration may be lasting

A prime minister ought  nevertheless  not to be too confident in this
but always remain on his guard against the designs of bad men

There are many examples of such prime ministers  among which is  RÃ¡ja
JÃ¡jahan    prime minister of  Mesir  Egypt   to whom all the people of
the country  great and small  were much attached

Whenever his brother officers intended to visit the prince for the
purpose of paying their respects  they always assembled at the prime
minister s house  where they generally partook of a meal  after this
they proceeded to the court  followed by the prime minister on foot
dressed in white  with only three attendants  carrying a spear and
other articles of state before him  By this conduct he supposed that he
was screened from reproach  and that he was freed from enemies  but at
the very time there were enemies conspiring against his life  as was
afterwards discovered  therefore ought a prime minister not only to be
virtuous  but cautious also  and always armed against his enemies  in
the same manner as a sportsman arms himself against wild beasts

A subject going into the presence of his prince must be clean and
well dressed  wearing proper  chelÃ¡na   pantaloons   He must have a
good girdle and a sharp  krÃ­s   and be anointed with aromatic oils  He
must range himself with his equals  and convince them of his abilities
and good breeding  because from this it is that he has to expect favour
or disgrace  grief or joy  happiness or misery  for a prince can either
exalt or humble him

A prince is like a  dÃ¡lang  wÃ¡yang  player   his subjects like
wÃ¡yangs   and the law is as the wick of the lamp used in these
entertainments  for a prince can do with his subjects what he pleases
in the same manner as the  dÃ¡lang  acts with his  wÃ¡yangs   according
to his own fancy  the prince having the law  and the  dÃ¡lang  the lamp
to prevent them from going out of the right way

In like manner  as it is incumbent on the  dÃ¡lang  to make magnanimity
and justice the principal subjects of his representation  in order that
the spectators may be instructed and animated thereby  so should a
prince  a prime minister  and chief officers of the court  direct the
administration of the country with such propriety  that the people may
attach themselves to them  they must see that the guilty are punished
that the innocent be not persecuted  and that all persons falsely
accused be immediately released  and remunerated for the sufferings
they may have endured

The judicial and executive powers are generally exercised by the same
individual  The written law of the island  according to which justice
is administered and the courts are regulated  is that of the  Koran
as modified by custom and usage  The Javans have now been converted to
the Mahomedan religion about three centuries and a half  dating from
the destruction of the Hindu kingdom of  MajapÃ¡hit   in the year 1400
of the Javan Ã¦ra  Of all the nations who have adopted that creed  they
are among the most recent converts  and it may be safely added  that
few others are so little acquainted with its doctrines  and partake so
little of its zeal and intolerance  The consequence is  that although
the Mahomedan law be in some instances followed  and it be considered
a point of honour to profess an adherence to it  it has not entirely
superseded the ancient superstitions and local customs of the country

The courts of justice are of two descriptions  those of the  PanghÃºlu
or high priest  and those of the  JÃ¡ksa   In the former the Mahomedan
law is more strictly followed  in the latter it is blended with the
customs and usages of the country  The former take cognisance of
capital offences  of suits of divorce  of contracts and inheritance
they are also  in some respects  courts of appeal from the authority
of the  JÃ¡ksa   The latter take cognisance of thefts  robberies
and all inferior offences  its officers are employed in taking down
depositions  examining evidence  inspecting the general police of
the country  and in some measure acting as public prosecutors  these
last functions are implied in the title of the office itself   jÃ¡ksa
meaning to guard or watch 79

At the seat of government are supreme courts of the  PanghÃºlu
and  JÃ¡ksa   to these there is an appeal from similar but inferior
tribunals  established within each province  Petty tribunals  under
like names  are even established under the jurisdiction of a  DemÃ¡ng
or chief of a subdivision  and sometimes of a  BÃ¡kol   or head of a
village  but in these the authority of the  PanghÃºlu  and  JÃ¡ksa
extend no further than to take down evidence to be transmitted to some
higher authority  to settle petty disputes  and perform the ordinary
ceremonies of religion  inseparable among the Javans  as well as all
other Mahomedans  from the administration of justice

Such however is the nature of the native government  that these
officers are considered rather as the law assessors or council of
the immediate superior officer of the executive government  than as
independent ministers of justice  In such cases as come before them
they examine the evidence  and point out the law and custom to the
executive officer  who is himself generally too ignorant and indolent
to undertake it  When the evidence is gone through  and the point of
law ascertained  the whole is brought before him  at whose discretion
it rests to pass judgment  It is however admitted  that in matters of
little moment  where his passions and interests are not concerned  the
division is frequently left to the law officers  but in all matters of
importance he will not fail to exercise his privileges of interference

The court of justice in which the  PanghÃºlu  or high priest presides
is always held in the  serÃ¡mbi   or portico of the mosque  a practice
which  as it inspires the people with a considerable share of awe
appears judicious  It is also convenient for the administration of
oaths  which among the Javans are always administered within the
mosque  and usually with much solemnity  The forms of the court are
regular  orderly  and tedious  all evidence is taken down in writing
and apparently with much accuracy

The court  at least at the seat of government  consists of the
PanghÃºlu   the officiating priest of the mosque  and four individuals
also of the religious order  called  PÃ¡teh nagÃ¡ri   meaning literally
the pillars or supports of the country  to whom  after the examination
of evidence in capital offences  the point of law and decision is
referred  At the seat of government the sovereign or his minister
passes judgment

The court of the  JÃ¡ksa  at the seat of government consists of the head
JÃ¡ksa   who may be styled the law officer of the prime minister  and
the  JÃ¡ksas  of his  KlÃ­wons  or assistants  for they too have their
law councils  The functions of this court being of less importance
of a more mixed nature  and less solemn because less connected with
religion  are still more subject than that of the  PanghÃºlu  to the
rude interference of the executive authority 80

The Javan code of law is divided into two departments  that of
the Mahomedan law and that of custom and tradition  The former is
distinguished by the appellation of  hÃºcum Ã¡llah   the  commands of
God   from the Arabic  the latter by the Javan words  yÃºdha nagÃ¡ra
meaning consideration for the country  or in other words  allowance for
the state of society

The decisions in Mahomedan law are chiefly guided by several works in
the Arabic language  In all the courts of Java these works are said to
be consulted in the Arabic language  but reference is more frequently
made to a collection of opinions extracted from them  and translated
into the language of the country

The law of custom is chiefly handed down by oral tradition  but has in
part been committed to writing in the following performances

The earliest work relating to jurisprudence which is now referred to
is that of  JÃºgul MÃºda PÃ¡teh   or minister of  Sri Ma PÃºng gung   of
MÃ©ndang KamÃºlan    now  WirosÃ¡ri   it is computed to be about six
hundred years old  The second bears the name of  RÃ¡ja KÃ¡pa   said
to have been the son of  JÃºgul MÃºda   and like him minister of his
sovereign  KandiÃ¡wan   also prince of  MÃ©ndang KamÃºlan

By the authority of the Sultan of  DemÃ¡k   the first Mahomedan prince
a compilation of the Javan laws was made  in which they were in some
measure blended with the Mahomedan jurisprudence  Probably this was
intended to pave the way to an entire introduction of Mahomedan law
The body of regulations   c  compressed in these codes is curious
from the laborious refinement of their distinctions  from the mixture
of moral maxims and illustrations with positive law  from the most
incongruous combinations  and from their casuistical spirit  In the
Appendix will be found the translation of a modern version of the
SÃºria Alem   a work of this description in high repute  as well an
abstract of the laws and regulations said to have been in force in the
earliest periods to which Java tradition refers 81

The proclamations   Ãºndang Ãºndang    and the laws and regulations
 Ã¡nger Ã¡ngeran   of the sovereign  form another source of deviation
from the Mahomedan law  Collections of these have been committed to
writing

The prince  by himself or his officers  is always supposed vested
with a discretionary power of adapting the Mahomedan law to the
circumstances of society  a prerogative liberally exercised  This
power  which sanctions every deviation from the letter of Musselman
law  the Javans also express by the term of  yÃºdha nagÃ¡ra   The krising
of criminals instead of beheading them  the combat of criminals with
tigers  the severe penalties for infractions of the sumptuary laws
of the Javans  the constant commutation of corporeal punishment for
a pecuniary fine  and in the case of persons of rank found guilty of
murder  the commutation of the strict law of retaliation for a fine
without regard to the wishes of the relations of the deceased  if the
latter be of no consideration  were among the deviations from the
Mahomedan law sanctioned by the  YÃºdha nagÃ¡ra

Such was the composition of the courts  and the code of laws that
existed on Java before the arrival of the Dutch  and remained unchanged
at the conquest of the island by the British  The Dutch legislated for
the colonists  but took little interest in the system by which the
judicial proceedings of their native subjects were guided  excepting in
so far as their own advantage or security was concerned in them  The
following statement contains the changes introduced by the Dutch

Besides the colonial laws and regulations  enacted from time to time by
the Governors and Council at Batavia  besides some standing orders of
the Court of Directors  and some rules and provisions contained in the
successive charters of the Company  and in what was called the  article
brief   the Dutch law  which was always considered the foundation of
the colonial law  was of authority  as far as it remained unaffected by
these institutions

A collection of the colonial statutes and regulations  called the
Placart  Book of Batavia  and an abstract of them  entitled the
Statutes  of  Batavia   were made under the authority of the colonial
government  but as the latter never underwent a regular promulgation
the rules contained in it were not considered as possessing the force
of law  except in so far as they might be found to be conformable to
the orders  proclamations  and regulations of the Indian government  or
of the Directors of the East India Company

The power of the Directors and of the Council of Batavia to enact
local laws and regulations  seems not to have been very circumspectly
defined in the first charters of the Company  those charters conferring
on them  in general terms only  authority to provide for the
administration of justice and establishment of police

But from the nature of the occasion it seems evident  that this power
of making colonial laws  as far at least as related to the Council
of Batavia  could only have been a limited one  to be exercised with
considerable discretion  and only upon points requiring an immediate
provision  subject always to the approbation of the authorities at
home  and even the Directors could hardly be considered to have
possessed a greater extent of legislative power  than was necessary
for the security of their new territories  and of their rights and
privileges  or to have been authorised to deviate wantonly from the
established law of the country  or neglect the dictates of justice and
equity

In the great variety of matter comprehended in the colonial statutes
no subject seems to have occupied more attention than the laws
respecting slavery  These  as already observed  appear to have been
formed in general upon principles of humanity and consideration for the
condition of the unfortunate beings to whom they related

In consequence of a resolution of the year 1760  the Council of India
ordered that the customs of the Mahomedans  in matters of inheritance
and successions  ab intestat    c  should be sanctioned and published

In civil matters  natives and Chinese in the districts of Batavia seem
to have been governed by the same laws as the European inhabitants

Crimes committed by natives or Chinese in the city of Batavia and its
environs  had  from the first settlement of the Dutch on the island
always been tried by European judges  and according to European law

In Bantam the criminal jurisdiction over the natives was left to the
Sultan  and that over the Chinese resident there  was exercised as at
Batavia according to the European law

The  Jakatra  and  PriÃ¡ng en  Regencies seem formerly to have enjoyed a
peculiar and fortunate state of tranquillity  Almost entirely removed
from every communication and intercourse with Europeans  Chinese  and
other foreign settlers found in the neighbourhood of Batavia  engaged
in agriculture  and ruled by their own native chiefs  these districts
seem to have been in a high degree free from crime  but whenever
enormities did happen  the offenders were sent down to Batavia  and
tried according to European law  It is to be observed  however  that on
the first submission of those districts to the Company  their chiefs or
regents reserved to themselves the jurisdiction over the inhabitants of
their respective districts  but this stipulation appears to have been
disregarded in the latter times of the Dutch Company  and under the
late administration of Marshal Daendals  a court was established for
these districts  the rule of which was European law

From ChÃ©ribon the Chinese were amenable  as from Bantam and Batavia
but the natives were subject to a  landraad   or local court   of which
the Resident was president  and the Sultans members  and this court
was  partly at least  directed by a  papÃ¡kam   or native code  compiled
under the sanction of the government

In the Eastern districts of the island  the Javans seem always  in
criminal matters  to have enjoyed their own laws  founded on ancient
custom and the precepts of the  Koran   Of these laws the Council of
Batavia caused abstracts to be printed  for the guidance of the great
landraad  or high court at  SemÃ¡rang   to which all the Javans in the
European provinces  from  LosÃ¡ri  to  BanyuwÃ¡ngi  were amenable

Under the native government  the prime minister   RÃ¡den AdipÃ¡ti   is
the head of the police  as well as every other department of authority
The higher class of functionaries is most frequently to be found in
those parts of the country most remote from the seat of government
where  as governors of provinces  they possess some extension of
powers  The great and fertile provinces near the capital  on the other
hand  are divided into small appropriations  of from two hundred to
one thousand  chÃ¡chas   or families  placed under the administration
of division officers  whose authority is limited to the duties of
police

Each village is possessed of a distinct organization within itself
has its chief  its  KabÃ¡yan  or assistant  and if of any considerable
size  its priest  whose advice is frequently had recourse to  and who
generally decides petty disputes  especially respecting divorces and
matters of inheritance  The chief of the village is not without his
share of judicial authority  and often takes upon himself to punish by
fine and imprisonment  In each village the inhabitants keep regular
nightly watches and patrols

The manner in which these little societies have been recently formed
in the districts to the east of  SurabÃ¡yu   where the European
authority had not interfered  and where the influence of the Mahomedan
government was scarcely felt  will tend to illustrate their nature and
constitution

The frequent wars  in which the people had been engaged with the
inhabitants of  BÃ¡li  and  MadÃºra   as well as with the Dutch  had
reduced those provinces to a state of wilderness towards the middle
of the last century  The encouragement held out to the people of the
neighbouring island of  MadÃºra  brought over several adventurers  who
were allowed to occupy the land they cleared  first rent free  and
afterwards at a fixed assessment  If several persons came together
their leader was invested with the authority of  PetÃ­ng gi  over the
new village which they formed  When individuals associated to construct
a village  the chief was elected by themselves  subject to the approval
of the landlord  and they possessed the privilege  common in all the
districts east of  SurabÃ¡ya   of annually electing their chief  or
PetÃ­ng gi

The nature of the duties rendered by this person was so essential to
the well being of a village  that this privilege was most intimately
connected with its existence  Whenever a new assessment was imposed
on the lands  it was the business of the  PetÃ­ng gi   if the amount
was too high  to represent the matter to the superior  and to state
the inability of the people to make good the demand  the consequence
was  either a reduction of assessment on the part of the principal  or
desertion on that of the people  But when the amount of the assessment
was considered reasonable  and any amount less than three fifths seems
to have been so considered   the  PetÃ­ng gi  had to assemble all the
people  and to distribute to each  in the common presence of all  his
individual proportion of land  with a statement of the produce to be
paid  He had to keep a roster of all duties required of the people  and
to see that every man took his proper turn  When the harvest ripened
he had to watch the collectors  that they exacted no more from each man
than his proportion  and the cultivator  that he did not embezzle any
part of the due of government  In large villages he had an assistant
called a  KabÃ¡yan   who represented him during his absence  and with
the  KamitÃºah  and  MÃºdin   priest   formed a court for settling petty
village disputes  subject  however  to a reference  if the parties
should be dissatisfied

It was customary for the people of the village to cultivate the lands
of their  PetÃ­ng gi  without payment  This and the honour of chiefship
rendered the office an object of village ambition  while an annual
election  and the fear  if turned out  of being called upon to justify
his conduct  rendered this officer generally a steady and careful
representative of his constituents

All strangers passing through the country were expected to apply to
the  PetÃ­ng gi  for the assistance they required  and if payment was
tendered  all procurable necessaries were furnished  The  PetÃ­ng gi
also took charge of the strangers  property  examined the same in the
presence of the other head man  and was bound to return the whole
undiminished the next morning  or to pay the value  If  however  the
stranger preferred keeping his property under his own charge  and
rested himself for the night under some of the public sheds  the loss
he might sustain fell on himself alone  and all he could procure from
the village was assistance to trace the offenders

It was customary  as well to deter beasts of prey as thieves  for a
part of the men of each village to keep a night watch round it  and to
perform this duty in successive rotation

Such appears to have been the internal regulation of these villages
and it seems to have been framed according to the ancient usage of the
island  the similarity of which to that of Western India has been
adduced as a strong instance of one common origin 82

It follows from the above  that each village has in itself the
materials of a good police  and that a right of choosing their
chiefs gives to the people a considerable share of real liberty 83
This right of election in the inhabitants of the village  as before
observed  would appear at one time to have been general throughout the
island  It is still respected in the districts of  SurabÃ¡ya   where the
office of  PetÃ­ng gi  was always elective  for although the same person
might hold it for many years  a ballot for the situation was regularly
held at specified periods  varying from one to three years 84

The right of election is also clearly acknowledged in the districts
of  JapÃ¡ra  and  JawÃ¡na    That the  PetÃ­ng gi  is elected by the
inhabitants of a village   observes the officer who introduced the
settlement into those districts 85    there cannot be a doubt  and even
the right of election is foregone by the people  though I have not met
with a single instance of the kind  it may be taken for granted  that
it is so only  in consequence of the influence of the Regent  to serve
some particular purpose  While the  PetÃ­ng gi  continues in office  he
is looked up to and obeyed by the people of the village to which he
belongs as the immediate chief  He generally occupies the  pasÃ©ban
usually to be found in villages of consequence  and has two or more
men  inhabitants of the village  appointed to attend him wherever he
goes  A  PetÃ­ng gi  was usually elected for one year  during which
time he could not  according to the ancient usage  be removed  except
in consequence of some gross misconduct  but if his conduct was such
as to give satisfaction to the inhabitants  they continued him for
several years  As far as I could learn   continues the same officer
the Regent  or other superior native authority  seldom interfered in
the election of a  PetÃ­ng gi   but it was generally understood  that
although he could not force a  PetÃ­ng gi  upon them who was disliked
by the people  his confirmation was required before the person elected
could act with effect

In the  SÃºnda  districts of  ChÃ©ribon  and  TegÃ¡l   the appointment
to this office is invariably made  if not by the election of the
villagers  generally from among themselves  and always with their
concurrence  It is a common practice for the people of a village  even
where the right of election is not in use  to represent in a body the
conduct of their chief  if incorrect  and it has always been necessary
for the chief native authority to remove him  if the complaints were
justly founded

A reference to the judicial regulations in the Appendix 86  will show
how desirous the British government on the island has been to protect
the privileges of these societies  and in particular the right of
electing their chief

When the British authority was established on the island  it
was immediately seen that something must be done to supply the
deficiencies  and to correct the imperfections of the native code  All
the other changes in contemplation for the encouragement of industry
and for the abolition of oppressive and impolitic exactions  would have
been nugatory  without such an improvement in the judicial and police
regulations  as would secure  by a full and impartial administration
of justice  the rights and privileges about to be conferred  It would
have been in vain to define the limits of power  to issue directions
for guiding the conduct of public servants in their transactions
with the people  or to have abrogated the oppressive privileges
of the chiefs  and to have assured the people of the intention of
government to protect them against all invasion of their rights
either by open violence  by the exaction of services  or by oppressive
contributions  without establishing effective means of obtaining
redress when aggrieved  The system acted upon was at once barbarous
and revolting  Practices prevailed under the sanction of native law
which were abhorrent to the criminal jurisdiction of any enlightened
nation  without being at all necessary to the due administration of
justice 87   I allude particularly to torture and mutilation  These the
Earl of Minto immediately abolished  by his proclamation of the 11th
September 1811  in which  besides this beneficial and humane enactment
he laid down clearly and distinctly the liberal and enlightened
principles which should guide the local government in the subsequent
revision of the civil and criminal code of the colony  The result was
the enactment of the code of judicial and police regulations which
will be found in the Appendix to this work 88   The outlines of these
regulations  and the principles which dictated them  are contained in
a Minute which I recorded on the 11th February 1814  when they were
completed and promulgated  and the following quotations from that
document may be sufficient to put the reader in possession of the
change which was effected

It was essential  in conducting the revenue arrangements  that the
measures taken for the establishment of a good and efficient police
and the full and impartial administration of justice throughout the
island  should preserve an equal pace

Rights were not to be bestowed and defined  without a suitable
provision for their being effectually guarded against any invasion  and
it became an object of the first moment  to form such an adequate and
consistent code of regulations  as should serve  in every instance
to guide the executive officers of government in the performance of
their duty  and to make known  and secure to the people  the means of
obtaining redress  whenever they felt themselves in any way aggrieved

The system found existing on our first arrival was at once complicated
and confused  In the principal towns there were established courts
but these were constituted in all the troublesome formalities of the
Roman law  and in the different residencies were provincial courts
styled  land raads   where the native form and law was left to take its
course  with all its barbarities and tortures

The Dutch government  proceeding entirely on the system of
commercial monopoly  paid very inferior attention to their internal
administration  They had little other connexion with their best
subjects  the cultivators of the soil  than in calling on them
from time to time  for arbitrary and oppressive contributions and
services  and for the rest  gave them up to be vassals to the various
intermediate authorities  the Regents   DemÃ¡ngs   and other native
officers  These either at first purchased their situations  or
stipulated for a certain tribute  in service or money  in consideration
of which all the inferior classes of inhabitants were made over  to
be dealt with by them as most pleasing to themselves  Policy  and the
common attention to their own good  suggested to these a certain equity
of procedure  and it was generally the custom to leave each village
to its own management  with respect to police and settling the petty
quarrels that occurred within its limits  but for the continuance of
what was good in such a system  there was no security whatsoever  and
oppression and injustice must have constantly occurred  Where the will
of the lord was the paramount law  his vassals could only have depended
on his natural goodness of disposition for being equitably treated  No
remedy was afforded where the reverse was the case  and they possessed
in short  no security  no freedom whatsoever

On the propriety of the measures to be adopted by us to remedy such
evils  no doubt could exist

The first proclamation of the enlightened founder of the present
government adverted immediately to this subject  As a step that could
not  consistently with British ideas  admit of a moment s delay  it
instantly ordained  that torture and mutilation should no longer make
part of any sentence to be pronounced against criminals  and it then
proceeded to define clearly the relative situation of the English
and Dutch inhabitants  laying down rules for the future guidance of
government concerning them  This proclamation  dated 11th September
1811  has long been before the world  and it would be superfluous
in this place  to dwell on that love of justice and benevolence of
disposition  which is to be traced through every part of it  It forms
the basis of the present respective European rights in this colony 89

As a continuation of the measures so ably sketched out by my
predecessor  I issued the proclamation  dated the 21st January  1812

In this I attempted to simplify the clumsy and unwieldy structure of
the former courts  by abolishing some  lessening the number of the
judges in the remaining ones  and by defining  as accurately as I
could  the limits of their respective jurisdictions

It was found that  formerly  there were separate courts for
investigating the conduct of the immediate European servants of the
Dutch Company  and of Europeans not included in that service  This
distinction  as Lord Minto observed  never could have been grounded
on any sound principle  and it being resolved  that justice  under
the British government  should be administered equal and alike to
all classes and denominations  the judicial power of the College of
Schepenen was abolished  and transferred to the jurisdiction of the
courts of justice

The great number of judges who  under the Dutch administration  formed
a court  was reduced in each to a president and three members

One court was established in each of the three principal towns
Batavia  SemÃ¡rang  and SurabÃ¡ya  the jurisdiction of which extended
over its European inhabitants  proceeding  in civil cases  in the mode
before established  but in criminal ones  so as to conform as much as
possible to that established in Great Britain  in all cases confronting
the prisoner with the evidence  and a jury being called to judge of the
fact on the evidence so adduced

To relieve these courts from numerous inconsiderable causes  courts
of the nature of Courts of Requests  were also established in these
three towns  for the recovery of small debts

For matters of police within the towns  magistrates were appointed
but they were ordered to confine themselves entirely to this branch

An abuse which had been discovered to be usual  the compounding crimes
and offences  in consideration of a sum of money paid to the Fiscal or
other officer  had also met with Lord Minto s most severe reprehension
as being one of an abominable nature  and to be suppressed without
delay  The practice was accordingly strictly prohibited  and
consonantly with British ideas was termed scandalous

Thus much had been done with regard to Europeans  and it has been
found fully sufficient

But with respect to the native inhabitants of the Island  it was to be
expected that much greater changes would be necessary

In the first instance  it was ordered that courts should be
established in the different districts  in which the chief civil
authorities should preside  aided by the Regents and other native
officers  for the purpose of hearing and trying all causes in which
natives only were concerned  the amount of their civil decisions  when
exceeding fifty dollars  being submitted for confirmation to the courts
of justice  and all criminal cases  of a capital nature  being made
over by them to judges of circuit  who were ordered to be sent on this
duty twice a year  from among the members of the superior courts

Thus much was known not to militate either against the principles
of universal and natural justice  or against the particular laws and
usages of the country  and thus much was only  at first  done  because
it was resolved to obtain the fullest knowledge of the subject  with
regard to the manners  habits  and institutions of our native subjects
before we established one general code of regulations for the internal
administration of the country

In effecting this grand object  it was rather my wish to have it
maturely and well done  than by accelerating it too much  to run the
risk of taking up a crude system  which would require to be afterwards
re considered  and perhaps entirely new modelled

On the principle  however  which would eventually guide me  there was
no doubt  nor is it necessary for me to dilate on the impolicy  the
inconvenience  or the injustice  of subjecting the natives of Java to
any other laws  than those of their ancient government and established
faith

The tranquillity of the country and the duties of police have been
provided for  by preserving the original constitution of the villages
and continuing the superintendence and responsibility in the hands
of those  whose rank enables them to exert a due influence  and to
command respect  For the administration of justice  the duties of the
Resident  as judge and magistrate  have been considerably extended  In
civil cases  the mode of proceeding  and the establishment of petty
courts  are founded on the practice of the country  in criminal  the
jurisdiction and authority of the Resident has been considerably
extended  Hitherto  his duties had been strictly confined to police
but considerable delay and injury to the parties accused  as well
as to the witnesses  had been occasioned by allowing all causes of
a higher nature to lie over for the Court of Circuit  and as the
separation of the collection of the Revenue would afford more time
to the Resident  it was resolved to extend the criminal jurisdiction
of the Provincial Courts to all cases  in which the punishment for
the crime alleged does not amount to death  In these courts  which
instead of being termed  Landraad   as heretofore  are now styled the
Resident s Courts   the  PanghÃºlu   or chief priest  and the superior
JÃ¡ksa   or native fiscal  attend to expound the law  The  BopÃ¡tis
or Regents  with their  PÃ¡tehs   are present  to aid and assist the
Resident with their opinion in the course of the investigation  but
they have no vote in the decision  If the opinion of the law officers
appears to the Resident to be according to substantial justice  and is
in accordance with his own opinion  the sentence is immediately carried
into effect  provided the punishment does not extend to transportation
or imprisonment for life

In cases where the punishment adjudged is more considerable  or
wherein the opinion of the law officers may be at variance with that
of the Resident  a reference is to be made to the Lieutenant Governor
and in all cases where the punishment for the crimes charged is of a
capital nature  the prisoner is committed to jail  to take his trial
before the Circuit Judge

On the first establishment of the Courts of Circuit  it was
directed that the President and one other member of the Courts of
Justice  should proceed once in six months  or as much oftener as
circumstances might require  to the different Residencies in their
several jurisdictions  for the trial of offenders  Much inconvenience
however  was found to arise from the absence of those members of the
courts from the towns in which they were established  as it necessarily
followed  that all civil business was at a stand while they were away
On the other hand  to prevent delay on the trial of criminals  it was
necessary that they should visit the Residencies more frequently than
once in six months

To remedy this in future  and to provide for the prompt and due
administration of justice among the native inhabitants  in a manner
that is not repugnant to their notions of right and wrong  one member
of each of the courts of justice has been appointed a Judge of Circuit
who will be present in each of the Residencies at least once in
every three months  and as much oftener as necessary  In the mode
of proceeding  they are to avoid the formalities of the Roman law  A
native jury  consisting of an intelligent foreman and four others 90
decide upon the fact  the law is then taken down  as expounded by the
native law officers  and the sentence  with the opinion of the Judge
of Circuit  and on the application of the Dutch and Colonial law on
the cases  is forwarded for the modification or confirmation of the
Lieutenant Governor

Hitherto the jury required by the Court of Circuit  did not exceed
five in number  and these  as justly observed   were chosen from a
class of men  Europeans  who had no common feelings  no common rights
who were  in no shape or consideration  the equals of the person tried
The law was the law of Europe  The jury  under their best prejudices
were influenced by that law  and its meanings and penalties were
applied to people who reason in a different manner  and who often never
knew any thing of the laws of Europe  before they found themselves its
convicted victims

The general jurisdiction of the Courts of Justice at Batavia
SemÃ¡rang  and SurabÃ¡ya  is now confined to Europeans and foreigners and
to the inhabitants of those towns and their suburbs  and a line has
been drawn  which distinctly separates the police of the country from
that of the towns

Collections of the different law books and institutions of the
country are now making  and a native establishment has been formed
at Buitenzorg  under my immediate superintendence  for examining and
revising the judicial proceedings  and for affording to the native
inhabitants that facility of appeal  which the remoteness of the
Government  and the rules of Dutch administration  did not formerly
admit of  but which is so consonant to the principles on which the new
system of internal economy has been established

Under the native government  the whole of the male population capable
of bearing arms was liable to military service  but the number of
people required to cultivate the land  and to perform other public
services  did not admit of more than one third being spared for
military purposes  except in cases of extraordinary emergency  The
extent of the force permanently kept up by the sovereign in time
of peace varied  of course  with the probability of approaching
hostilities  when this was smallest  the number seldom exceeded what
was required for the state and pomp of the court  and might have
amounted to four or five thousand men  Until within the last sixty
years  when the Dutch first obtained a supremacy over the whole
island  the provinces under the native administration had for several
centuries been in a continual state of warfare  but since that period
the military spirit has been gradually subsiding  and  by the existing
treaties with the native princes  they are restricted in the number of
troops which they may maintain  Those of the  SusuhÃºnan  are limited
to a body guard of one thousand men  such further number as may be
required for the tranquillity of the country  the European government
undertakes to furnish

Before the native sovereign was under this restriction  he used to
raise the requisite force by a demand upon the governor of each
province for a specified number  to be furnished at a certain time
varying according to circumstances  The governor or chief of the
province apportioned this demand among the subdivisions  and the
village chiefs selected from among the villagers as many as were
required of them  and thus  in a country where every man wears a  kris
or dagger  and the spear or pike is the principal military weapon  an
army  or rather a numerous armed mob  was easily collected in a few
days  The men furnished from the villages  and of whom the mass of
every large army necessarily consisted  were distinguished from the
soldiers by profession   prajÃºrit    by the term  Ã¡rahan   or  prajÃºrit
Ã¡rahan   During their absence from home  they were provisioned by the
sovereign  and their wives and families were maintained by the head of
the village  who required of the remaining cultivators to assist in
working their fields or gardens

The sovereign  as the head of the military and the fountain of military
honour  assumes among his titles that of  SenapÃ¡ti   or lord of war
When an army is to be raised  he appoints a certain number of his
chiefs to be  widÃ¡nas   or commanders of corps of three hundred and
twenty men  Under each  widÃ¡na  are four  lÃºrahs  or  tÃ­ndihs   who
command companies of eighty men  and have each two subaltern officers
called  babÃ¡kals  or  sesÃ¡bats   each having the command of forty men
The  widÃ¡nas  were remunerated for their services by grants of land
to the amount of a thousand  chÃ¡chas   from which they had again to
make assignments for the maintenance of the inferior officers  who were
always nominated by them

When troops march through the country  or supplies are required  a
demand is made upon the neighbouring districts  which are obliged
to contribute according to their means  without payment  When in
an enemy s country  the troops  of course  subsist by plunder  the
disbursement of money for provisions or supplies being unknown

The native armies of Java consisted chiefly of infantry  but the
officers were invariably mounted  and when cavalry was required  each
province furnished its quota  the troops  whether on foot or mounted
joined the army properly equipped for action  It was thus unnecessary
for the sovereign to keep up a store of arms  Each village has its
provision of spears  and sometimes of fire arms  the officer of
subdivision keeps a further reserve for contingencies  and as the chief
of the province is responsible for the proper equipment of the men  he
generally has also a further store to supply any deficiency

Of the different weapons used in Java  the most important and the most
peculiar to the Eastern Islands is the  krÃ­s   which is now worn by all
classes  and as an article of dress has already been noticed

The Javan  krÃ­s  differs from the Malayan  in being much more plain
as well in the blade as in the handle and sheath  it differs also in
the handle and sheath from the  krÃ­s  of  MadÃºra  and  BÃ¡li   as may
be seen in the plate  The varieties of the blade are said to exceed
an hundred  and as a knowledge of the  krÃ­s  is considered highly
important by the Javans  I have  in a separate plate  offered specimens
of the most common

In the plates are also exhibited the different kind of spears
darts  and other weapons  either said to have been in use formerly
or actually used at the present day  These are the bow and arrow
 gendewa    pana   which are seldom used in modern days  except on
state occasions  The arrows  termed  chÃ¡kra    paspÃ¡ti    trisÃºla
warÃ¡yang    diwÃ¡l    rÃ³da dedÃ¡li   and others of a similar form  as
well as the clubs called  indÃ¡n    gÃ¡da   and  dÃ©nda   are represented
as the weapons used by the gods  demigods  and heroes of antiquity
and are constantly referred to in the mythological and historical
romances of the Javans  and exhibited in their scenic and dramatic
entertainments  The  tÃºlup  and  pÃ¡ser  represent the tube and the
small arrows which are rendered poisonous by the  Ãºpas   these have not
been used on Java for centuries  but they are common in less civilized
islands of the Archipelago  and particularly on Borneo  The  gÃ¡njing
is an iron bar  formerly used by the Javans  The  bandrÃ­ny   or sling
is still used with considerable effect  and was employed in resisting
the British troops in 1812  The  pedÃ¡ng    bandÃ³l    badÃ­k    golÃ³k
mentÃ³k    lÃ¡mang  or  klewÃ¡ng   and  chundrÃ­k   are varieties of the
sword  The  kÃºdÃ­ trÃ¡nchang  is a weapon which was formerly general on
Java  but not now much used  The  wedÃºng  is a peculiar weapon  in
the shape of a chopper  worn on occasions of state by all chiefs when
in presence of the sovereign  Of spears and darts  there are several
varieties distinguished by different names  Small round shields are
still in use  the long shield is not  The matchlock exhibited in the
plate is a representation of a piece manufactured on  BÃ¡li

Besides these instruments of war  the Javans have long been acquainted
with the use of cannon  muskets  and pistols  Previous to the reduction
of  YÃºgya kÃ©rta   in 1812  by the British forces  the Sultan cast
brass guns of considerable calibre  and at  GrÃ©sik  they are still
manufactured for exportation  Round the  krÃ¡ton  of  SÃºra kÃ©rta  are
mounted several very large pieces of artillery  and great veneration is
paid to some of them supposed to have been the first introduced on the
island  two  in particular  are considered to be part of the regalia
For muskets and pistols they are principally indebted to Europeans
Gunpowder they manufacture  but to no considerable extent  and the
quality is not esteemed

From an army raised only on emergency  and composed of people who do
not make the military life a profession  much discipline cannot be
expected  The veneration  however  which the common people pay to their
chiefs  the well defined gradations of rank  and the devotion with
which all classes are willing to sacrifice themselves in support of
their ancient institutions and independence  seem to render the Javan
troops  while acting under their own chiefs  orderly and tractable  In
their tactics and conduct they endeavour to emulate the examples given
in their ancient romances  and in the plans for their pitched battles
the march of their armies  and the individual heroism of their chiefs
they strive to imitate the romantic exhibitions contained in the poems
of antiquity  In the great  MatÃ¡rem  war  for instance  the result of
which was the establishment of the present family on the throne  the
disposition of the army is said to have been in the form of a shrimp or
prawn  as represented in the plate  This form is termed  mangkÃ¡ra   or
the shrimp which hides its soul  alluding to the sovereign who is in
the centre and not to be approached  The plan of this order of battle
is said to have been taken from the poem of the  BrÃ¡ta YÃºdha   and was
adopted by  BimÃ¡nyu   the son of  ArjÃºna   The  dirÃ¡da mÃ¡ta  is another
form  said to have been used by the army of  AstÃ­na   and has likewise
been adopted by the modern Javans 91

Of the bravery and heroism required of a soldier  some notion has
been given in the account of the Javan ethics  and a reference to
their history  for the last three centuries  will abundantly prove
that although unacquainted with those evolutions and tactics which
contribute so largely to the power of an European army  the Javans  as
soldiers  have not been deficient  either in personal courage  or in
such military principles as might be expected from the general state of
society among them  and as are well suited to the nature of the country
and the weapons they are accustomed to carry 92

It is the national boast  that it was not so much by force of arms
as by intrigue and stratagem  that the Dutch obtained the superiority
in the country  The history of the Dutch administration on Java will
abundantly testify this  and at the same time prove  that among
Asiatics  there are few nations who have fought more obstinately in
support of their independence than the Javans  It was by corrupting
and bribing the chiefs  and sowing disunion among them  that the Dutch
succeeded in dismembering an empire  already shaken  at the period of
their arrival  by the constant wars which attended the establishment
of Mahomedanism  The comparison which has been drawn by the Javans
themselves of their own character  in contrast with that of the Dutch
may serve to illustrate the nature of the military feeling still
existing in the country   The Dutch   say they   are superior to the
Javans  inasmuch as they have good heads  they can calculate  and they
understand policy better  but then they have cold hearts  the Javans
are poor simple beings  but they love their country and will never quit
it  their heart glows and often burns

The phrenzy generally known by the term  muck  or  Ã¡mok   is only
another form of that fit of desperation which bears the same name
among the military  and under the influence of which they rush upon
the enemy  or attack a battery  in the manner of a forlorn hope  The
accounts of the wars of the Javans  as well as of the  MalÃ¡yus   abound
with instances of warriors running  Ã¡mok   of combatants  giving up all
idea of preserving their own lives  rushing on the enemy  committing
indiscriminate slaughter  and never surrendering themselves alive 93
Even at present  there are to be found among the Javans men who profess
to be and are considered invulnerable  and there are some who  by a
dextrous manner of receiving the spear  and other such artifices
completely impose upon the too credulous people  Nothing is so easy
as for an artful man to persuade the common Javans that he possesses
supernatural power  At the present day this pretension  and the
artifices by which it is supported  are more generally of a religious
nature  but during the wars  every fortunate chief was considered as
partially vested with it

The general term for a soldier is  prajÃºrit   the guards of the
sovereign are distinguished by the term  tantÃ³mo    Sara g ni  is the
name given to those who carry fire arms   GÃ¡ndek  are the couriers or
messengers who convey the orders of the commanders  In every army there
is a certain number called  jÃ¡ga bÃ©la   whose duty it is to prevent the
body of the troops from deserting  and to see that every man does his
duty   PÃ¡na kÃ¡wan  is the term by which the youths who accompany their
fathers and relations to battle are distinguished   SemÃºt gÃ¡tat  is
the general term for attendants  retainers  and followers of an army
But besides distinctions of office  there are others purely of merit
and honour  those are called  niÃºtra  who are selected as superior to
their comrades in person and strength  the  prawireng  are those who
have once distinguished themselves in battle   magÃ¡tÃ­sh   those who
sacrifice all other prospects in life in order to pursue the love of
arms   trÃºna lÃ¡yang   gallant youths   jÃ¡ga sÃºra   those whose courage
is undisputed  and who keep a good look out   jÃºdi pÃ¡ti   those who
hazard their lives in battle  as they would hazard a die in any common
game of chance  literally  who play with death   nirbÃ¡ya   those
who are above a sense of pain or fear   jÃ¡yeng sekÃ¡r   flowers of
victory 94   This latter term was chosen by Marshal Daendels for the
native militia raised for the service of the Dutch government during
his administration

In the Dutch armies the Javans were considered as inferior to the other
islanders as soldiers  and from the facilities offered for desertion
while serving on Java  it was with great difficulty that they could
be disciplined  The men were invariably raised by conscription  and
instances have occurred of their deserting by companies  Under the
British a corps of about twelve hundred men was raised  with little
prospect of advantage for the first two years  but  by the perseverance
and ability of the officer who commanded them  they afterwards became
a well disciplined corps  and on all occasions behaved themselves with
fidelity and courage when called into action  As individuals  they
are  for the most part  physically weaker than the  MalÃ¡yus  and other
islanders  and as a nation  their agricultural habits have considerably
obliterated the military character which they once possessed  Their
country  however  particularly in the interior  is naturally very
strong  full of ravines and fastnesses  and their mode of warfare is
perhaps the best adapted for its defence  Were the whole energies of
the nation united under one chief  with the experience which they now
have of European tactics  it may be assumed that they would render it
impregnable to any open attack  either of an European or an Asiatic
force  but  unfortunately for their independence  it has been their
lot  as their history will shew  to be continually disunited  either
by religious or political feuds  Their greatest resistance appears to
have been made against European influence  They maintain with pride
that although virtually conquered  they still  as a nation and as
individuals  pertinaciously adhere to their ancient institutions  and
have a national feeling  very different from that which is usually to
be found among a conquered people

The subject of revenue  for the support of the various establishments
under the native government  has been so repeatedly touched upon  and
came so much into view in the account given of Javan agriculture  that
many further details here would appear tedious and unnecessary  All
public officers  it has been often observed  from the highest chief
to the lowest menial  are remunerated by grants of land revokable at
pleasure  and all expences of the courts of justice  all police and
military services  defrayed out of the same fund  There is no public
treasury  When public works are to be executed  or supplies are to
be furnished  each village is called upon to furnish its quota of
men  of provisions   c   and on the equitable regulation of these
services and contributions depends the reputation of the native chief
The land constitutes the only treasury of the prince  and this is
valuable according to its fertility  and the extent and number of
its cultivators  There are  to be sure  certain general taxes and
imposts levied throughout the country  but these appear to have been
of comparatively modern introduction  and unconnected with the genuine
principles of the Javan government  The nature of several of these
imposts and taxes has been explained in treating of the landed tenure
and the condition of the peasantry  The following statement  extracted
from the Report of a Dutch commissioner 95   appointed to inquire into
the subject of taxation in the year 1812  though it refers to the
particular province of  SurabÃ¡ya   may be considered as applicable to
the greater part of the island  and I here produce it in preference
to any more general or more concise account of my own  because it
will shew that the opinions I have so often expressed  concerning the
oppressions of the Dutch authorities  the patient submission  the
industry  and other good qualities of the lower classes of Java  are
not peculiar to the English  but entertained by some of the subjects of
a government which profited by the abuses complained of  and must have
been anxious to conceal their enormity

The ordinary taxes annually levied in the district of  SurabÃ¡ya  are
as follow

1  The  grabÃ¡g  or  petÃ©k   or as it is sometimes called  the  chÃ¡cha
or capitation tax  is generally levied at the rate of four rupees for
each  chÃ¡cha  a year  that is to say  for such a quantity of profitable
land as may be cultivated by one family

2  The contingent or contribution of rice to government  being from
fifteen to nineteen  pÃ­kÃºls  of clean rice from each  jung   according
to its situation and fertility

3   PÃ¡ri pÃ¡najÃºng   from which  however  are excused the distant
districts   consisting generally of three  Ã¡mats  of  pÃ¡ri   equal to
from eight to ten  kÃ¡ti  of rice  from each  jung   This is destined
for the maintenance of those  MÃ¡ntris  and chiefs who were not at all
or insufficiently provided with rice fields of their own

4   PÃ¡ri pÃ¡gondÃ­kan   levied only in the districts near the capital
consisting generally of two  gÃ©dings  or double heaps of  pari   This
was destined for the extraordinary expences of the districts  as the
maintenance of the government  state prisoners  native ambassadors from
the opposite coast  and the like

5   PÃ ri pakÃ¡sak   consisted of three  gÃ©dings  from each  jung
destined for the maintenance of those who superintend the direction of
the water courses   c

6   PÃ¡ri zÃ¡kat   consisted of one  Ã¡mat  of  pÃ¡ri  from each  jung
and was destined for the maintenance of the church and chief priests

7   PÃ­trah   consisted in the payment of twenty  kÃ¡ti  of rice from
each  jung   also destined for the maintenance of the priests

8   MÃ¡lÃ¡man   This consisted of a payment made to the Regent or chiefs
of the districts  at each of the three festivals of  MÃºlut    PÃºasa
and  BesÃ¡r   of ten  kÃ¡ti  of rice  and three and a quarter stivers in
money from each  jung   one large fowl  five eggs  four cocoa nuts
one bunch of plantains  and from those who held three or four  jungs
was further required a bottle of oil  to add to the solemnity of the
ceremony  to which persons of this condition were universally invited

It is easy to conceive  that the common Javan was not able to make
any money after paying these taxes and contributions  at least not so
much as he wanted for himself and family  particularly if we take into
consideration  that it is very seldom one man is the sole proprietor
of a  jung  alone  but that it is often divided between three and four
persons  and that  with the most successful harvest  such a  jung  does
not produce more than thirty to thirty five  Ã¡mats  of  pÃ¡ri   With all
this  however  the common Javan would feel himself satisfied  if he had
no other taxes to pay  having generally a good many fruit trees  and a
little cottage farm  in which he cultivates  sÃ­ri    c  and sometimes a
small fish pond in the vicinity of his dwelling  which is usually free
of tax  But this is not the case  he must submit to other oppressions
which not being regulated  are for that reason the heavier  because
they are called for in an arbitrary way  and because self interest does
not fail to seize every possible opportunity of extortion

When a chief has occasion to travel  when a marriage  birth
circumcision  recovery from illness  or any such subject of festivity
occurs in his family  it is advertized immediately to the subordinate
towns and villages  the inhabitants of which feel themselves obliged
each in proportion to his means  to carry him fruits  rice  fowls  and
even buffaloes and money  These are called free presents  but in fact
are as much an obligatory contribution as any of the others  to say
nothing of the many demands for fowls  eggs  ducks  fruits   c  for
which payment is made  but always at a rate far below their value  or
of the numerous fines which are continually exacted from the people
in compensation  or as hush money for disputes and offences of every
description  the taking away of  bÃ¡mbus   and sometimes of fruit trees
when wood is required  either for government or the chief  to which
must yet be added  that for the execution of the duties of government
and on the conveyance of orders   MÃ¡ntris   and other subordinate
chiefs  were continually  in the neighbourhood of the villages  just
like so many voracious birds  who think themselves entitled not only
to take something for their trouble  but to be provided during their
stay with every thing gratis  even opium  if they require it  This
custom  adopted on Java  extends to every other chief  although not in
employment  and even to the Regents  their relations   c  None of these
persons will pass through a town or village  without demanding what he
wants for his maintenance or journey  and very often he asks what he
does not want  to the great oppression of the common Javan  Much is
wasted by this practice  and no particular advantage appears to result
from it

We must  indeed  be astonished to see all the oppressions   c  to
which the common Javan must submit  It is usually said  indeed  that
the Javan is not accustomed to an easy life  and ought not to have more
than barely enough to keep him alive  with many more such expressions
but this is not the manner of reasoning of any well thinking man
who  though he sees very well the imperfections and weak nature of the
Javan  yet bears in mind that he is a man like himself  who  although
he has been conquered  it is true  by the greater valour and knowledge
of the European  has still an equal right to be treated like a man

But  alas  these are not all the vexations and oppressions which
fall to the lot of the common people  who bear all without murmuring
The feudal service was as grievous as almost all the other charges
united  The origin of those services must be sought for in the feudal
system of the native government  long ago adopted throughout Java
It was considered that all the land was the property of the prince
who only made provisional assignments thereof to his subjects  in
remuneration for military and other services rendered  This was the
cause of all the lands being divided into as many allotments as could
be cultivated  called  chÃ¡chas   each of a size to be cultivated by
one man  A certain number of these was assigned to the different
chiefs  according to their rank  the custom of the country fixing not
only the amount of contributions to be paid from the produce  but
the number of men to be constantly kept in attendance upon them  The
lands thus assigned to chiefs were exempt from service to them  and
the inhabitants were only expected to watch the villages  to make and
repair the roads  and to perform other general services of the state
This was the situation of the people with regard to service  when the
coast districts were first ceded to the European government  The system
of trade and fixed contributions did not admit of any change  and the
services were at that time of very little consequence  and such as
could be performed without oppression to the inhabitants  but the case
is now quite different  Successively and particularly of late years
much heavier services have been demanded than were ever before known
and it naturally follows  that the Javan must be kept more at work
than before  Besides  it is not possible to apportion those services
equally  on account of the situation of the places where the services
are required  and because the chiefs  who have the direction of the
works  from indifference and laziness  generally make a requisition on
the nearest village  and it not unfrequently happens  that many people
are thus taken for the public service  who have no lands whatever
allotted to them

Were the requisitions made for the public service alone  it would
still be comparatively nothing  it being admitted that the state has a
right to the labour of its subjects  but the Regents  their relations
their  PÃ¡tehs   and the subordinate chiefs of every description  assume
the right of disposing of the services of the common people as they
think proper  and themselves employ many of them in menial labour of
all descriptions 96   from which it arises  that the number of people
employed away from their homes  on what is called public services  is
almost incredible

It is therefore more than time  and highly necessary  that an end be
put to this monstrous system of government  Humanity looks forward with
pleasure to this step  Government  who are essentially interested  have
the most perfect right to take it  but the change must be entire and
radical  Where the machine is entirely bad  it would be vain to attempt
the repair of a few of the parts of which it is composed  the whole
would still remain worthless  and it would only result that the main
defects being hidden by a specious covering  the whole labour would be
worse than thrown away

The British government did accordingly alter the whole system of
revenue  The subject was forced upon its attention  not only by the
desire which every humane and liberal administration must feel  to
promote the happiness of its subjects  but by considerations of a
prudential nature  The resources of the country had sunk under a
capricious and tyrannical system of exaction  industry was paralyzed
and confidence was destroyed  The opportunity for effecting a
reformation was favourable  our means ample  and we had nothing to
dread from the opposition of those interested in supporting abuses
it was  therefore  resolved to abolish all oppressive taxes  and to
come immediately upon the soil for support of our establishments
by appropriating a fixed portion of its produce  leaving the full
enjoyment of the remainder to the cultivator  with every facility for
turning his industry to account  What was done in consequence  by the
land revenue arrangements  has been seen in the account given of landed
tenure

The subjects of the colony were freed from the sway of their chiefs
who were no longer permitted to demand at pleasure their services or
their property  These chiefs were compensated for the loss of their
former influence by salaries in money or allotments of land  which they
either held on condition of performing the police duties  or collecting
the revenue  When paid by the rent of land  they were permitted to
exact no more than the assessment settled by government  No arbitrary
power was allowed them to disturb the peasant in the enjoyment of the
remainder  or to drag him from his home and his duties to his family
for the purpose of swelling their idle pomp  or performing services
about their person or household  The Chinese farmers of the revenue in
ChÃ©ribon  and other districts  having oppressed the people by every
rapacious and tyrannical expedient  were  by the discontinuance of
the farms  deprived of the power they had exercised over the persons
and property of the natives  Forced services and all deliveries of
produce at inadequate rates on government account were abolished  and
for whatever colonial produce or supplies might be required for the
public service  the fair market price was ordered to be paid  Duties
on the transport of goods from one part of the country to another  and
on the sale of commodities at markets or bazars  were  for the most
part  abolished  as injurious to trade and discouraging to agricultural
industry  The system of farming the import and export duties  which
existed under the Dutch  was likewise annulled  and collectors were
appointed to receive the duties immediately for government  Internal
duties  of the nature of tolls and market dues  had been universally
though secretly  levied by the Chinese  in  ChÃ©ribon  and other places
in direct opposition to the orders of government and the terms of their
engagement  This abuse  engrafted on the farming system  incalculably
aggravated its evils and called loudly for redress  The farmer thrust
his rapacious hand into every place where there was the least prospect
of gain  and limited his demand only by the capacity of the merchant
to satisfy it  or by an ill defined custom  which might be perverted
almost at pleasure  so as to accommodate itself to any exaction  The
evils resulting from this mode of raising a revenue may easily be
calculated  when it is stated  that  for a very trifling contribution
to government by the farmer  duties were levied upon internal transport
amounting to nearly fifty per cent  on the value of the commodities
transported  Rice  on its transport from one part of the island to
another  had been liable to duties of about forty six per cent
Regulations were made for fixing the amount of import duties  and
equalizing them over the island

The restoration of the Dutch Indian empire to the sovereign of the
Netherlands  at a period when these important changes were only in
progress  may have perhaps prevented the full accomplishment by the
English of the details in some districts  but the principles of the
new system were not only introduced and thoroughly understood in all
the more populous districts under the European government  but an
experience of three years fully demonstrated the advantages resulting
from it to the public revenue  It would have been attended with
great immediate loss  without any corresponding future gain  to have
abolished at once all the former sources of revenue  but the thorough
change of system was declared  and the principles of it were acted
upon  as far as was consistent with the security of public tranquillity
and the realization of the current resources of the country  and the
results of these arrangements  as far as they went  proved that a
land rent might  even with the existing taxes in the capitals   c
be realized at the rate of at least six rupees annually from each
cultivator  or after the abolition of the taxes bearing on agriculture
at the average rate of four Spanish dollars from each cultivator
giving in the one case a rental for the whole island of about six
millions of rupees  and in the other of four millions of Spanish
dollars  or at five shillings the dollar  a million sterling  Of this
one fourth would accrue to the native princes  and the remainder to the
European government  The particulars of the land revenue settlement
effected in each district  and the detailed resources of the different
parts of the island  will be particularly noticed in the statistical
accounts which will appear in a subsequent part of this volume  when
the subject of revenue will be again adverted to  and  in the mean
time  it may be sufficient  for the purpose of shewing the general
resources  to refer to the annexed table  exhibiting the revenues and
expenses of the Javan government for a period of three favourable years
under the old Dutch Company  for three years under the administration
of Marshal Daendels  when its real resources were first called forth
and the revenue was higher than before known  and for the first three
years under the British government  of which alone  the accounts are
yet closed  The dependencies included in this table do not include
the Moluccas or Spice Islands  the administration of which under the
British government was kept distinct from that of Java

By this statement it will appear  that the revenues actually realized
in cash  on Java  in the year 1814 15  and before the land revenue
arrangements had become fully effectual  amounted to upwards of six
millions and a half of rupees  to this may be added one third more
for the revenue of the native provinces  making a total revenue of
the island exceeding eight millions and a half of rupees  or above a
million sterling

From a colony which was able to furnish at such a moment so extensive
a revenue from its own internal resources  after the drains  checks
and restrictions to which it had been subjected during the last two
centuries  what might not have been expected  had confidence been
once established in the permanency of the government  and the tide of
British capital been once fairly turned into it

FOOTNOTES

74  The inhabitants of these Islands are strikingly alive to a
sense of shame  a feeling  which is heightened by the influence of a
tradition among the MalÃ¡yus  that  on the first establishment of the
Malayan nation  the islanders stipulated  that neither they nor their
descendants should ever be put to shame  The tradition runs as follows

Then  Ampu  and  Maling  made obeisance to  Sangsapurba   a prince
who had arrived in Sumatra from Western India  and who is supposed to
have founded the Malayan empire  and represented to him that  Demang
Lebar Daon   chieftain broad leaf of Palembang   had a daughter
Sangsapurba  accordingly sent to ask her in marriage  but he excused
himself  alleging  that she would probably be struck with sickness  and
that he would only resign her to him as a wife on certain conditions
These conditions were  that  on  Sangsapurba  marrying his daughter
all the family of  Demang Lebar Daon  should submit themselves to
him  but that  Sangsapurba  should engage  both for himself and
his posterity  that they should receive a liberal treatment  and
in particular  that when they committed a fault  they should never
be exposed to shame nor opprobrious language  but if their fault
was great  that they should be put to death according to the law
Sangsapurba  agreed to these conditions  but he requested  in his
turn  that the descendants of  Demang Lebar Daon  should never move any
treasonable practices against his descendants  even though they should
become tyrannical   Very well   said  Demang Lebar Daon    but if your
descendants break your agreements  probably mine will do the same
These conditions were mutually agreed to  and the parties swore to
perform them  imprecating the divine vengeance to turn their authority
upside down who should infringe these agreement  From this condition
it is  that none of the Malayan rajas ever expose their Malayan
subjects to disgrace or shame  they never bind them  nor hang them
nor give them opprobrious language  and whenever a raja exposes his
subjects to disgrace  it is the certain token of the destruction of his
country  Hence also it is  that none of the Malayan race ever engage in
rebellion  or turn their faces from their own rajahs  even though their
conduct be bad  and their proceedings tyrannical     MalÃ yan Annals

77  This payment is regularly termed by the Dutch   ampt geld   or
place money  being money paid for the purchase of an office  By the
Javans it is termed  sorok   which  in its more general acceptation
means a bribe

78  With whatever fidelity this character of the Javan regents may
have been drawn by Mr  Hogendorp  in the year 1800  it most certainly
did not apply to them in the year 1811  nor in the subsequent years
of the British government on Java  for  however negligent and corrupt
many of them may have been rendered  by the system of government
which prevailed under the Dutch East India Company  the changes
effected during the administration of Marshal Daendals soon induced
a character for energy and activity  His government was military and
despotic in the extreme  and the regents were considered to hold a
military rank  and required to exert themselves in proportion to its
importance  They did so  and works of the greatest magnitude were
constructed by their exertions  The chiefs were found active and
intelligent  the common people willing and obedient  With regard to
their character under the British Government  it would be an act of
injustice  if not ingratitude  were I to neglect this opportunity of
stating  that  as public officers  the Regents of Java were almost
universally distinguished by an anxiety to act in conformity with the
wishes of the government  by honesty  correctness  and good faith  and
as noblemen  by gentlemanly manners  good breeding  cheerfulness  and
hospitality  In the observations made upon the Javan character in the
text  I have spoken of the Javans as a nation generally  but I might
select instances where the character of the individual would rise
very far above the general standard which I have assumed  I might
for instance  notice the intellectual endowments and moral character
of the present  PanambÃ¡han  of  SÃºmenup  NÃ¡ta KasÃºma   This chief is
well read  not only in the ancient history of his own country  but
has a general knowledge of Arabic literature  is conversant with the
Arabic treatises on astronomy  and is well acquainted with geography
He is curious in mechanics  attentive to the powers of mechanism  and
possesses a fund of knowledge which has surprised and delighted all who
have had an opportunity of conversing with him and of appreciating his
talents  Of his moral character I have given an instance  in the manner
in which he liberated his slaves  He is revered  not only for his
superior qualifications and talents  but also for the consideration and
attention he pays to the happiness and comfort of the people committed
to his charge

Of the capacity of the Javans to improve  of their anxiety to advance
in civilization  and of the rapidity with which they receive knowledge
and instruction  an instance might be given in the case of the two
sons of the Regent of  SemÃ¡rang  KiÃ¡i AdipÃ¡ti SÃºra AdimangÃ¡la   This
Regent  who  next to the  PanambÃ¡han  of  SÃºmenap   is the first in
rank as well as character  shortly after the establishment of the
British government on Java  sent his sons to Bengal  in order that
they might there receive an education superior to what they could
have had at home  They remained there for about two years under the
immediate protection and patronage of the late Earl of Minto  and on
their return not only conversed and wrote in the English language with
facility and correctness  but evinced considerable proficiency in every
branch of knowledge to which their attention has been directed  The
eldest  in particular  had made such progress in mathematics before he
quitted Calcutta  as to obtain a prize at a public examination  and
had acquired a general knowledge of the ancient and modern history of
Europe  particularly in that of Greece and Rome  He is remarked for his
graceful and polite manners  for the propriety of his conduct  and for
the quickness and correctness of his observation and judgment  As this
is the first instance that has been afforded of the capacity of the
Javan character to improve under an European education  it may enable
the reader to form some estimate of what that character was formerly in
more propitious times  and of what it may attain to hereafter under a
more beneficent government  Among all the English on Java  who have had
an opportunity of conversing with this young nobleman  there has not
been one who has hesitated to admit  that his mind  his qualifications
and conduct  would be conspicuous among their own countrymen at the
same age  and that  as an accomplished gentleman  he was fitted for the
first societies of Europe  This young man   RÃ¡den SÃ¡leh   is now about
sixteen years of age  and when the British left Java was an assistant
to his father as Regent of  SemÃ¡rang

79  The following description of the office of a  JÃ¡ksa   and of the
qualifications requisite for fulfilling his important duties  is taken
from the  Niti PrÃ¡ja   a work already referred to

A  JÃ¡ksa  must  in all cases  be impartial  to enable him to weigh all
causes which come before him with the same exactness as merchandize is
weighed in a scale  and nicely balance the equilibrium  nothing adding
or taking from either side

He must be above all bribery  either by words or money  and never
allow himself to be induced to commit an act of injustice  for were a
JÃ¡ksa  to commit an act of this kind  the consequences could not but
be highly injurious to the country

He must not accept presents of any kind from the parties whose cause
comes before him  not only because he cannot expect to derive advantage
therefrom  but also because the public will hold discourse concerning
him highly injurious to his reputation

All causes in dispute must be decided upon by him with the least
possible delay  according to law  and not kept long in suspense  to the
injury of the parties concerned  lest he be considered like a holy man
who  for the sake of money  sacrifices his good name

A  JÃ¡ksa  must inquire into every circumstance relating to the causes
brought before him  and duly investigate the evidence  after which he
must take the cause into consideration  He must not  in the least
listen to what is false  and on all occasions must decide according to
truth

A  JÃ¡ksa  who attends to all these points is of high repute  Of less
repute is a  JÃ¡ksa  who  in the decision of causes which come before
him  listens to the advice of others  such a one is like that kind of
bird  which in order to procure for itself the necessary food  dives
under water  without thinking of the danger to which it is exposed of
losing its life from the want of air  But entirely unfit for employment
is a  JÃ¡ksa  who is haughty in his demeanour  and at the same time low
enough to take advantage of persons who come before him  such a one
is like a bat  that in the dark steals the fruit from the trees  or
like a sportsman  who though destined to chase what is useful only
indiscriminately destroys whatever comes in his way  whether useful or
not  In the same manner is it with a priest who every day attends at
the temple  for no other purpose but to make profit by it  or with a
writer  who knows not how to make any thing but by the prostitution of
his writings  or with the head man of a village  who imposes upon the
villagers  or a devotee  who gains his livelihood by necromancy

80  The following was the usual course of proceeding in  JÃ¡para   and
generally in the provinces subjected to European authority  previous to
the interference of the British government  The plaintiff went to the
JÃ¡ksa  and made his complaint  If the case was important  the  JÃ¡ksa
took down the deposition in writing in the presence of witnesses
summoned the accused  and communicated the deposition to him  The
latter then either acknowledged or denied the facts  witnesses were
examined  and the proceedings of the suit laid before the Regent  who
after perusal transmitted the same to the  PanghÃºlu  for his advice
with which the latter complied  referring at the same time for a
sentence to some of the collections on Mahomedan law  The Regent having
compared the sentence with the law and with equity  and finding the
same correspondent with both  judgment was pronounced by the  JÃ¡ksa

81  See Appendix C

82  With the exception  perhaps  of the right of election  which
I have not seen noticed in any account of Continental India  the
constitution of the Javan village has a striking resemblance to that of
the Hindus  according to the following statement in the Fifth Report
of the House of Commons on Indian Affairs   A village  geographically
considered  is a tract of country comprising some hundreds or thousands
of acres of arable and waste lands  politically viewed  it resembles
a corporation or township  Its proper establishment of officers and
servants consists of the following descriptions  the  Potail  or head
inhabitant  who has generally the superintendance of the affairs of
the village  settles the disputes of the inhabitants  attends to the
police  and performs the duty of collecting the revenues within his
village  a duty which his personal influence and minute acquaintance
with the situation and concerns of the people render him the best
qualified to discharge  The  Kurnum   who keeps the accounts of
cultivation  and registers every thing connected with it  The  Tallier
and  Totie   the duty of the former appearing to consist in a wider and
more enlarged sphere of action  in gaining information of crimes and
offences  and in escorting and protecting persons travelling from one
village to another  the province of the latter appearing to be more
immediately confined to the village  consisting among other duties
in guarding the crops and assisting in measuring them  The boundary
man  who preserves the limits of the village  or gives evidence
respecting them in cases of dispute  The superintendent of  tanks
and water courses  distributes the water therefrom for the purposes
of agriculture  The  Bramin   who performs the village worship  The
schoolmaster  who is seen teaching the children in a village to read
and write in the sand  The calendar  Bramin  or astrologer   c

These officers and servants generally constitute the establishment of
a village  but in some parts of the country it is of less extent  some
of the duties and functions above described being united in the same
person  in others it exceeds the number of individuals which have been
described

Under this simple form of municipal government  the inhabitants of the
country have lived from time immemorial  The boundaries of the villages
have been but seldom altered  and though the villages themselves have
been sometimes injured  and even desolated by war  famine  and disease
the same name  the same limits  the same interests  and even the same
families  have continued for ages  The inhabitants give themselves
no trouble about the breaking up and division of kingdoms  while the
village remains entire  they care not to what power it is transferred
or to what sovereign it devolves  its internal economy remains
unchanged  The  Potail  is still the head inhabitant  and still acts as
the petty judge and magistrate  and collector or renter of the village

In examining the interior of a village on Java  we find that  in common
with the Hindu usage  it possesses a constitution within itself
independent of the supreme governing power  Here  as in Western India
it will be found that each village possesses its  PetÃ­ng gi  or chief
its  Kabayan   who is the deputy or assistant to the head of the
village  its  Kamituah  or elders  generally men who have formerly been
chiefs of the village  its  MÃºdin  or priest  its  Ulu ulu  or  Kapala
Bandang an   or superintendent of water courses  its  Jeru tulis  or
writer   c

87  Among many others  the following enactments  which were in force
in some of the Eastern districts when the English arrived  will serve
to shew the barbarities of the law then existing  in its operation on
the people  and its leniency towards the great

Any person murdering his superior shall be beheaded  his body
quartered and given to the wild beasts  and his head stuck upon a
bambu

Any person disobeying his superior and attempting to murder him  may
be killed by the superior  without giving any intimation thereof to the
chief town

Any person daring to destroy any public advertisement promulgated by
government shall forfeit his right hand

A  DemÃ¡ng   or other chief of a  dÃ©sa   being acquainted with
any conspiracy tending to the injury of the state  and not giving
intimation thereof  shall be punished by losing one ear  his head shall
be shaved  and he shall be banished

Any person daring to offer violence to a priest in the mosque or among
the tombs shall forfeit one hand

If a woman kills a man she shall be fined 500 reals  batÃº

If a superior kills an inferior he shall be fined 1000 doits

If a person puts out the eyes of another he shall be fined 500 reals
batÃº   if one eye only 50 reals

There were also different fines for maiming different parts of the
body   For cutting out the tongue  500 reals  for knocking out the
teeth  25  for breaking the thumb  500  for breaking the finger  100
and the like    See Collection of Native Laws at Banyuwangi

90  The number required to compose the jury was fixed in conformity
with the ancient usages of the country  in which five persons are
considered necessary to assist in the deliberation upon any matter of
importance

91  In joining the battle it is usual for the warriors to shout  and
for the trumpets   sarenen    gongs  and drums used in the martial
music of the country to be sounded

92  The following verse from the  NÃ­ti SÃ¡stra KÃ¡wi  may be adduced  in
further illustration of the notions entertained by the Javans regarding
the bravery of a soldier

The brave man who has been successful in war obtains his heart s
desire

The brave man who dies in war is received into heaven and cherished by
the  Widadaris

If a man is cowardly in war and die  the keepers of hell seize upon
him in a rage

Should he not die  he is reprobated and despised by all good men  even
to his face

93  It is on these occasions that the parties frequently increase
their desperation by the use of opium

94   As to their military character  it is certain   says Plutarch
they were able commanders  both by sea and land  But as the champions
who in one day gain the garland  not only in wrestling  but in the
pancration   are not simply called victors  but by the custom of
the games  the  flowers of victory   so Cymon  having crowned Greece
with two victories gained in one day  the one at land  the other at
sea  deserves some preference in the list of generals     Langhorne s
Plutarch  Cimon and Lucullus compared

CHAPTER VII

  Ceremonies of the Court  Deference paid to superior
   Rank  Regalia  Processions  Pomp  Rank and
   Titles  Ambassadors  Ceremonies attending Births  Marriages
   and Funerals  Account of the People called KÃ¡lang
   and of the Inhabitants of the TÃ©ng ger Mountains  The
   Bedui  Festivals  Amusements  The Drama  WÃ¡yangs  The
   Dance  Tournaments  The Chase  Tiger Fights  Combat of Criminals
   with Tigers  Bull Fights   c   Games of Skill and Chance  Other
   Customs and Usages


Having  in the preceding Chapter  endeavoured to pourtray the natural
and moral character of the people of Java  and to convey to the reader
a general idea of the nature and principles of the government to which
they have been subjected  I shall now proceed to detail some of the
usages and customs which prevail among them

Of these the ceremonies of the court are the most obvious  and a
stranger cannot fail to be struck with the extreme deference and
respect towards their superiors  by which the Javans are characterized
Respect for rank  for experience  for parents and old age  have been
already noticed among the features of their character  but the excess
to which deference to rank is carried by the political institutions of
the country  deserves more particular remark  whether we consider it as
illustrative of the nature of the government and the quiet and orderly
disposition of the people  or endeavour to trace  in the early periods
of their history  the causes which may have contributed to the existing
constitution of society among them

The respect shewn to superior rank on Java is such  that no individual
whatever his condition  can stand in the presence of a superior
neither can he address him in the same language in which he is spoken
to  Not even the heir apparent  or the members of the royal family
can stand in the presence of the sovereign  and the same restriction
applies to the family of each subordinate chief  Were this mark of
respect confined to the royal family alone  it might perhaps find a
parallel in other eastern countries  where it is usual for the subject
to prostrate himself before the sovereign  but in Java the nature of
the government is such  that each delegated authority exacts the same
marks of obeisance  so that  from the common labourer upward  no one
dares to stand in the presence of a superior  Thus when a native chief
moves abroad  it is usual for all the people of inferior rank among
whom he passes  to lower their bodies to the ground till they actually
sit on their heels  and to remain in this posture until he is gone by
The same rule is observed within doors  and instead of an assembly
rising on the entrance of a great man  as in Europe  it sinks to the
ground  and remains so during his presence

This humiliating posture is called  dÃ³dok   and may be rendered into
English by the term  squatting   The practice is submitted to with
the utmost cheerfulness by the people  it is considered an ancient
custom  and respected accordingly  It was  however  in a great measure
discontinued in the European provinces during the administration of the
British government  who endeavoured to raise the lower orders  as much
as was prudent  from the state of degradation to which their chiefs
aided by the Dutch authority  had subjected them  but it continued in
force in the native provinces  in  MadÃºra   and to a certain extent
in most of the districts at a distance from the seats of European
government

In travelling myself through some of the native provinces  and
particularly in  MadÃºra   where the forms of the native government
are particularly observed  I have often seen some hundreds drop on
my approach  the cultivator quitting his plough  and the porter his
load  on the sight of the  TÃºan besÃ¡r s  carriage  At the court of
SÃºra kÃ©rta   I recollect that once  when holding a private conference
with the  SusÃºnan  at the residency  it became necessary for the  RÃ¡den
adipÃ¡ti  to be dispatched to the palace for the royal seat  the poor
old man was as usual squatting  and as the  SusÃºnan  happened to be
seated with his face towards the door  it was full ten minutes before
his minister  after repeated ineffectual attempts  could obtain an
opportunity of rising sufficiently to reach the latch without being
seen by his royal master  The mission on which he was dispatched was
urgent  and the  SusÃºnan  himself inconvenienced by the delay  but
these inconveniences were insignificant  compared with the indecorum
of being seen out of the  dÃ³dok  posture  When it is necessary for an
inferior to move  he must still retain that position  and walk with his
hams upon his heels until he is out of his superior s sight

Besides this deference in the posture of the body  a deference  equally
striking and still more defined  is shewn in the language used to a
superior  The vernacular language of the country is never allowed to be
used on such occasions  but only an arbitrary language  distinguished
by the term  bÃ¡sa   the language  or  bÃ¡sa krÃ¡ma   the polite language
or language of honour  The common people are thus not permitted to
use the same language as the great  or in other words  are by the
political institutions of the country  in a great degree  deprived
of the use of their mother tongue  This subject will however be more
particularly treated of in another chapter  That a set of people who
have received some mental culture will necessarily discover it in their
language  and that a line of distinction will be thus drawn between
the well informed and the ignorant  is natural  and of the employment
of a different number of persons in the verbs and pronouns  according
as supremacy  respect  or familiarity is to be expressed  the modern
European languages afford abundant example  but that one class of words
should be exacted from the lower orders as a homage to the powerful
and another class given in exchange  serving to remind them of their
inferiority  is a refinement in arbitrary power  which it would be
difficult to parallel

Having thus seen the nature and extent of the general deference paid
to a superior on Java  the reader will be prepared  in some degree
for the still further humiliations which are expected from a subject
on public occasions  No one approaches his sovereign or immediate
chief  no child approaches his father  without  sÃºmbah    to that is
obeisance  closing his hands and raising them to his forehead  in token
of respect  On public or festival days  it is usual for the inferior
chiefs  not as in Europe  to kiss the hand  but to kiss the knee  the
instep  or the sole of the foot  according to the relative distance of
rank between the parties

The royal seat is a large stool or bench of gold or silver with a
velvet cushion  it is called  dÃ¡mpar   and attends the sovereign
wherever he may go

Among the regalia   upachÃ¡ra    which are always carried in procession
when the sovereign moves abroad  and are arranged behind him while
seated on the  dÃ¡mpar   are the following golden figures   the  hÃ¡sti
or  gÃ¡ja   that of an elephant  the  hÃ¡rda walÃ­ka  or  nanÃ¡gan   that
of a serpent  the  jajÃ¡wen sÃ¡nting   that of a bull  the  sÃ¡ngsam
that of a deer  and the  sÃ¡wung gÃ¡ling   that of a cock fowl  each of
a size to be borne in the hand  These  with the  kÃºtuk  and  chapÃºri
for tobacco and  sÃ­ri   the  pakachohÃ¡n  or golden spitting pot  and a
variety of golden salvers  bowls   c  distinguished by the respective
names applicable to their different purposes  have descended as
pusÃ¡kas   or heir looms  in the royal family  and are esteemed with
the highest degree of veneration

When the sovereign moves abroad  he is attended by numerous spearmen
 wÃ¡hos    the duty of eight of whom is to attend the figures of the
sacred elephant and bull  near which are also led four horses richly
caparisoned  The royal  pÃ¡yung   or state umbrella  is carried in front
of the procession on these occasions  in which are also invariably
carried four trunks or boxes   brÃ³koh    each borne by two men  and
containing the clothes of the sovereign  caparison for his horses
his personal arms  implements  provisions  and in short every thing
required for an establishment  this rule is observed whenever the
sovereign moves out of the palace  His mat   lÃ¡ntÃ©   is likewise
borne in procession  together with two saddle horses for his use when
necessary

The ceremonies and state of the native courts have lost much of their
genuine character  from the admission of European customs  introduced
by the Dutch after the last Javan war  Salutes are regulated after the
European order  and the Javans have availed themselves of many of the
customs of Europeans  to render the ceremonies of state more striking
Thus both the  SusÃºnan  and  SÃºltan  are furnished with large gilt
carriages  after the fashion of those used by the Lord Mayor of London
When the former drinks wine with the governor  the rest of the company
are offered white wine  while they alone drink red  and a flourish of
trumpets sounds as the glass approaches their lips

It may be observed  that few people are more attached to state and show
than the Javans  that  in general  the decorations employed and the
forms observed are chaste  and at the same time imposing  calculated to
impress a stranger with a high idea of their taste  their correctness
and yet love of splendour  The ornaments of state  or regalia  are
well wrought in gold  the royal shield is richly inlaid with precious
stones  and the royal  krÃ­s  is hung in a belt  which  with its
sheath  is one blaze of diamonds  In processions  when the European
authority is to be received  each side of the road  for miles  is lined
with spearmen in different dresses  and standing in various warlike
attitudes  streamers flying  and the music of the  gÃ¡melÃ¡n  striking up
on every side   PÃ¡yungs   or umbrellas of three tiers  of silk richly
fringed and ornamented with gold  are placed at intervals  and nothing
is omitted which can add to the appearance of state and pomp  Among the
ensigns displayed on these occasions are the  Monkey  flag of  ArjÃºna
and a variety of other devices taken from the poems of antiquity  as
well as the double bladed sword  and a variety of inscriptions from the
Arabs

The chiefs of provinces  and the petty chiefs in their gradation below
them  keep up as much of the form and ceremony of the chief court as
is consistent with their relative rank and means  and  in their turn
exact from their vassals the same degree of respect which the sovereign
exacts from them

On occasions when the Regents are anxious to shew particular respect to
Europeans  as on the entrance of the Governor  or other high officer
travelling  it is the custom  particularly in the  SÃºnda  districts
to erect triumphal arches of  bÃ¡mbu  at the entrance of the principal
villages  and the taste and variety displayed on these occasions have
been often noticed  as evincing a refinement beyond what the general
results of their present state of civilization might justify

In a former place I noticed  that the gradations of rank among the
Javans were  in some instances  marked by the dress they wore  and
by the manner of putting on the  krÃ­s   but a more defined line is
drawn by the  pÃ¡yung   or umbrella  which is subject to the following
regulation from immemorial custom

1  The Sovereign alone is entitled to the golden  pÃ¡yung  97

2  The  RÃ¡tu   or Queen  and the members of the royal family  to the
yellow  pÃ¡yung

3  The family of the  RÃ¡tu   and the family of the Sovereign by his
concubines  to the white  pÃ¡yung

4  The  BopÃ¡tis  and  TumÃºng gungs  to the green  pÃ¡yung   edged and
mounted with gold

5  The  Ang ebÃ¡is    RÃ¡ng gas    MÃ¡ntris    c  to the red  pÃ¡yung

6  The heads of villages  and other petty officers  to the dark
pÃ¡yung

In order to convey an idea of the different titles and the gradations
of rank among the Javans  it becomes necessary  in consequence of the
confusion which has arisen among them of late years  to revert to what
they were supposed to be in the days of  MÃ¡japÃ¡hit  and previously
when the Hindu faith and institutions exclusively prevailed

The usual term for the sovereign was then  RÃ¡tu   and in the literary
compositions which have descended to us  he was either distinguished
by such epithets as  NÃ¡ra nÃ¡ta    NÃ¡ra dÃ­pa    NÃ¡ra pÃ¡ti    NarÃ­ndra
NarÃ¡ria    Aji    PrÃ¡bu    KÃ¡tong    Ajung   or  MÃ¡harÃ¡ja   The queen
was called  PramiswÃ¡ri   The children of the sovereign were called
the princes  RÃ¡den   and the princesses  DÃ©wi   which titles were
hereditary in their families  The brothers of the sovereign had the
title of  RÃ¡den aria

When a sovereign was advanced in age  and quitted his government to
become a devotee  he was called  BegÃ¡wan

The minister who administered the country in the name of the sovereign
and issued his orders to the governors of provinces   c  was always
termed  PÃ¡teh   and the chiefs employed in administering the government
of the provinces  or otherwise in the government of the country  were
entitled either  PratÃ­iwa    Pung gÃ¡wa    NiÃ¡ka   or  BopÃ¡ti   The
chiefs below these  and subject to their orders  such as  RÃ¡ng ga
Ange bÃ¡i    DemÃ¡ng    PramÃ©a    MÃ©nak    KlÃ­won   and others were
included in the class of  Mantris

The heads of villages were called either  Umbul    PatÃ­ng gi
BabÃ¡kal    BabÃ¡hu    LÃºra   or  KÃºwu

The commanders in chief in war had the title of  SenapÃ¡ti   The general
term for soldiers was  prajÃºrit   and those employed in guarding the
country from the approach of an enemy were called either  PechÃ¡t
tÃ¡nda    TÃ¡mping   or  Ulu bÃ¡lang

In judicial affairs the  JÃ¡ksa  was the chief  His assistant or deputy
was  PaliwÃ¡ra   and the officers of his court  KÃ©rta

WadÃ¡na gÃ©dong  was the title given to the officer entrusted with
the charge of the sovereign s purse and personal property  and with
the collection of his revenues  the secretary or writer was called
ChÃ¡rik    TÃ¡nda  and  SabÃ¡ndar  was the title of the officers who
collected the duties in the markets and along the high roads

When it was necessary for the sovereign to move from one part of
the country to another  there was always a class of  MÃ¡ntris  in
attendance  to whom the title of  Pang alasan  or  KajÃ­neman  was given

On the establishment of the Mahomedan religion  in the Javan year 1400
a new gradation of rank and order of titles was introduced by the
sultan of  DemÃ¡k   as follows

The sovereign  instead of being called  RÃ¡tu   took the name of
SusuhÃºnan  98   or  Sultan   and the queen was called  RÃ¡tu   The
title of  PanÃ¡mbahÃ¡n  was conferred as the highest in rank next to the
sovereign  and above the princes of the blood  who were now termed
Pang Ã©ran  or  Pang Ã©ran Ã¡ria   the princesses born of the queen were
termed  RÃ¡tu   and the daughters by concubines  RÃ¡den Ã¡yu   The sons of
the princes were called  RÃ¡den mas   until they were married  when they
were termed  RÃ¡den  only  their daughters before marriage were called
RÃ¡den ajÃ©ng   and after marriage  RÃ¡den Ã¡yu   The  SusuhÃºnan s  great
grandchildren by his wife were allowed to assume the title of  RÃ¡den
and those by his concubines bore the title of  Mas   the latter title
continuing to descend in the family to the offspring by a wife  those
by a concubine taking the title of  BÃ¡gus   which is considered as the
lowest title appertaining to royalty  It would be tedious  in this
place  to detail the minor titles common in the  SÃºnda  districts  they
will be more particularly noticed in the statistical accounts of those
districts

When a  BopÃ¡ti   or governor of a province  is appointed  he is
furnished with a  piÃ¡gam  or  nawÃ¡la   or letter patent  fixing his
rank  and the extent of assignment of lands conferred upon him 99
also with a  bÃ¡wat   or stick  similar to that of the  pÃ¡yung   or
umbrella  measuring about eight feet long  with which it is his duty to
measure the  sÃ¡wah  or rice fields

When a chief of the rank of  MÃ¡ntri  is appointed  he is furnished with
a  krÃ­s  handle and with a mat  which is carried behind him when he
moves about  as well for use as to shew his rank

The Javans include in the general term of  PriÃ¡yi  all persons above
the rank of common people  a term which in its general application on
Java is not very unlike that of gentlemen  or latterly of esquires  in
England

Among the forms of an eastern court  few are more particularly observed
than those relating to ambassadors  The Javans have long ceased to
send or receive ambassadors  but the following extracts from the  NÃ­ti
PrÃ¡ja   will shew what they conceive ought to be the qualifications and
conduct of such an officer

A person entrusted with a message from his prince  must never abuse
the trust placed in him  but always keep in sight that on such
occasions he is the representative of the prince  And chiefly  if he is
sent with a letter from the prince to a foreign country  in this case
he must be less submissive than before his own prince  According to
circumstances he must conduct himself with dissimulation  and before
he enters any foreign country  by some secret means or other  occasion
his own name  and that of the prince his master  to be spread over the
country  at the same time that he obtains every possible information
regarding the state of the country and people  On entering the country
he must assume a dignified appearance  and not speak or look about
him more than is necessary  Such conduct will inspire the people with
respect for him

The letter must be carried on the shoulder  and in his gait and speech
he must conduct himself with propriety  In delivering the letter he
must present himself with dignity  approach first  and then retire
from the person to whom the letter is directed  speak with him at a
distance  and not too familiarly

In all cases he must be careful not to go beyond his orders  His
deportment must be unassuming yet dignified  and having received an
answer for his prince  it is his duty to depart immediately  and to
proceed with it direct to the prince  without even going to his own
house first  If the letter is from some person lower in rank than
his master  he must not immediately shew it  but conceal it for a
time  but if it is from a prince of equal rank  then must he carry
the letter before him  When a letter is from a prince to one of his
subjects  it must be carried high  Coming in the presence of his
prince  he must carefully watch his eye  that he may deliver the letter
on the first intimation given by the prince that he is ready to receive
it

Whoever dictates a letter must be careful that a letter to a superior
is not couched in the same terms as a letter to an inferior

The three most remarkable events in the history of the individual are
his birth  his marriage  and his death  to these accordingly have the
greatest number of forms and ceremonies been attached

As soon as it is observed that a Javan woman is in the third month of
pregnancy  the event is communicated to all the nearest relations  to
whom  at the same time  presents are made  consisting of yellow rice
sweet scented oils  and wax candles  People of condition add some
cloths  gold  silver  or brass cups  as also needles  either of those
metals or of iron

After seven months  pregnancy  a festival is given to the relations
and friends  at which yellow rice forms invariably a part of the
entertainment

The pregnant woman must afterwards wash her body with the milk of a
green cocoa nut  on the shell of which has been previously carved
two handsome figures  one of each sex  by which the parents intend
to represent a standard of beauty for their expected offspring  and
to engrave on the imagination of the mother  impressions which may
extend to the lineaments of her infant  The nut must be opened by the
husband  She is next to bathe in water  into which many sweet scented
flowers have been thrown  and to dress herself with a new cloth  making
a present of the old one  together with money  raw rice   sÃ­rÃ­   and
cocoa nuts  to the midwife  who assists in her lustrations  On the
night of these ceremonies there must be a  wÃ¡yang  or scenic shadow
performed  the object of which is to represent the life and adventures
of a certain prince in the line of  DÃ©wa BatÃ¡ra BrÃ¡ma

If the woman is delivered of a son  the after birth is immediately cut
off with a very sharp knife of  bÃ¡mbu   wrapped in a piece of paper
on which is written the Javan alphabet  then laid in a new pot  and
buried in the ground  at which place a lamp  covered with a basket of
bÃ¡mbu   and adorned with leaves of the  pandÃ¡nri   is put  and kept
burning till the umbilical cord of the child falls off  When this takes
place  the child is watched the whole night  by persons who read the
history of the  DÃ©was   or of famous princes  or amuse themselves with
a  wÃ¡yang

As soon as the child is nine months old  the parents entertain their
relatives and friends with a  wÃ¡yang  and festival

Marriages are invariably contracted  not by the parties themselves
but by their parents or relations on their behalf  Such interference
which was common among the Greeks  without the same apology  is
rendered necessary by the early age at which the matrimonial union is
formed  and the incompetence of either of the intended couple to form a
discreet and prudent choice  During the period that intervenes between
the application of the friends of the boy to the parents or guardians
of the girl for their concurrence in the match  and the obtainment of
it  her condition is distinguished by the term  tÃ©tÃ¡kon   enquired
for   when the consent of her parents is obtained  it is termed  lÃ¡mar
solicited   According to ancient custom  after matters proceeded
thus far  a present of different valuables  termed  panÃ­ng sat  is
sent by the intended bridegroom to the bride  and her acceptance of
it  implying that she concurs in the previous steps taken towards her
settlement  renders the contract binding  The general prevalence of
similar customs cannot fail to strike those who are acquainted with
the nature of the  sponsalia dona  of the Romans  and the marriage
ceremonies detailed in various passages of Scripture  Genesis  ch  xv
2  xxiv  5   c   A present of this kind is described as being sent by
PÃ¡nji KÃ©rta PÃ¡ti  to the Princess  ChÃ¡ndra KirÃ¡na of DahÃ¡  100   and
we are told that it thence became a custom among the Javans

By any reluctance to complete his engagement  the bridegroom forfeits
to his betrothed these earnest gifts  as they may be called   while
on the other hand  if the obstacles to the completion of the marriage
originate with her  she is bound to return them  This present is also
called  patiba sÃ¡mpir

This custom  however  is now not so common as formerly  it is in a
great measure discontinued or confounded with the next ceremony  termed
sÃ¡rahan   delivered up   This consists in making various presents to
the bride a short time before the day fixed for the marriage  after the
delivery of which  the bride and bridegroom are confined to the house
until the ceremony takes place  The period varies  but with people of
distinction there generally elapses an interval of forty days between
the  sÃ¡rahan  and the marriage

On the day of the marriage  for which one that is considered
fortunate 101  is previously selected  the father of the bride proceeds
to the mosque  accompanied by the bridegroom  and informing the
PanghÃºlu  that the lad whom he presents has agreed to give the  sri
kÃ¡win   generally about two dollars   requests him to marry him to his
daughter  on which the  PanghÃºlu  inquires of the bridegroom whether he
has paid the amount  or is willing to do so  and upon the affirmative
being declared  he sanctifies the marriage by words to the following
effect

I join you   rÃ¡den mas   bridegroom   in wedlock with  sÃ¡tia   the
bride   with a pledge of two reals weight in gold or silver 102   You
take   sÃ¡tia   to be your wife for this world  You are obliged to pay
the pledge of your marriage   sri kÃ¡win    or to remain debtor for the
same  You are responsible for your wife in all and every thing  If
you should happen to be absent from her for the space of seven months
on shore  or one year at sea  without giving her any subsistence  and
are remiss in the performance of the duties which you owe to your
sovereign  your marriage shall be dissolved  if your wife requires it
without any further form or process  and you will be  besides  subject
to the punishment which the Mahomedan law dictates

Should any circumstance occur to prevent the bridegroom from attending
at the mosque on the day selected for the marriage  he follows the
singular custom of sending his  krÃ­s  103  to the ceremony  which is
deemed sufficient by the  PanghÃºlu   and afterwards he may appoint a
proxy to represent him in the processions which follow  But this is
seldom done when a man marries for the first time

After the ceremony  the bridegroom pays the priest the marriage fees
 salÃ¡wat    which ought  according to strict Mahomedans  not to
exceed fifteen stivers  In most instances  the fees are raised to five
times that sum in money  besides in many places a fowl  a hank of
cotton yarn  four  kÃ¡tis  of rice  two cocoa nuts   sÃ­ri   and fruit

On the wedding day  or sometimes the day following  the bridegroom
dressed in his best clothes  mounted on horseback  accompanied by all
his friends  and attended with music in the front and rear  proceeds at
noon to the dwelling of the bride  who  on his approach  comes out to
meet him at the door  In some districts  before their nearer approach
the bride and bridegroom throw simultaneously a bundle of  sÃ­ri  at
each other with considerable force  with the intention  it is said
of learning  from the dexterity with which the parties  respectively
perform this singular feat  and the success that attends it  which
of them will be able best to maintain their privileges  or gain an
ascendancy during the continuance of their union  They prognosticate
that  if the bundle of the bridegroom touch the head of the bride  it
is an infallible sign that he must rule  otherwise  the reverse

The bride  after this  receives the bridegroom with a low obeisance  in
testimony of her regard for him  extending similar marks of respect to
his parents  who attend him  The married couple are then placed in a
situation elevated above the rest of the company  and in token of their
afterwards living together  and sharing the same sustenance  commence
eating  sÃ­ri  from the same  sÃ­ri  box

In some districts  after leaving the mosque  the bridegroom and
his father proceed to the house of the bride s parents  where they
obtain her company in a procession through the village or town  On
these occasions  the bride is carried on a litter  which is generally
fashioned in the form of a  garÃºda   and the bridegroom is mounted
on horseback  All the relations and friends of the parties attend
carrying flowers and refreshments  together with the presents made to
the bridegroom on his marriage  The procession moves on to the sound
of the national music  and the occasional firing of cannon  A feast is
given in the evening at the house of the bride s parents  at which the
new married couple remain for the night  The term given to the bride
and bridegroom is  peng Ã¡nten   and the marriage ceremony is called
lÃ¡ki rÃ¡bi

On the next day in some districts  and on the fifth in others  the
bridegroom  or  peng Ã¡nten lÃ¡nang    and bride   peng anten wÃ¡don
together with the whole train of relations and friends  visit in
like manner the house of the bridegroom s father  This ceremony is
called  Ãºnduh mÃ¡ntu   accepting the daughter in law   There they both
again sit down to eat  sÃ­ri  in some place of distinction  similar
entertainments are repeated  and on the following day they return with
the same pomp and form to the bride s dwelling  the ceremony being now
completed

With the exception of the delivery of the  sri kÃ¡win   and the
procession to the mosque  there is very little in these ceremonies
conformable to the Mahomedan precepts

Marriages are frequently contracted between children  and then
termed  gÃ¡ntung kÃ¡win   hanging on marriages   but in this case the
parties are kept separate  and the principal ceremonies are reserved
till they attain the age of puberty  Such contracts proceed from a
laudable solicitude  on the part of parents  to provide a suitable
and advantageous match for their children as early as possible  and
to the same cause  as much  perhaps  as from the influence of climate
and intemperance of manners  may be attributed the early age  at which
matrimonial engagements are sometimes consummated

Whatever may be the reasons for such early marriages  one of the most
serious consequences is the facility with which they are dissolved  The
multiplication of divorces is mentioned by the poets  the moralists
and the historians of the Roman empire  as one of the greatest causes
and symptoms of the corruption and degeneracy of the period in which
they lived  and certainly it had proceeded to great lengths  when
Seneca could say that a woman computed her age  not by the annual
succession of consuls  but of husbands 104   The Javans  though
a simple people  are in this respect too like the profligate and
dissolute Romans

In no part of the world are divorces more frequent than on Java
for besides the facilities afforded by the Mahomedan ordinances  a
woman may at any time  when dissatisfied with her husband  demand a
dissolution of the marriage contract  by paying him a sum established
by custom  according to the rank of the parties  about twenty dollars
for a person of the lower orders  and fifty dollars for those of the
degree of  DemÃ¡ng  or  MÃ¡ntri   The husband is not bound to accept
it  but he is generally induced to do so  from a consideration
that the opinions and custom of the country require it  that his
domestic happiness would be sacrificed in a contest with his reluctant
companion  and that  by continuing his attachment  he would incur the
shame of supporting one who treated him with aversion or contempt
This kind of divorce is termed  mÃ¡nchal   The husband may at any time
divorce his wife  on making a settlement upon her sufficient to support
her according to her condition in life

A widow may marry again at the expiration of three months and ten days
after her husband s death

When a person of rank or property dies  all his relations  male and
female  meet at the house of the deceased  to testify their grief at
the death and their respect for the memory of the departed  On that
occasion  what is termed  selÃ¡mat  money is distributed among all
according to circumstances  The priests  who are to perform the service
at the place of interment  receive a Spanish dollar  a piece of cloth
and a small mat each

When the corpse is washed 105  and wrapped in a white cloth  it is
carried out of the house on a bier covered with coloured chintz  on
which garlands of flowers are hung as drapery  On this occasion  no
means of costly pomp or impressive solemnity are neglected in the use
of umbrellas   pÃ¡yung    pikes  and other insignia of honour  All the
relations and friends accompany the corpse to the grave  where the
priest addresses a prayer to heaven and delivers an exhortation to the
soul of the deceased  of which the substance commonly is   that it
should be conscious of being the work of the Creator of the universe
and after leaving its earthly dwelling  should speed its way to the
source whence it issued   After this ceremony the corpse is interred
and the other priests continue their prayers and benedictions

For seven successive nights  the same priests meet and pray at the
house of the deceased  in the presence of his relations

On the third  seventh  fourteenth  hundredth  and thousandth day or
night after the death of a person  are observed particular festivals
or solemn feasts in his commemoration  on which occasions prayers are
offered up for the happiness of his soul

The body is interred after the usual manner of the Mahomedans  and a
sambÃ³ja  tree is usually planted by its side  It is the universal
practice of the relatives of the deceased to strew the graves several
times in the year with the sweet scented flowers of the  sulÃ¡si   the
tulsi  of Bengal   which are raised exclusively for this purpose  The
burial grounds are  in general  well chosen  In  KedÃº   where the most
beautiful eminences have been selected for this purpose  and where
the  cambÃ´ja  tree grows with the greatest luxuriance  they form very
interesting objects in the landscape  The burial places of the royal
family and of the nobles of the country are usually called  astÃ¡na
they are surrounded by one or more high walls  and in general by
stately  warÃ­ng en  trees  The tombs are sometimes ornamented with
sculptural devices and well executed inscriptions  either in the Javan
or Arabic character  They are kept clean and repaired by contributions
from all parts of the country  under the superintendence of priests
appointed to that particular duty  and are respected and guarded with
religious veneration and zeal  The burial place of the family now on
the throne is at  MegÃ­ri   in the province of  MatÃ¡rem   a few miles
distant from the modern capital of  YÃºgya kÃ©rta

As the Javans are still devotedly attached to their ancient customs
and ceremonies  few of which they have sacrificed to their new faith
I shall  in order to give a better idea of those still observed on
the most remarkable occasions  present a short account of their state
anterior to the introduction of Mahomedanism  as far as it can be
ascertained  Though  as Mahomedans  they are averse to an open avowal
of Pagan practices  they still preserve them more or less  according
as the parties happen to be less or more under the influence of Arab
priests

When a woman was pregnant with her first child  at the expiration of
four months a feast was given  at which yellow rice was served up  This
entertainment was insignificant compared with that which was observed
at the expiration of seven months  when the guests were presented
with cloth  gold  silver  and steel  according to the means of the
parties  a piece of steel never failing to be one of the gifts  though
it did not exceed the size of a needle  On this occasion a new bath
was prepared in the evening  and watched during the night by the light
of a lamp  At the side of the bath were laid two stalks of the dark
coloured sugar cane  as an offering to  BatÃ¡ra KÃ¡la   a painted cloth
of the pattern  tÃºwuh wÃ¡tu   and a young cocoa nut   chÃ©nkir gÃ¡ding
on which was engraved the resemblance of  PÃ¡nji KÃ©rta PÃ¡ti  and his
wife  ChÃ¡ndra KirÃ¡na  of  DÃ¡ha   In the morning the wife  after putting
on the cloth  entered the bath  when the water from the young cocoa nut
was poured over her  during the day it was also incumbent on her to
change her dress seven times  At the feast given on this occasion
fish  flesh  and fowl were invariably served up  and performances of
the  wÃ¡yang  were exhibited

Immediately on the birth of the child it was placed in a kind of
basket made of  bÃ¡mbu   in form similar to the sieve or farming basket
used for separating the chaff from the rice   the relations were
assembled  and the remains of the umbilical cord were carefully cut
off by means of a piece of sharpened  bÃ¡mbu   The part abstracted by
this operation was deposited in the interior of a cocoa nut  with a
lump of turmerick placed under it  This cocoa nut was ornamented on
the outside with the twenty letters of the Javan alphabet  It was
afterwards put into an earthen pot  and either buried under ground or
thrown into the sea  A stone rolling pin  dressed up like a baby  was
placed in the basket in its stead  The female relations relieved each
other through the day and night  in constantly supporting the child in
their arms  till the navel was healed  the male relations all the while
reading and reciting the history of  RÃ¡ma   and other mythological and
historical romances  As soon as the child was recovered  a grand feast
was observed  with performances of the  wÃ¡yang   Near the  DÃ¡lang
director of the  wÃ¡yang   was placed a bowl of pure water  into which
fresh and sweet scented flowers were cast  two black sugar canes
a cloth of the  tÃºwuh wÃ¡tu  pattern  and a piece of white cloth
together with a bundle of  pÃ¡ri  and different kinds of eatables  On
this occasion was exhibited the drama of  BatÃ¡ra DÃºrga  and  Sang Yang
JÃ¡gat NÃ¡ta   one of the designations of  GÃºru    at that passage where
during the first two quarters of the moon  the former appeared in her
amiable character of  Uma  106   and where  in the city of  KÃºru SÃ©tra
GÃ¡ndamÃ¡yu   she is delivered of a son   BatÃ¡ra KÃ¡la   having the form
of a  RasÃ¡ksa    greedy to destroy and devour mankind   At that part of
the performance when  Sang Yang JÃ¡gat NÃ¡ta  takes the child on his lap
the  DÃ¡lang  did the same with the infant  repeating the invocation
 hong  ila heng    several times  and afterwards returning it into the
hands of the father  On this occasion the  wÃ¡yang  was performed from
seven o clock in the evening till eight o clock in the morning

When the child was forty days old  its head was shaved  as directed
by the parent  and the ceremony took place of giving it whatever name
should be determined on by the father and the elders

The  DÃºkun   midwife  who attended at the delivery  was entitled
to receive for her trouble fourteen  wang   about a rupee  if it
was an ordinary birth  but in difficult cases her allowance was
proportionately increased  Her attendance continued for the mornings
and evening of forty days  at the expiration of which she was further
entitled to receive a present of two pieces of cloth  one small and
one large  four  kÃ¡tis  of rice  two cocoa nuts  and some  sÃ­ri   If
required to attend beyond that period  she was paid accordingly  A
DÃºkun  once employed  could not be exchanged on any account during
the forty days  Women invariably acted as midwives  in other cases the
medical art was practised exclusively by the men

On the child s attaining its seventh month  a feast was given  when
it was for the first time placed with its feet on the ground  At this
entertainment rice cakes and sweetmeats of different colours and kinds
were served up  and if it happened that the child had come into the
world either as the sun was just rising or setting  a bundle of grass
or rubbish was thrown into the basket  upon the top of which it was
placed for a few minutes  after which one of the elders taking the
child into his arms repeated the following words    Hong   amilam
mastÃºna masidam  sÃºming gÃ¡ha yÃ©wang Kala ing w ru ajal amÃºla nÃ­ra
ana nÃ­ra  Sang yang SÃ¡ba lan BatÃ¡ri DÃºrga    which after an invocation
to the Deity would express   Begone  oh God  KÃ¡la   for I am not
ignorant of thy nature  nor of thy being descended from  Sang Yang SÃ¡ba
GÃºru   and  BatÃ¡ra DÃºrga  107

When the child attained the age of one year  another feast was given in
commemoration of its nativity  and this universally among all classes
of people  those who possessed the means kept the anniversary of their
birth day until their death

Marriages were invariably contracted by the relations of the parties
by the paternal grandfather or grandmother if living  if not by the
parents  and in case of their demise  by the natural guardian  Thus the
brother  on the death of his parents  was permitted to dispose of the
hand of his sister  and a deviation from this course was deprecated  as
laying a foundation for quarrels and dissensions

The consent of the relations being obtained  the bridegroom was bound
to serve the parents of the bride for a year 108

For forty days previous to the celebration of the marriage  the parties
were not allowed to go to a distance from their homes  or to be
employed in any severe labour

At sunset on the wedding day  the bridegroom went in procession to
visit the parents of the bride  after which she was visited by his
parents  who on these occasions gave the married couple their blessing
wishing them happiness as lasting as that enjoyed by the god  KÃ¡majÃ¡ya
with his consort  KÃ¡marÃ¡ti

One of the elders  or an  Ajar   then repeated the following
benediction

 Hong  GÃ¡ng ga trigÃ¡ng ga  pinÃ¡yung hana kala chÃ¡kra kinÃ¡sih hÃ¡na
pra dewÃ¡ta hipÃ¡ta ing sapudÃ©nda tulÃºsa amÃ¡ndan warÃ­ng en     Hail  holy
water  thrice holy water  be it as a covering to shield you from harm
may the gods be merciful unto you  henceforth be nourishing as the
pÃ¡ndan  and  warÃ­ng en  trees

In these processions the bridegroom was obliged to prepare whatever
ornaments  trinkets  or gifts  the mother of the bride had fixed
her fancy upon  either at the birth of her daughter or on any other
occasion  whether they consisted in the representation of a white
elephant  a white tiger  or the like

Five days after the consecration of the marriage  the parents of the
bride  with whom she staid for that period  prepared a feast  at
which was invariably served up among other things yellow rice  This
entertainment was given to mark the period of the consummation  and
after celebrating such an event  it was thought proper that the bride
should be on a visit to the parents of her husband  remain under their
roof  share their protection  and subsist at their expense for forty
days without going abroad  at the expiration of which the new married
couple were at liberty to go to their own house and pursue their
own plans of life  becoming liable to contribute their share to the
revenues and demands of the state

The dresses worn on the nuptial day are thus described in the romance
of  PÃ¡nji

It being arranged that at the same time when  RÃ¡din PÃ¡nji  was to
receive the princess  DÃ©wi ChÃ¡ndra KirÃ¡na  in marriage   RÃ©tna JinÃ³li
his sister  should also be married to  GÃºnung SÃ¡ri   son of the Prince
of  DÃ¡ha   the Prince of  DÃ¡ha  departed with a joyful heart  and
gave the necessary directions to prepare the clothing and ornaments
necessary for the two brides

 KlÃ¡na JÃ¡yang SÃ¡ri  109   accompanied by his sister   RÃ©tna JinÃ³li
and his numerous followers then entered the  dÃ¡lam  of the prince
KlÃ¡na JÃ¡yang SÃ¢ri  wore on the occasion a  dÃ³dot  of silk stamped with
flowers of gold  his  chelÃ¡na  were of the green  chindi  ornamented
with golden lace round the bottom  and studded with  kÃºnang kÃºnang
golden ornaments made to represent the fire fly   his  sumping
ornaments at the back of the ear  were of golden flowers studded with
diamonds  On the third finger of each hand he wore two diamond rings
His waistband or belt was a painted cloth  of the pattern  grÃ­ngsing
sang u pÃ¡ti   his  krÃ­s  of the  kaprÃ¡bon   his  jÃ¡mang   or head
ornament  of gold set with diamonds  and scented with all kinds of
sweet scented oils  He appeared more beautiful than a deity descended
from heaven  all looking upon him with delight and astonishment

His sister   RÃ©tna JinÃ³li   was dressed nearly after the same fashion
as the Princess  Ang rÃ©ni

The dress of  DÃ©wi Ang rÃ©ni   when married  was as follows  her
dÃ³dot  was of a pink colour stamped with flowers  her  kÃ©ndit   zone
of which the ends hang in front  was  mandÃ¡la gÃ­ri   yellow with red at
each end   her  jÃ¡mang  of golden flowers  her golden ear rings of the
bÃ¡pang  fashion  with a diamond in the centre  her hair according to
the  glung mÃ¡lang   a particular kind of knot   in which were placed
beautiful and sweet scented flowers  the fine hair round her forehead
fashioned into small curls  with a sprinkling of powder  her eyebrows
shaped like the  Ã­mba  leaf  She wore golden armlets of the  kÃ¡lung
pattern  ornamented with drops  Her  kÃ¡lung   or necklace  was of the
mÃ©ng gah  fashion  She wore two rings on the little and third finger
of each hand  like unto a  widadÃ¡ri

There were three modes of disposing of the body of a deceased person
by fire  termed  Ã³bÃ³ng   by water  termed  lÃ¡rung   or by exposing it
upright against a tree in a forest  where it was left to decay  termed
sÃ©tra   When the body of a chief or person of consequence was burnt
it was usual to preserve the ashes  and to deposit them in a  chÃ¡ndi
or tomb

It was the custom with all classes of people on Java to give
an entertainment or feast on the decease of their friends and
relations 110   The first feast was given on the day of the death  a
second on the third day after  a third on the seventh day  a fourth
on the fortieth day  a fifth on the hundredth day  and a sixth on the
thousandth day after the decease of the party  after which an annual
feast was observed  with more or less pomp  according to the respect in
which the deceased was held  or the circumstances of the friends and
relatives who celebrated his memory

Besides these regular feasts and ceremonies  others prescribed by the
wÃºku  111  were religiously observed  When the day  ang gÃ¢ra  fell on
the  pÃ¡ncha klÃ­won   it was considered a propitious time for preferring
petitions to the gods  On the seventh day of the  wÃºku galingÃ¡n
sacred to  BatÃ¡ra KÃ¡majÃ¡ya   they relaxed from all worldly pursuits
and offered praises and prayers to the gods collectively  it being
supposed that they were assembled on that day  On the  wÃºku gÃºmreg
sacred to  BatÃ¡ra SÃ¡kra   every villager joined in a feast sacred to
the earth   pÃºja bÃºmi    and this  wÃºku  was particularly observed by
the people termed  KÃ¡lang   who  during the seven days performed no
work  but employed themselves in visiting the tombs of their deceased
friends and relations  or in feasting with their living relatives
During the whole of that period they kept in their houses a lighted
lamp  which they carefully preserved from extinction

It may not be inappropriate to introduce in this place a short
digression  containing an account of some of the customs peculiar to
the people termed  KÃ¡lang   and to the inhabitants of the  Teng ger
mountains  The former are said to have been at one time numerous in
various parts of Java  leading a wandering life  practising religious
rites different from those of the great body of the people  and
avoiding intercourse with them  but most of them are now reduced to
subjection  are become stationary in their residence  and have embraced
the Mahomedan faith  A few villages in which their particular customs
are still preserved  occur in the provinces of  KendÃ¡l    KÃ¡liwÃºng u
and  DÃ©mak   and although the tradition of the country regarding their
descent from an unnatural connection between a princess of  Mendang
KamÃºlan  and a chief  who had been transformed into a dog  would
mark them out as a strange race  they have claims to be considered as
the actual descendants of the aborigines of the Island 112   They are
represented as having a high veneration for a  red dog   one of which
is generally kept by each family  and which they will  on no account
allow to be struck or ill used by any one  When a young man asks a girl
in marriage  he must prove his descent from their peculiar stock  A
present of rice and cotton yarn  among other articles  must be offered
by him  and carried to the intended bride  by an elderly man or woman
of his own race  which offering must  in like manner  be received by an
elderly relation of the girl  from this moment until the marriage is
duly solemnized  nothing whatever is allowed to be taken out of either
hut  On the marriage day  a buffalo s head  covered with white  red
or black rice powder  is placed on the ground near the place intended
for the bride to sleep upon  and the elderly people and relations being
assembled  they dance by pairs  at the end of each dance presenting
the bride to the bridegroom  and making such offerings as they think
proper  The bridegroom is  on this occasion  accompanied to the house
of the bride s father by as many friends as he can procure  and is
bound to bring with him not less than a pair of buffaloes  a plough
harrow  hoe   pachul    and whip  with a bundle of  pÃ¡ri   Those who
are in good circumstances are further bound to add a cart   pedÃ¡ti
to the above mentioned stock  Prior to the equipment of the bride and
bridegroom for the entertainment  it is essential that their bodies
be rubbed over with the ashes of a  red dog s  bones  At sunset they
both eat rice together off the same leaf  On the following night they
jointly partake of the buffalo s head  which is previously laid by the
side of the place where they sleep  On the third day they proceed to
the house of the bridegroom s father  making as much show as possible
and go round the extent of the village confines  preceded by people
carrying a bed  cooking utensils  a spinning wheel and loom  On the
death of a  KÃ¡lang   the body is carried in procession to the dwellings
of the relations  who join in the ceremony  and proceed with it to
the place of interment  they then pass round the corpse three times
before it is lowered into the grave  the women crying aloud  A young
cocoa nut is then split in two  and the water from it poured into the
grave  one half of the shell being placed at the head  the other at the
feet of the deceased  On their return home  the feasts and ceremonies
are the same as those noticed in the practice of the other inhabitants
of Java  Whenever the  KÃ¡langs  move from one place to another  they
are conveyed in carts  having two solid wheels with a revolving
axle  and drawn by two or more pairs of buffaloes  according to the
circumstances of the party  In these they place the materials of which
their huts are constructed  their implements of husbandry  and other
articles of necessity or value  In this manner  until of late years
since they have been subjected to the regulations of the Javan chiefs
they were continually moving from one part of the island to another
They have still their separate chiefs  and preserve many of their
peculiar customs  Those who are Mahomedans employ in their religious
functions priests who differ from others in being less scrupulous  They
have always been treated with so much contempt by the Javans  that
KÃ¡lang  is an epithet of reproach and disgrace

To the eastward of  SurabÃ¡ya   and on the range of hills connected with
GÃºnung DÃ¡sar   and lying partly in the district of  PasÃºruan  and
partly in that of  Probolingo   known by the name of the  Teng ger
mountains  we find the remnant of a people still following the Hindu
worship  who merit attention  not only on account of their being   if
we except the  BÃ©dui  of Bantam  who will be hereafter noticed  the
sole depositaries of the rites and doctrines of that religion existing
at this day on Java  but as exhibiting an interesting singularity and
simplicity of character

These people occupy about forty villages  scattered along this range
of hills in the neighbourhood of what is termed the sandy sea  The
site of their villages  as well as the construction of their houses
are peculiar  and differ entirely from what is elsewhere observed
on Java  They are not shaded by trees  but built on spacious open
terraces  rising one above the other  each house occupying a terrace
and being in length from thirty to seventy  and even eighty feet  The
door is invariably in one corner  at the end of the building  opposite
to that in which the fire place is built  The building appears to be
constructed with the ordinary roof  having along the front an enclosed
veranda or gallery  about eight feet broad  The fire place is built of
brick  and is so highly venerated  that it is considered a sacrilege
for any stranger to touch it  Across the upper part of the building
rafters are run  so as to form a kind of attic story  in which are
deposited the most valuable property and implements of husbandry

The head of the village takes the title of  PÃ©ting gi   as in the
low lands  and is generally assisted by a  KabÃ¡yan   both elected by
the people from their own village  There are four priests  who are
here termed  DÃºkuns   a term elsewhere only applied to doctors and
midwives   having charge of the state records and the sacred books

These  DÃºkuns   who are in general intelligent men  can give no account
of the era when they were first established on these hills  they can
produce no traditional history of their origin  whence they came  or
who entrusted them with the sacred books  to the faith contained in
which they still adhere  These  they concur in stating  were handed
down to them by their fathers  to whose hereditary office of preserving
them they have succeeded  The sole duty required of them is again to
hand them down in safety to their children  and to perform the  pÃºja
praise giving  according to the directions they contain  These records
consist of three compositions  written on the  lÃ³ntar  leaf  detailing
the origin of the world  disclosing the attributes of the deity  and
prescribing the forms of worship to be observed on different occasions

When a woman is delivered of her first child  the  DÃºkun  takes a leaf
of the  Ã¡lang Ã¡lang  grass  and scraping the skin of the hands of
the mother and her infant  as well as the ground  pronounces a short
benediction

When a marriage is agreed upon  the bride and bridegroom being brought
before the  DÃºkun  within the house  in the first place bow with
respect towards the south  then to the fire place  then to the earth
and lastly  on looking up to the upper story of the house  where the
implements of husbandry are placed  The parties then submissively
bowing to the  DÃºkun   he repeats a prayer  commencing with the words
 Hong  KendÃ¡ga BrÃ¡ma ang  gas sÃ­wang ga Ã¡na ma siwÃ¡ha sangyang
g ni sira kang  113     c   while the bride washes the feet of the
bridegroom  At the conclusion of this ceremony  the friends and family
of the parties make presents to each of krÃ­ses  buffaloes  implements
of husbandry   c   in return for which the bride and bridegroom
respectfully present them with betel leaf

At the marriage feast which ensues  the  DÃºkun  repeats two  pÃºja
The marriage is not  however  consummated till the fifth day after
the above ceremony  This interval between the solemnities and the
consummation of marriage is termed by them  Ãºndang mÃ¡ntu   and is in
some cases still observed by the Javans in other parts of the island
under the name  Ãºnduh mÃ¡ntu

At the interment of an inhabitant of  Teng ger   the corpse is lowered
into the grave with the head placed towards the south  contrary to
the direction observed by the Mahomedans   and is guarded from the
immediate contact of the earth by a covering of  bÃ¡mbus  and planks
When the grave is closed  two posts are planted over the body  one
erected perpendicularly on the breast  the other on the lower part of
the belly  and between them is placed a hollowed  bÃ¡mbu  in an inverted
position  into which  during seven successive days  they daily pour a
vessel of pure water  laying beside the  bÃ¡mbu  two dishes  also daily
replenished with eatables  At the expiration of the seventh day  the
feast of the dead is announced  and the relations and friends of the
deceased assemble to be present at the ceremony  and to partake of
entertainments conducted in the following manner

A figure of about half a cubit high  representing the human form
made of leaves and ornamented with variegated flowers  is prepared
and placed in a conspicuous situation  supported round the body by
the clothes of the deceased  The  DÃºkun  then places in front of the
garland an incense pot with burning ashes  together with a vessel
containing water  and repeats the two  pÃºja  to fire and water  the
former commencing with   Hong  KendÃ¡ga BrÃ¡ma gangsi wang ga ya nama
sÃ­wÃ¡ha     c   the latter with   Hong  hong gang ga mÃ¡ha tirta rÃ¡ta
mejil sÃ¡king hÃ¡ti     c   burning  dÃºpa  or incense at stated periods
during the former  and occasionally sprinkling the water over the feast
during the repetition of the latter

The clothes of the deceased are then divided among the relatives
and friends  the garland is burned  another  pÃºja   commencing with
 Hong  Ã¡wigna mastÃºna ma sidam  hong  arÃ¡ning     c  is repeated
while the remains of the sacred water are sprinkled over the feast
The parties now sit down to the enjoyment of it  invoking a blessing
from the Almighty on themselves  their houses  and their lands  No more
solemnities are observed till the expiration of a thousand days  when
if the memory of the deceased is beloved and cherished  the ceremony
and feast are repeated  if otherwise  no further notice is taken of
him  and having thus obtained what the Romans would call his  justa
he is allowed to be forgotten

Being questioned regarding the tenets of their religion  they replied
that they believed in a  dÃ©wa   who was all powerful  that the name
by which the  dÃ©wa  was designated was  BÃºmi TrÃºka SÃ¡ng yÃ¡ng DewÃ¡ta
BÃ¢tur   and that the particulars of their worship were contained in a
book called  PÃ¡nglÃ¡wu   which they presented to me

On being questioned regarding the  Ã¡dat  against adultery  theft  and
other crimes  their reply was unanimous and ready  that crimes of
this kind were unknown to them  and that consequently no punishment
was fixed  either by law or custom  that if a man did wrong  the head
of the village chid him for it  the reproach of which was always
sufficient punishment for a man of  Teng ger   This account of their
moral character is fully confirmed by the Regents of the districts
under whose authority they are placed  and also by the Residents
They  in fact  seem to be almost without crime  and are universally
peaceable  orderly  honest  industrious  and happy  They are
unacquainted with the vice of gambling and the use of opium

The aggregate population is about twelve hundred souls  and they
occupy  without exception  the most beautifully rich and romantic spots
on Java  a region  in which the thermometer is frequently as low as
forty two  The summits and slopes of the hills are covered with Alpine
firs  and plants common to an European climate flourish in luxuriance

Their language does not differ much from the Javan of the present day
though more gutturally pronounced  Upon a comparison of about a hundred
words with the vernacular Javan  two only were found to differ  They
do not marry or intermix with the people of the low lands  priding
themselves on their independence and purity in this respect 114

The  BÃ©dui  are in numbers inconsiderable  and found in the interior
of Bantam  they are the descendants of those who escaped into the
woods after the fall of the western capital of  PajajÃ¡ran  115  in
the fifteenth century  and would not change their religion  remaining
firmly attached to that of  PrÃ¡bu SÃ©da   There is a tomb of one of
them which they hold sacred  and will not allow any one but themselves
to approach even to this day  When the  BÃ©dui  subsequently submitted
to the Sultan of Bantam  and shewed no disposition to oppose the
Mahomedans  they were not compelled to become converts  but it was
agreed  at the same time they admitted  that the number of the
RowÃ¡ ian   the name given to their little societies  should be limited
to three or four

The  BÃ©dui  attend to all orders they receive through the medium of
the village chief  They subsist by cultivating rice  all they raise
beyond what is required for their own consumption they sell to the
hill people  who are in the habit of going to them for it once a year
on account of the superior quality of the rice  or rather superior
estimation in which it is held  It is an established rule among them to
allot but one day for each of the different successive operations of
husbandry  one day for cutting down the trees and underwood  one day
for clearing what has been so cut down  one day for sowing the grain
one for weeding the field  and one for reaping  one for binding up
the grain and one for carrying it home  If any part of what has been
reaped cannot be carried home in one day  it is left and neglected
The  GÃ­rang pÃ³hon   which is the title of the chief  is the first who
commences the work of the field  and many of the hill people follow him
in regard to the period for sowing their  pÃ¡ri

Their dress consists of white and black cloths  They wear rings and
silver scabbards to their  krises   but gold and  swasa  they dislike
Spanish dollars are the only coin they prize

The festivals or feasts of the Javans are of three kinds  the  grÃ©beg
or religious festivals  the  banchÃ¡ki  or  nealamÃ¡ti   so called
from the Arabic  salÃ¡mat   a blessing   held on the celebration of
marriages  births  and circumcision  and the  sedÃ©kah   appointed in
honour of the dead  and for the celebration of their memory

The principal and most important of these are the national
entertainments corresponding with the Mahomedan festivals of  mÃºlut
pÃ¡sa   and  bÃ©sar   the two first answering to the half yearly
festivals of the Arabs of  mohÃ¡ram  and  ramÃ¡zan   and the latter with
that of  khÃ¡ji   in the month of dulkhija  On these occasions the
sovereign appears in public  and the  Ã¡lun Ã¡lun  is crowded with an
assemblage of people from all quarters  every one being dressed in his
most splendid attire  and accompanied by all his armed followers  The
same is observed in the more distant provinces of the country  where
the petty chiefs  in like manner  assemble in the  Ã¡lun Ã¡lun  of the
Regent  Presents of fruit  poultry  and other kinds of provisions
are brought from every part of the country  offerings are made by the
chiefs to the mosques  and a public festival is given by the chief
authorities  The men only partake of these public feasts  but the
female part of the family of the chiefs assemble together  and enjoy
corresponding entertainments within their chambers  The festival seldom
lasts above one day

Of the  banchÃ¡ki  and  nealamÃ¡ti  it may be only necessary to observe
that those given during the ceremonies consequent upon the birth of the
first child are most important

The  sedÃ©kah  are solemnities observed on the occasion of the funeral
or in honour of the memory of a departed relative  on the seventh
fortieth  one hundredth  or thousandth day after his decease  they
are distinguished from the feasts of  grÃ©beg  and  nealamÃ¡ti  by the
absence of music  Those who intend to observe them  assemble on the
preceding evening in order to read some portion of the  Koran   Before
the guests partake of the meal  the principal person present generally
addresses the Almighty in a prayer  which alludes to the occasion
and expresses gratitude for the repast which his bounty has provided
Thankfulness to the earthly donor of the entertainment often mingles
itself with gratitude to heaven  and the praises of both are celebrated
at the same time  This grace before meals is called  dÃºng a

Reserving for a subsequent chapter a sketch of the music and poetry of
the Javans  I shall in this place endeavour to give some account of
their national drama and dances  as constituting  next to music and
poetry  the most conspicuous and refined of their amusements

The dramatic entertainments are of two kinds  the  tÃ³peng   wherein
the characters are represented by men  who except when performing
before the Sovereign wear masks  and the  wÃ¡yang   in which they are
represented by shadows

The subject of the  tÃ³peng  is invariably taken from the adventures
of  PÃ¡nji   the favourite hero of Javan story  In the performances
before the Sovereign  where masks are not used  the several characters
themselves rehearse their parts  but  in general  the  DÃ¡lang
or manager of the entertainment  recites the speeches  while the
performers have only to  suit the action to the word   The music
of the  gÃ¡melan  accompanies the piece  and varies in expression
according to the nature of the action or the kind of emotion to be
excited  The actors are splendidly dressed after the ancient costume
and perform their parts with grace  elegance  and precision  but the
whole performance has more the character of a ballet than that of a
regular dramatic exhibition  either of the tragic or coming kind  in
which human passions  human follies or sufferings  are represented in
such appropriate language and just action  as to seem only a reflection
of nature  Love and war are the constant themes  and the combats of
contending chiefs generally close the scene  Those who perform before
the sovereign and repeat their parts  previously study their characters
from written compositions expressly prepared for the purpose  but in
other cases  the  DÃ¡lang   well versed in the principal incidents
descriptions  and speeches of the history  furnishes the dialogue
between the actors extempore  A party of  tÃ´peng  generally consists of
ten persons  besides the  DÃ¡lang   of whom four play the  gÃ¡melan  and
six perform the characters  They are engaged to play by the night  for
about ten rupees  twenty five shillings  and a supper

Buffoonery is sometimes introduced  to increase the zest of these
entertainments with the multitude  but it does not interfere with the
regular course of the performance  the actors being only disturbed
occasionally by the actions of an extraneous character  who whether
representing a dog  a monkey  or an idiot  seldom fails to excite
considerable mirth  and not unfrequently in the most interesting part
of the performance

There is also a kind of pantomime  or rather an assemblage of wild
beasts called  BarÃºng an   in this entertainment men dressed up to
represent various animals are made to appear in procession and combats
This is generally performed for the amusement of children  and is only
accompanied by the beat of the  gÃ³ng  and drum

In the  wÃ¡yangs   or scenic shadows  the subject of the performances
is taken from the earliest period of history and fable  down to the
destruction of the Hindu empire of  MajapÃ¡hit   These are distinguished
according to the periods of the history which they represent  by the
terms  wÃ¡yang pÃºrwa    wÃ¡yang gÃ©dog   and  wÃ¡yang klÃ­tik

The different characters in the history are in these  wÃ¡yangs
represented by figures  about eighteen inches or two feet high  stamped
or cut out of pieces of thick leather  generally of buffalo s hide
which are painted and gilt with great care and at considerable expense
so as to form some supposed resemblance of the character to the
individual intended to be personified  The whole figure is  however
strangely distorted and grotesque  the nose in particular being
unnaturally prominent  There is a tradition  that the figures were
first so distorted by the  SusÃºnan MÃ³ria   one of the early Mahomedan
teachers  in order to render the preservation of the ancient amusements
of the country compatible with a due obedience to the Mahomedan
precept  which forbids any exhibition or dramatic representation of the
human form   By these means   said the  SusÃºnan  with much ingenuity
while the world in general will not imagine the figures to be human
the Javans  from recollecting their history  will yet be able to
comprehend the characters they are intended to represent  and enjoy in
secret their national amusements  Or if  in time  they should forget
the originals  and confound them with the distorted resemblance  they
will be impressed with the idea  that it was only after conversion
to the faith of the Prophet that their ancestors assumed the present
shape of man   But the comparatively recent alteration in the figures
is rendered doubtful from the circumstance of similar figures being
found on many of the more ancient coins  thus affording ground for an
opinion  that they existed nearly in their present form before the
introduction of Mahomedanism  Their antiquity is further confirmed  by
the existence of similar figures in the Hindu island of  BÃ¡li   where
though not so much distorted  they are still far from natural  These
figures are fastened upon a horn spike  and have a piece of thin horn
hanging from each hand  by means of which the arms  which are jointed
at the elbow and shoulder  can be moved at the discretion of the
manager  A white cloth or curtain is then drawn tight over an oblong
frame of ten or twelve feet long and five feet high  and being placed
in front of the spectators  is rendered transparent by means of a
hanging lamp behind it  The several figures are made in turn to appear
and act their parts  Previous to the commencement of this performance
the  DÃ¡lang   who is seated behind the curtain  arranges the different
characters on each side of the curtain  by sticking them into a long
plantain stem which is laid along the bottom  The  gÃ¡melan  then
commences  and as the several characters present themselves  extracts
of the history are repeated  and the dialogue is carried on  generally
at the discretion and by the invention of the  DÃ¡lang   Without this
personage nothing can be done  for he not only puts the puppets in
motion  but repeats their parts  interspersing them with detached
verses from the romance illustrative of the story  and descriptive of
the qualities of the different heroes  He is the soul which directs and
animates the whole order and machinery of the piece  regulating the
time of the music with a small hammer which he holds in his hand  while
he recites the speeches suited to the occasion

In the  wÃ¡yang purwa   or  wÃ¡yang  of the most ancient times  the
subject is taken from the earliest periods of fabulous history  down
to the reign of  ParikÃ©sit  inclusive  This is the age of interesting
story and marvellous fiction  the reign of the gods  demigods  and
heroes of the Hindu and Javan mythology  who in these representations
are exhibited with the attributes  and in the situations with which
their names are connected in the most popular poems and romances  The
fables thus turned to account  are generally taken from the poem of
RÃ¡ma   the poem of  MintarÃ¡ga  containing the penance of  ArjÃºna  on
the mountain  Indra   and the celebrated epic of the  BrÃ¡ta YÃºdha
or the war of the  PandÃ¡wa   These poems are all written in what are
termed the high measures  and are accompanied in their recital by the
gÃ¡melan salÃ©ndro   In the performance of this  wÃ¡yang   the  DÃ¡lang
first recites a few verses in the  KÃ¡wi  language  chaunting afterwards
an interpretation of the passage in Javan  for the use of the
unlearned  As the several characters are brought forward  he himself
supplies the minor dialogue between the dramatis personÃ¦  keeping in
general close to the original story  when there is any person present
who could detect his deviations  if he is performing before the
ignorant  however  he frequently digresses from the main story  in
any way which he thinks may most readily amuse his audience  and on
this account  the practice of rendering the  KÃ¡wi  into Javan  which
furnishes an opportunity for such deviations  is termed  charÃ¡ngan
literally a branch from a tree  In the course of the entertainment
all the varieties of ancient weapons named in these poems are
represented behind the transparent curtain  The interest excited by
such spectacles  connected with national recollections  is almost
inconceivable  The eager multitude will sit listening with rapturous
delight and profound attention for whole nights to these rude dramas
By means of them  the lower class have an opportunity of picking up a
few  KÃ¡wi  terms  and of becoming acquainted with the ancient legends
of the country

The subject of the  wÃ¡yang gÃ©dog  is taken from the period of history
subsequent to  ParikÃ©sit   commencing with the reign of  Gandra yÃ¡na
and including the adventures and reign of the celebrated  PÃ¡nji
and that of his successor  LalÃ©an   until he established himself at
PajajÃ¡ran   These poems being composed in a different measure  the
gÃ¡melan pÃ©log  is employed as the accompaniment  and although the
history of the early part of this period is written in the  KÃ¡wi
the  DÃ¡lang  always employs the Javan translation  The adventures of
PÃ¡nji  compose the most popular portion of it  The characters are
numerous  and the figures in general more highly coloured and better
finished than those of the  wÃ¡yang pÃºrwa   In bringing any hero on the
stage  the  DÃ¡lang  recites those verses of the history which relate to
him  and introduces such dialogue as may give a dramatic effect to the
exhibition  together with such explanations as may make it intelligible
to common capacities

In the  wÃ¡yang klÃ­tik  the figures exhibited are more properly puppets
than shadows  they are of wood  about ten inches high  and made to
perform their parts without the intervention of a curtain  In these
are represented that portion of the history commencing with the
establishment of the western empire of  PajajÃ¡ran  and ending with
the destruction of the eastern empire of  MajapÃ¡hit   Of this  by
far the most favourite scenes are found in the popular story of the
adventures between the  MÃ©nak JÃ­ng ga   a chief of  BalambÃ¡ng an   and
DÃ¡mar WÃºlan   the light of the moon   on account of the Princess of
MajapÃ¡hit

The compositions which thus serve as the basis of these popular and
interesting entertainments  comprise the legends from which the account
of the earlier periods of Javan story  detailed in another part of this
work  is principally derived  The most popular and interesting events
and adventures are preserved and related in various compositions
whilst more recent actions and events  which possessed less interest
have fallen into oblivion  The constant exhibition of these plays
in every part of the country  but more particularly in the eastern
districts  has served to keep alive the recollections of  days long
since gone by   and to disseminate a general knowledge of native
legendary history among many  with whom  from the ignorance of letters
the stories might otherwise have been irretrievably lost or more
grossly distorted

The  DÃ¡langs   who manage and conduct these amusements  are treated
with considerable respect  In many points  their office strongly
resembles that of the ancient bards  The ceremony of giving his
blessing to the first born infant  in the repetition of some particular
passages of the ancient legends  gives this part of his office a very
peculiar interest  The usual payment to the  DÃ¡lang  who owns a set of
wÃ¡yangs   and brings his own  gÃ¡melan  players  is from two to three
dollars for the night  but the nobles and chiefs generally have several
sets of  wÃ¡yangs  of their own  and keep a  DÃ¡lang  in their service

Another representation of this nature is that of the adventures of
MÃ©nak Jing ga  and  DÃ¡mar WÃºlan   which are exhibited  but not very
commonly  by means of drawings on folded leaves of strong paper
while the  DÃ¡lang  repeats the story and furnishes dialogue to the
characters  This is termed  wÃ¡yang bÃ©ber   An entertainment of a
similar description  though not accompanied by the exhibition of
figures  is termed  trÃ©bang   it was invented in the time of the
kingdom of  DÃ©mak   The story is taken from the Arabic account of
BegÃ­nda Ambia   which being rendered into Javan  is repeated by the
DÃ¡lang   who with a small drum before him  and accompanied by the
music of the  gÃ¡melun   gives spirit to the different parts  by beating
time with his hand  and varying the strength of the sound or quickness
of time according to the subject  These two latter are of comparatively
modern invention  and not much esteemed

The dance with the Javans  as with Asiatics in general  consists in
graceful attitudes of the body  and in the slow movement of the arms
and legs  particularly of the former  even to the distinct motion of
the hand and fingers

Of the dancing girls who exhibit at public entertainments  the first
in rank and the most skilful in their profession are the concubines of
the sovereign and of the hereditary prince  They alone are allowed to
perform the  s rÃ­mpi   a figure dance by four persons  distinguished by
an unusual degree of grace and decorum

The dancers are decorated according to the ancient costume of the
country  and nearly in the same manner as a modern bride  The  tÃ¡pih
or petticoat  is of silk of different colours  often green stamped
with golden flowers  and hanging in the most graceful manner  a part
of it falling between the feet and serving as a short train  which
in the course of the dance is frequently thrown aside by a quicker
motion of the foot than ordinary  The  Ãºdat   or waistband  is of the
chÃ­ndi  pattern  and on these occasions is worn the  mer   or cestus
composed of plates of gold highly ornamented with diamonds at the
clasp in front  The body is enclosed in a kind of corset   pemÃ¡kak
passing above the bosom and under the arms  and confining the waist
in the narrowest possible limits  The ends of the  sÃ©mbong   or sash
fall gracefully on each side on the back of the hip and reach the
ground  Sometimes  indeed  this graceful appendage to the dress is
brought from the back to a point between the breasts  whence being
fastened in a rosette  the ends flow towards the ground in front of
the person  the usual bending attitude during the dance causing them
to hang distinct from the rest of the apparel  The triple necklace
richly chased armlets  bracelets  and tiara  are of gold  studded
with precious stones  and the hair is gracefully ornamented with buds
of white and sweet scented flowers  On their fingers they generally
display brilliant rings  and the face  neck  shoulders  and arms
which remain uncovered  are tinged by a delicate shade of yellow
powder  The music is slow and solemn  and the performance is on the
gÃ¡melan salÃ©ndro   verses from the romances of  PÃ¡nji   descriptive
of the attire and beauty of the wives and concubines of that hero
being chaunted as a prelude to the entertainment and during its
continuance  On occasions when the  s rÃ­mpi  are exhibited before
Europeans at the Residency house  they are brought with great care  and
under a guard  from the  krÃ¡ton   in a large enclosed palanquin  or
rather box  borne on men s shoulders  When they reach the door of the
residency  they glide behind the prince into the chamber appropriated
for his accommodation  and when they come forth for the dance  seat
themselves on the ground in front of him  On his intimating that they
should commence  they slowly  and to the sound of music  close their
hands  and raising them to the forehead  bend in reverential awe  and
gradually extending their arms and swaying in unison with each other
from side to side  assume an erect posture  The dancers seldom exceed
the age of fourteen or fifteen  The birth of a child generally puts
an end to their performances  and removes them from the profession
They are the choicest beauties of the country  selected for the royal
bed  Throughout the whole performance their eyes are directed modestly
to the ground  and their body and limbs are by slow movements thrown
into every graceful attitude that the most flexible form is capable
of exhibiting  In the figure of the dance they occasionally approach
and recede from each other  and sometimes cross to the opposite side
It frequently happens  that the delicate corset by falling too low
exposes more of the body than is considered correct  On such occasions
one of the trusty matrons always in attendance raises it again  without
interrupting the dance or embarrassing the movements of the dancer
At the conclusion of the dance they gradually place themselves on
the ground  in the same manner as before its commencement  and after
closing their hands  and raising them to the forehead in token of
respect  remain seated with a downcast look and captivating modesty
until the signal is given to the matrons to relieve them by others
when they again glide into the same apartment

The  bedÃ¡ya   who perform a figure dance of eight persons  are in some
respect to the nobles what the  s rÃ­mpi  are to the sovereign  but
at present  few of the nobles can afford to maintain a sufficient
number of youthful concubines to compose this dance  it is frequently
therefore performed by boys trained for the purpose  They are dressed
nearly in the same manner as the  s rÃ­mpi   though not so expensively
The action moves to the same music and song

But the common dancing girls of the country  who appear to approach
more nearly to the usual dancing girls of Western India  are called
rÃ³ng geng   and are generally of easy virtue  They make a profession
of their art  and hire themselves to perform on particular occasions
for the amusement of the chiefs and of the public  Though to be found
in every principal town  their performance is most highly esteemed
in the western  and particularly among the rude mountaineers of
the  SÃºnda  districts  where the superior graces of the  bedÃ¡ya
are unknown  Here they are constantly engaged on every occasion of
festivity  and the regents frequently keep the most accomplished in
their service for years  Their conduct is generally so incorrect  as
to render the title of  rÃ³ng geng  and prostitute synonymous  but it
not unfrequently happens  that after amassing considerable wealth in
the profession  they obtain  on account of their fortune  the hand
of some petty chief  In this case  they generally  after a few years
retirement and domestic quiet  avail themselves of the facility of
a divorce  and repudiating their husbands  return to their former
habits  The  rÃ³ng gengs  accompany the dance with singing  the words
being generally extempore to the music of the  gÃ¡melan salÃ©ndro  and
pÃ©log   Their dress is coarse  but in other respects resembles that of
the more select dancers  They do not  however  wear any tiara on the
head  nor armlets  bracelets are only worn occasionally  Their hair
is dressed after a peculiar fashion  abundantly oiled  and ornamented
with flowers of various kinds  They sometimes exhibit singly and
sometimes in groups  following and approaching each other  or receding
at pleasure  They perform at any time of the day  but chiefly in the
evening  and endeavour to exhibit their best attitudes round a lamp
which hangs suspended  Generally speaking  both their action and their
song are rude and awkward  and on that account often disgusting to
Europeans  although there are some among them whose performance does
not deserve to be so considered  Their action is usually distorted
their greatest excellence seeming to consist in bending the arms and
hands back in an unnatural manner  and giving one or two of the fingers
a tremulous motion  The voice  though sometimes harmonious  is often
loud  dissonant  and harsh to an European ear  They generally have a
handkerchief thrown over the shoulder  and usually a fan in their hand
which occasionally serves to conceal one half of the face  not so much
out of any affectation of bashfulness  as  in the manner of a huntsman
to assist the louder tones of the voice  At other times it is employed
to strike against the back of the arm  so as to give a greater effect
to different parts of the action and music  Generally speaking  the
rÃ³ng gengs  do not descend to the performance of those disgusting and
disgraceful postures and motions  which are stated to be so frequent
on the continent of India  but they are not free from the charge
of impropriety in this respect  Their song  though little esteemed
and less understood by Europeans  sometimes possesses much humour
and drollery  and in adapting their motions to the language  they
frequently excite loud bursts of laughter  and obtain great applause
from the native audience

The nobles of the highest rank are accustomed  on particular occasions
of festivity  to join in the dance with a  rÃ³ng geng   To dance
gracefully  is an accomplishment expected in every Javan of rank
and in the western districts  particularly  all the chiefs are  on
days of festivity  accustomed to join in the exercise  one after the
other  commencing with the youngest  On these occasions  the nobles
of the highest class vie with each other in pointing the toe with
grace  in exhibiting elegance of movement  in displaying adroitness by
intricate evolutions  or beauty of person by an ingenious management
of attitude  So devoted are they to this exercise  that although their
wives and daughters never dance  the happiness of a festive occasion
is considered incomplete  where an opportunity is not afforded to the
chiefs themselves of introducing their favourite amusement  In the
SÃºnda  districts  there are some individuals distinguished as regular
posture or dancing masters

It is not unusual for the performances of the  rÃ³ng gengs  to be varied
by the action of a fool or buffoon  Mimicry is a favourite amusement
and beside imitating  in a ludicrous manner  the actions of the
rÃ³ng gengs   there are not wanting performers of this description
who occasionally direct their wit against all classes of society  and
evince a considerable degree of low humour

These are the only public exhibitions of the female sex  but the
posture dances by the men are numerous  and contribute to the state of
the sovereigns and chiefs  Among these  the  GÃ¡mbuh   with a shield
on one arm  gracefully raises the  dÃ³dot   or petticoat  with the
other hand  the  Niutra   having a bow and arrow in the hand  goes
through the motion of its exercise  stringing and unstringing it to
the sound of the  gÃ¡melan   Both throw their limbs and body into the
most graceful postures  as they slowly move in procession before the
chiefs  or are arranged on the side of the passage through which he
is to pass  Both the  GÃ¡mbuh  and  Niutra  are naked from the waist
upwards  while the  dÃ³dot  hangs to the ground on one side in the
manner of full dress  shewing the knee on the other  Their bodies are
generally covered with yellow powder  and from round their ears hang
suspended in front  strings of the young  melÃ¡ti  flowers

The  GÃ¡mbuh  are occasionally employed to exhibit before the prince
when with a  krÃ­s  in their right hand and a shield on their left arm
they go through all their evolutions to the sound of music

But the chief description of male performers are the  BÃ©ksa kÃ©mbang
or  BÃ©ksa rong geng   who have flowers  shields  or serpents in their
hands  and in dancing seem to resemble the South Sea Islanders  though
more elegant in their attire  and perhaps more graceful in their
motions  Neither have any covering above the waist  but the yellow  and
sometimes green powder which is upon the body  gives it an appearance
very like dress  The term  BÃ©ksa lÃ¡wung  is applied to the petty
chiefs  who on public days dismount from their horses  and go through
the exercise of the spear for the amusement of the prince  Another
description of performers are termed  Unchelang   their art consists in
throwing the spear into the air  and catching it again as it falls with
great dexterity  Similar exhibitions of these persons combating with
sticks  called  Ãºjung   were formerly common

In the domestic circle  the women and elderly people are partial to a
peculiar amusement termed  sintren   which paints very forcibly the
notions they possess of the power of music  A boy or girl  properly
attired and skilled in the dance  is placed under a reversed basket
which is carefully covered with cloth  Round it music and song are
struck up by all present  those who do not play on any instrument
or who do not sing  joining in beating time by clapping their hands
When the excitement has continued sufficiently long to be supposed to
have effected the charm  the basket is seen to move  and the boy or
girl rising from under it  apparently unconscious of what is doing
moves and dances gracefully but wildly  in unison with the music  At
length tired out  the dancer falls and seems to sink into sleep  and
when awakened pretends not to recollect any thing that has passed  The
perfection of this amusement consists in the performer s giving himself
up so completely to the power of music as to be charmed by it  and
perfectly unconscious of every other sense

For the amusement  principally however of children  a cocoa nut shell
is carved with the features of a man  and affixed to the top of a
reversed basket  covered with cloth  This basket  after being for
some time exposed by the side of a river  or under a large tree  in
order  as is supposed  that some supernatural spirit may enter into
it  is brought again into the house  and rocked according to the
swaying motion of the Javan dance by two children  to the music of the
gÃ¡melan   An amusement of this kind is termed  brÃ­ndung

Tilts and tournaments   wÃ¡tang   form a favourite and constant
diversion with the Javans  they are exhibited principally in the  Ã¡lun
Ã¡lun   or great square in front of the  krÃ¡ton   or palace  and compose
an essential part of the ceremony of the  pÃ¡sar senÃ©n   or the day
in which the sovereign and regents appear in public  This  with the
sovereign  is Saturday  with the chiefs  Monday  On the afternoon of
this day  all the princes  nobles  and public officers assemble  and
arranging themselves in the places assigned to their respective ranks
await the coming out of the sovereign  who  as soon as he descends from
the  setÃ­ngel   mounts a horse richly caparisoned  and rides round
the  warÃ­ngen  trees  the several chiefs joining in his suite as he
passes the circle  Several of the chiefs  and particularly their sons
and youthful relations  then join in pairs  tilting and striking their
long and blunted spears as they pass the sovereign  The same thing
is observed on the afternoon of every Monday  at the capitals of the
different provinces throughout the island  where the native government
and institutions are at all preserved  The assemblage of people on
these occasions is frequently very great  The trappings and housings of
the horses are extremely rich  and the riders perform their feats with
some dexterity  being seldom unhorsed 116   At the conclusion of the
exhibition on horseback  it is not unusual for the youths and petty
chiefs who have contended in the saddle to dismount and practice the
attack and defence of the spear on foot  they are then termed  BÃ©ksa
lÃ¡wung   Tilts are likewise exhibited in the  Ã¡lun Ã¡lun  on the days of
public festival  when the chiefs appear

The Javans have long advanced beyond that state in which the chace was
considered as connected with their subsistence

The stag is hunted chiefly in the eastern and western extremities
of the island  by the descendants of the  BÃ¡li  and  SÃºnda  races
the Javans inhabiting the central districts are not practised in the
diversion  nor much acquainted with it  They uniformly pursue the
animal on horseback  In the eastern districts he is killed with a
spear  in the western he is cut down with a  klÃ©wang  or cutlass  here
the chace is conducted with more regularity and method  and many of the
inhabitants  particularly the chiefs  are passionately addicted to it
employing the best and swiftest horses and dogs they can procure for
the purpose

A favourite and national spectacle is the combat between the buffalo
and the tiger  A large cage of  bÃ¡mbu  or wood is erected  the ends of
which are fixed into the ground  in which the buffalo is first and the
tiger afterwards admitted  through openings reserved for the purpose
It seldom fails that the buffalo is triumphant  and one buffalo has
been known to destroy several full grown tigers in succession  In
these combats the buffalo is stimulated by the constant application of
boiling water  which is poured over him from the upper part of the
cage  and of nettles  which are fastened to the end of a stick  and
applied by persons seated in the same quarter  The tiger sometimes
springs upon the buffalo at once  he very generally  however  avoids
the combat  until goaded by sticks and roused by the application of
burning straw  when he moves round the cage  and being gored by the
buffalo  seizes him by the neck  head  or leg  The buffalo is often
dreadfully torn  and seldom survives the combat many days  In these
entertainments the Javans are accustomed to compare the buffalo to the
Javan and the tiger to the European  and it may be readily imagined
with what eagerness they look to the success of the former  The combat
generally lasts from twenty minutes to half an hour  when  if neither
of them is destroyed  the animals are changed  and the tiger  if he
survives  is removed to be destroyed in the manner called  rÃ¡mpog
which is as follows

On receiving information of the retreat of a tiger the male inhabitants
are sometimes called out in a body  by the order of a chief  each
man being obliged to be provided with a spear  the common weapon of
the country  The place where the animal is concealed is surrounded
a double or triple range being formed  according to the number of
hunters  and he is roused by shouts  by the beating of  gongs   or by
fire  The place where he is expected to attempt his escape is carefully
guarded  and he is generally speared on the spot

In many districts  where the population is not deficient  the
appearance of a single  tiger  rouses the neighbourhood  and he is
infallibly destroyed by the method described 117

When the  rÃ¡mpog  is resorted to by way of amusement at the capital of
the sovereign  a hollow square of spearmen  four deep  is formed on
the  Ã¡lun Ã¡lun   in the centre of which are placed the tigers in small
separate cages  or rather traps  with a sliding door  in the manner
of a rat trap  Two or three men  accustomed to the practice  at the
command of the sovereign  proceed into the centre of the square  and
placing plaited leaves in front of the cage  to supply the place of the
wooden door  set it on fire  and drawing the wooden door up  throwing
it on one side  themselves retreating from the spot at a slow pace
to the sound of music  As soon as the tiger feels the fire he starts
and in endeavouring to make his way through the spearmen is generally
received upon their weapons  Instances  however  have occurred  in
which the animal has made good his retreat  but he was soon afterwards
killed  sometimes the tiger  particularly if he has been opposed to the
buffalo  will not move from the centre of the square  in which case the
sovereign generally directs six or eight of his choice men   gÃ¡ndek
to advance towards him with spears  This they do with surprizing
coolness and intrepidity  never failing to pierce the animal  by fixing
their spears into him at once  The smaller species of the tiger is
generally selected for this amusement

The exposure of criminals in combat with tigers was formerly practised
and it is said to have been common on the first establishment of
the  MatÃ¡rem  empire  but of late years  such a method of deriving
amusement from the infliction of judicial punishment had almost become
obsolete  and is now  as well as mutilation and torture  altogether
abolished by treaty  Several instances are said to have occurred
during the reign of the sultan of  YÃºgya kÃ©rta  who was deposed by the
British Government in 1812  In an exhibition of this kind  which took
place about ten years ago  two criminals were exposed for having set
fire to a dwelling  They were provided each with a  krÃ­s   which was
long  but broken off or blunted at the point  and the tiger was let
in upon them separately in a large cage constructed for the purpose
The first was soon destroyed  but the second  after a combat of nearly
two hours  succeeded in killing the tiger  by repeated cuts about the
head and under the ears and eyes  On this a smaller tiger  or rather
leopard  was let in upon him  and the criminal being equally successful
in this combat was released  His success  as in the judicial ordeals
of the dark ages  was taken for a manifestation by heaven of his
innocence  and not only secured his pardon  but procured for him the
rank of a  MÃ¡ntri   as a recompense for the danger to which he was
exposed in its vindication  Although this barbarous practice appears
so recently to have been resorted to  it is not to be inferred that  as
a spectacle  it is held in any estimation by the Javans in general  It
seems to have been of comparatively late introduction  and adopted only
in the policy of a known and avowed tyrant  The concourse of spectators
to witness the combat can no more stamp the general character of the
people with barbarity  than the crowds which are always present at
public executions in Europe  The bare relation of the fact excites
feelings of horror in the mind of the ordinary chief

Bull fighting is common on  MadÃºra  and in the eastern parts of the
island  but it is perfectly different from any species of sport derived
from the courage or ferocity of that animal in Europe  Here  neither
dogs are employed as in England  nor men and horses as in Spain  but
the bulls themselves are directed against each other  The population
form an extensive ring round the  Ã¡lun Ã¡lun   within which the animals
are first led up to a cow  until they are sufficiently excited  when
the cow being withdrawn they are set at liberty and contend with each
other  until one of them gives way  and is driven from within the
ring by the victor  The small well formed bulls of  SÃºmenÃ¡p  afford
considerable amusement in this way  while considerable bets are laid on
the result of the combat

The combat between the ram and wild hog  which generally terminates by
several dogs being let in to complete the destruction of the latter
is an exhibition which furnishes frequent amusement  a small stand is
raised for the ram  to which he can retreat when in danger  and from
whence he can take advantage of a favourable moment of attack upon his
antagonist

Quail fighting   Ã¡duh gemÃ¡r   and cock fighting   Ã¡duh jÃ¡gu   were
formerly very prevalent  the latter particularly  among the common
people  but by no means to the same extent as practised in the other
islands of the Archipelago  in many parts of which  particularly among
the  MalÃ¡yus   it forms almost the whole source of diversion and
interest  On the establishment of the British power  cock fighting and
gaming  which had formerly proved a productive source of revenue to
the European government  were prohibited  and are now in consequence
rarely resorted to  The Javans were not in the habit of fixing spurs to
their cocks  this practice  they say  belongs to the  MalÃ¡yus  118
The common people still amuse themselves with betting upon the issue of
a fight between two crickets   Ã¡dhu jangkrik    which are daily exposed
in the markets for that purpose  The little animals being confined in
small  bÃ¡mbus  partially opened  are said to afford an amusement of
considerable interest

Among the games of skill may be reckoned those of chess  drafts
and several minor games played with pieces or balls  on boards of a
somewhat similar construction

In chess   chÃ¡tur   the pieces are named  the  rÃ¡tu   or king  the
pateh   or minister  corresponding with the queen  two  prÃ¡hu   or
vessels  corresponding with castles  two  mÃ¡ntri   corresponding with
bishops  two  jÃ¡ran   or horses  corresponding with knights  the
bÃ­dak   or pawns  and are arranged as in the English game  except that
the kings are placed on the left hand of the queens  and opposite to
the adversary s queen  The moves are also the same  except that the
king  if he has not been checked  may move two squares the first time
either as a knight or otherwise  and that the pawn may move two squares
the first move  even though it should pass the check of an adversary s
pawn  When a pawn reach the adversary s first line  it must retrograde
three moves diagonally before it can become a queen  except it has
reached the castle s square  in which case it is a queen at once  There
maybe any number of queens on the board at once

The king cannot castle after having been checked  Castling is performed
by two moves  the castle must first be brought up to the king  after
which the king may pass over the castle at any future move  provided he
shall not have been checked  or that no piece has occupied the square
he would move into  A piece or pawn must remain on the board till the
last  if the king is left alone it is considered as  stale mate   and
he wins

This game was formerly more general than at present

Besides chess  there are a variety of games played upon checkers  and
next to it in estimation may be considered the games of  chÃºki  and
dÃ¡kon   In  chÃºki   the board has one hundred and twenty angular
points  formed by cross lines on a checkered board  and the same is
played with sixty white and sixty black pieces  The object here is to
clear the board of the adversary s pieces  and the victor is he who
does so first  The parties toss up who shall take off the first piece
or break the board  The moves are in all directions  and the person who
commences goes on as long as he can take one  three  or five of his
adversary s pieces  When he cannot do either  he stops  and the other
goes on in the same way   DÃ¡kon  is played with fourteen or eighteen
balls on an oblong board with holes  and is much practised by women

DandÃ¡man   or drafts  is not very unlike the Indian game  but has more
pieces

MachÃ¡nan   is a game in which two chief pieces represent tigers  one
conducted by each party  and twenty three pieces representing cows
the tiger who destroys the most wins the game   MÃ¡ling an  is played
on squares with eighteen pieces  and the object is to surround your
adversary s pieces

Of games of chance there are many  That denominated  telÃ¡ga tÃ¡ri  is
accounted the most ancient  it consists in guessing the number of beans
enclosed within the hand  Three or four people commonly join in it  One
of the party having dried beans in his lap  take a certain number in
his hand  requiring each of the others to fix by guess upon a number
if there are three persons  upon a number from one to four  and the two
numbers left fall to the share of the person who holds the beans  If
the number in his hand exceeds four  every four beans are thrown aside
and the residue  until they are reduced to that number or below it
only counted

Dadu   or dice  as well as cards  are borrowed from the Chinese  and
not included among the national games  The most common species of
gaming  and that which is practised by the numerous and dissolute class
of  bÃ¡turs   or porters  in the central districts  is a kind of pitch
and toss  denominated  kÃ©plek   Four farthings  whitened or marked on
one side  are tossed into the air  if the whole or three of them fall
on the side that is marked  or on the reverse  the party who tossed
them wins  if only two he loses the stake

Bets are frequently laid on the hardness or otherwise of a particular
nut  known among the  MalÃ¡yus  by the term  bÃºa kras  and called
Ã¡duh gemÃ­ri   Bets also frequently depend on the flying of kites
 layÃ¡ng an

I shall conclude this chapter by referring to some peculiarities
which  although partially explained elsewhere  and falling perhaps
more correctly under other heads  may not be improperly noticed in an
account of the national usages and customs

The practice of filing and dying the teeth black  and that of
lengthening the lobe of the ear to an enormous size  both of which have
been already noticed  appear to have extended over the whole of the
eastern peninsula of India  as far as China  and throughout the islands
of the Archipelago  as far at least as Papua or New Guinea

The practice of covering the face  body  and limbs with yellow powder
on state occasions  and the use of yellow silk or satin for the
envelope of letters between princes  evinces the same esteem for this
colour which prevails in the other islands  as well as in Ava  Siam
and China

The  krÃ­ses  worn by the Javans are only varieties of that which is
found in the islands  and on what is termed the Malayan peninsula  The
Javans have a tradition that it was first introduced by one of their
early Hindu sovereigns   SakÃº tram   others call him  Sa PÃºtram    who
is said to have come into the world with the krÃ­s by his side  This
krÃ­s is supposed to have been of the kind called  pasopÃ¡ti   which is
consequently considered as the most honourable at the present day  In
the chapter on History will be found an account of the  krÃ­s  deposited
in the tomb of the  SusÃºnan GÃ­ri   and of the virtues attributed to
it by the superstitions of the country  There is a tradition  that
the inhabitants of all those countries in which the  krÃ­s  is now
worn  once acknowledged the authority of the Javans  and derived that
custom from them  Another tradition attributes the introduction of this
weapon among the islanders to the celebrated  PÃ¡nji   The practice of
poisoning the blade of the  krÃ­s  seems to have been attributed to the
Javans and their neighbours without any foundation  In order to bring
out the damasking  it is usual to immerse the blade in lime juice and
a solution of arsenic  which  by eating away and corroding the iron
may probably render the wound more angry and inflamed  and consequently
more difficult to cure  but it has never been considered that death is
the consequence  After this application of the acid and arsenic  the
blade is carefully smeared with some fragrant oil  to prevent it from
rusting  and this is all that is ever done to it

It has been usual to condemn these people as blood thirsty  prone to
immediate revenge  because they invariably use the  deadly krÃ­s   but
however frequent the appeals to this weapon may be in some of the more
wild and uncivilized of the Malayan states  experience has proved to
us  that on Java it may be universally worn without danger  I have
elsewhere remarked  that the custom of wearing the  krÃ­s  among these
islanders has  in its effects upon the manners of the people  proved
in many respects an effectual substitute for duelling among Europeans
In these countries  where there is very little justice to be obtained
from regularly established courts  and where an individual considers
himself justified in taking the law into his own hands accordingly  the
MalÃ¡yu  is always prepared to avenge with his  krÃ­s  the slightest
insult on the spot  but the knowledge that such an immediate appeal
is always at hand  prevents the necessity of its often being resorted
to  an habitual politeness ensues  and it has often been said  that
if the  MalÃ¡yus  are savages  they are by far the most polite savages
that we know of  If this effect is produced on the wilder and less
civilized  MalÃ¡yu   and has equal force with the more adventurous and
warm hearted  BÃºgis   it may be easily conceived the Javans have not
escaped it  The  krÃ­s   among them  has for a long period been more
exclusively a personal ornament  than a rapier was in Europe fifty
years ago  being among the higher classes even seldomer resorted to  as
a weapon of defence or offence  than the latter

The condition of absolute slavery  as understood by Europeans  seems
to have been unknown to the ancient constitution of society in these
islands  and throughout all the fragments of their history  of their
laws  usages  and customs  no trace is to be found of its ever having
existed among the Javans 119

Throughout the more ancient laws and institutions of the country  a
property of the subject in the land is clearly recognized  and it
is probable that it continued to subsist till the subversion of the
Hindu government  From various definitions and enactments respecting
property  some of which may be seen in the  SÃºria Alem  120   it is
obvious  that money transactions took place formerly  to a greater
extent than they do at present  The change is probably attributable to
the European policy of the last two centuries  Four per cent  per month
when a valuable pledge is deposited  and double that amount otherwise
is the common rate of interest in small transactions between the
natives and Chinese of the present day

In the transaction of money concerns  the women are universally
considered superior to the men  and from the common labourer to the
chief of a province  it is usual for the husband to entrust his
pecuniary affairs entirely to his wife  The women alone attend the
markets  and conduct all the business of buying and selling  It is
proverbial to say the Javan men are fools in money concerns

When speaking of their fondness for show and state  I noticed that the
Javans were at the same time distinguished by neatness and cleanliness
qualities not often combined with the former  That they are in most
respects remarkable for their neatness cannot be denied  to their
personal cleanliness there are exceptions  This is however chiefly true
of the higher classes  and especially those who mix with Europeans
but the common Javan  though more cleanly than the Chinese and even
the European  would suffer by a comparison in that particular with the
natives of Western India

The common people generally bathe once a day  others once only in two
or three days  None of any rank anoint the body with grease  as is
the case with the natives of Western India  but they abundantly oil
their hair  which among the common people  on account of its length
is too often filthy in the extreme  They are accustomed to arrange
the hair with a coarse comb  but the use of the small toothed comb is
unknown  its office being invariably performed by the hands of women
Near Batavia  and some of the low capitals on the coast  it is not
unusual to see on the road side women thus employed for the benefit of
passengers  at a certain rate per head  who submit to it as naturally
as an English labourer goes into a barber s shop to be shaved for a
penny  The  MalÃ¡yus  accuse the Javans of eating what they find on
these occasions    Ã­tu Ã³rang JÃ¡wa    say they    mÃ¡kan kÃºtut    This
however  appears to be a calumny  the Javans confess to biting  but
deny the swallowing  The practice of the women cleaning the men s hair
is referred to by the Javans as of very ancient date  It was from this
practice that the mother of  WÃ¡tu GÃºnung   in the very earliest period
of Javan traditionary story  discovered her lost son 121

Passing from this disgusting particular  and referring the reader to
the details of the native history for the leading features of the
political character of the Javan  and to the other divisions of this
work  which may afford him information how to estimate their former and
present state of civilization  I cannot but regret  that I am compelled
to reserve  until a future occasion  a more detailed account of the
constitution  usages  and customs of the village societies  It is by
these that the private virtues and vices of the people are perhaps best
illustrated  and an account of the municipal regulations by which the
little property and happiness of each individual is protected  of the
internal precautions of police  and of the mode of adjusting disputes
could not fail to be interesting  on account of their simplicity
their equity  and efficacy  Independently of the degree of rational
independence and importance which the existence of these societies
insures to the common people  and of the protection which  under all
circumstances of greater political revolutions  they have afforded to
them  it is hoped that their influence in maintaining the police and
tranquillity of the country  will ever prevent the European authority
from interfering in their constitution or internal arrangements

It has long been the opinion of the Dutch authorities  that a system
of European police  and the employment of European officers of police
are necessary  but under the British government the contrary has
been satisfactorily proved  Let the higher departments of justice be
scrupulously superintended and watched by Europeans of character  let
the administration of justice be pure  prompt  and steady  let what
is bad in the native practice of police be gradually removed  but let
the system  in its application to the common people  be supported  It
is one which has grown with them  one which they are accustomed to and
understand  Under the native system  the rice block of the village is
used as the alarm  and according to the manner in which it is beaten
the inhabitants know whether it is to announce a single thief or a
banditti  a tiger or a fire  and arm themselves suitably  As it is
usual for a thief to have but little covering on his body  and to oil
himself all over  that he may slip from the hands of any one who may
seize him  the Javans make use of a long wooden pole  with branches of
brambles inverted within a fork at the end  and by means of this simple
contrivance they avoid the risk of being wounded  and effectually
secure the offender  who cannot escape without tearing his skin
These  and other simple expedients  adopted from immemorial custom and
according to the circumstances of the country  are certainly preferable
to the watchmen s rattles and constables  staves which Europeans would
wish to introduce

Balem bÃ¡ng an   and directed them to proceed to the Prince of DahÃ¡
and to present to him a handsome present  composed of the most
beautiful and rich ornaments and articles of dress for adorning a
princess  placing the same in a  kendÃ¡ga   or box   in order that if
the prince was pleased to allow it to be delivered to his daughter
DÃ©wi ChÃ¡ndra KirÃ¡na   it might be a proof that he confirmed the
contract with  KlÃ¡na JÃ¡yang SÃ¡ri   and that his daughter   DÃ©wi ChÃ¡ndra

ready to attack the enemies of the prince    See the Adventures of the

101  Fortune was so much considered in the making of these matches
among the Romans  that the augurs were always called along with the
witnesses to a marriage contract  to pronounce upon the happy results
of the settlement which the latter attested

Veniet cum signatoribus Auspex     Juvenal



102  The Jews marry in nearly the same way  the husband delivering a
sum of money as a pledge  The Greeks were in the habit of presenting
gifts on similar occasions

103  A description of this instrument  on account of the importance
attached to it among the Javans  the constancy with which it is worn
and the care with which it is preserved through different generations
will be found in another place

104   Non consulum sed maritorum numero annos suos computant
Seneca  de Benef    But this is short of Juvenal s account   Fiunt
octo mariti  quinque per autumnos

105  The Romans likewise were in the habit of washing the dead body
several times before interment with water  which in their case was warm

    Pars calidos latices et ahena undantia flammis
   Expediunt  corpusque lavant frigentis et ungunt

                                 Virgil  Ã†neidos  lib   vi   lin   218

By referring to the Old and New Testament  the same practice will be
found to have prevailed among the Jews  indeed  it seems to have been
very general

106  During the two latter quarters of the moon she is considered as
appearing in the form of a  RasÃ¡ksa   and is then more properly called
DÃºrga

107  A custom somewhat similar to this is said to be practiced in
South America

They lighted a great number of torches  and the midwife taking up the
child carried it through the yard of the house  and placed it upon a
heap of leaves of sword grass  close by a basin of water  which was
prepared in the middle of the yard  and then undressing it said   my
child  the gods  Ometeuctti  and  Omicihautl   Lords of Heaven  have
sent thee to this dismal and calamitous world  receive this water
which is to give thee life   and after wetting its mouth  head  and
breast  with forms similar to the first bathing  she bathed its whole
body  and rubbing every one of its limbs said   where art thou  ill
fortune  in what limb art thou hid  go far from this child      History
of Mexico by Clavigero  translated by Cullen   vol  i

108  It is curious to observe how exactly this corresponds with the
patriarchal history of Scripture  and the early accounts of the manners
of ancient nations  The daughter was always considered the property of
the parent  the wife as the purchase of the husband  and the marriage
contract as the deed of transfer

109  One of the names of PÃ¡ngi

110  The prevalence of this practice must strike every one

111  See Astronomy

112  See Historical Chapters

113  These prayers will be found at length in the Transactions of
the Batavian Society  vol  ix  The word  hong   used by the Javans at
the commencement of their invocations to the deity  is doubtless the
mystical  om   of the Hindus

114  The following are the only traditions respecting these people
which are current in the eastern provinces   The people of the
Teng ger  mountains say  that they received that name from a person
from  MatÃ¡ram   of an inquisitive and travelling turn   wong malÃ¡na
who having ascended the highest of them  and being struck with
astonishment at the view of all around  gave them the above mentioned
name of  Teng ger   from the Javan word  angeng ger   which signifies
wonder or astonishment

Before  GÃºnung BrÃ ma  had received that name  or had become a volcano
there lived a man called  Kiai GÃ©de DÃ¡dap PÃºtih   who had no children
He petitioned of his deity to grant that he might have children  to the
number of twenty five  promising  in that event  that he would cast
away one of them into the sea  In the course of a short time children
began to be born unto him  As soon as he had the number he had prayed
for  the people of  Teng ger  were inflicted with a pestilence  so
dreadful in its effects  that those who were attacked by it in the
morning never failed to die before the evening   DÃ¡dap PÃ¹tih  was so
distressed and afflicted at the lamentable situation of the  Teng ger
people  that he loathed his food and neglected his rest  till it was
communicated to him in a vision  that the pestilence had been sent in
consequence of his having omitted to perform his vow  of casting into
the sea one of the twenty five children whom the deity had granted him
DÃ¡dap PÃºtih  then assembled all his children  and inquired which of
them was willing to be sacrificed  in order to appease the angry deity
All of them signified their unwillingness to become the victim except
the youngest child  who voluntarily came forward and agreed to suffer
in which ever way its father thought proper   DÃ¡dap PÃºtih   however
reflecting that the sea was at a very great distance  carried this
child only to that extensive sand plain at the foot of  GÃºnung BrÃ¡ma
which bears the name of  SagÃ¡ra wÃ©di  or  Lout PÃ¡sir   and there
abandoned it  No sooner had he done so  than  GÃºnung BrÃ¡ma  began to
send forth hollow sounds  and immediately burst forth into a volcano
SagÃ¡ra wÃ©di  is so called from the resemblance of its sandy surface
to a sea when surveyed from  BrÃ¡ma s  heights  its original name is
Dassar

 Bima  being asked by  Kresna  if he was able  in the course of one
night  to make an inland sea below the  Teng ger  mountains  and having
answered in the affirmative   Kresna  challenged him to do it  telling
him at the same time  that it must be done before the cocks were heard
to crow  or the people of the villages began to weave or beat out rice
By three o clock in the morning his work was so far advanced  as to
convince  Kresna  that it would be completed in the prescribed time
To prevent this  therefore   Kresna  immediately went  and rousing
all the cocks and people of the villages  caused the former to crow
and the latter to begin to weave and beat out rice  By this manÅ“uvre
Bima  was obliged to leave off the work  which otherwise would have
been completed within the fixed time  and so incensed was he against
the people  who had so untimely began to weave and beat our their rice
whereby he failed to perform the task which was given to him to prove
his power  that he cursed them  and swore that they should never again
perform either the one act or the other  and to this day the  Teng ger
people neither weave cotton nor beat out rice

115  See History

116  It has already been noticed that the island is plentifully
supplied with a fine breed of small horses  Almost every petty chief
and public officer is mounted  and those who possess the means pride
themselves upon a respectable establishment  They have an aversion to
some colours  and there are particular marks  the possession of which
renders a horse valuable to the natives  if a few hairs on the neck
curl  or have the appearance of a star  the horse is highly prized
Previously to the cession of  KedÃº  to the European government in 1812
the native princes maintained a very respectable stud in that province
Horses are never shod on Java  nor are they secured in the stable
as is usual in Europe and Western India  A separate enclosure is
appropriated for each horse  within which the animal is allowed to move
and turn at pleasure  being otherwise unconfined  These enclosures are
erected at a short distance from each other  and with separate roofs
They are generally raised above the ground  and have a boarded floor

The Javans use an extremely severe bit  and in consequence have the
horse always under command  The saddle  bridle   c  are extremely
heavy  and disproportioned to the size of the animal

117   The fruit of a species of  contorta   called  kÃ¡lak kÃ¡mbing
has a deadly effect on tigers  It is prepared by the admixture of other
vegetables  and exposed on a piece of rag at the places frequented by
them  In some districts their number has been sensibly diminished by
this poison     Horsfield

118  The cocks reared for this purpose are of the large game breed
The cock which we improperly call the Bantam  is not found on Java
except as a curiosity  it comes from Japan

119  A peculiar feature in the state of society in the Eastern Islands
is the law between debtor and creditor  Throughout the Archipelago
where the European government has not interfered  confinement for
debt is unknown  The creditor universally has a right to the effects
of the debtor  to the amount of the debt  on proving it before the
proper authority  and if the effects are not sufficient to satisfy
the demand  he has a right to the personal services of his debtor
and of his debtor s wife and children if necessary  Hence arises that
extensive class of people commonly called slave debtors  or more
correctly bondsmen  In Java they are termed  bÃ©dol   In the provinces
of Java subject to the European authority  this practice has for some
time been checked  and during the administration of Marshal Daendels
in 1810  when it was usual for the common Javans to lend themselves
in pawn for a certain sum of money  it was declared illegal  As an
ancient institution of the country  it will perhaps be better explained
hereafter  in detailing the existing practice on  BÃ¡li   which may be
considered to assimilate  in a great measure  with what the practice
once was on Java

The extensive prevalence of the Javan language  and its connexion
with the languages of continental India  were not overlooked by those
intelligent Europeans who visited these islands at an early period
for we find Valentyn 122  quoting the authority of Flaccourt  who
published in 1661  and the Portuguese Jan de Barros  for conclusions
with regard to the extent of Javan commerce in remote ages  drawn from
the resemblance then traced between the languages of Java and those of
Madagascar and Ambon  Amboina    The Javans   observes this author
must doubtless have visited Coromandel and Malabar  for the high
or court language is  in three parts out of four  derived from the
Sanscrit or Brahminical language  Many Malabar words also enter into
the composition  and it is besides composed in a great measure from the
Dekan   which is the ancient language of India  in the same manner as
the Sanscrit is the sacred language

The alphabet has been exhibited  though imperfectly  by Valentyn
Le Brun  and Reland  and an  Alphabetum Bantemense  is said to have
been found amongst the posthumous papers of the learned Hyde  but
the language does not appear to have been regularly cultivated by
Europeans until within the last very few years  Some of the outlines
of the Javan mythological stories had previously appeared in a Dutch
dress  in the transactions of the Batavian Society  and these  with
the translation of the Lord s Prayer in the high and low languages
published by Valentyn  some short vocabularies  and a short comparative
view of the Javan and Malayan languages  which appeared in a Dutch work
entitled   Begin en vortgang den Oost Ind Compen    or the Rise and
Progress of the East India Company  are the only contributions to our
knowledge of Javan literature with which I am acquainted

The native population of Java   MadÃºra   and  BÃ¡li   islands most
intimately connected with each other in every respect  use exactly
the same written character  and it appears that one generic language
prevails throughout these islands  Of this generic language  however
there are four dialects  differing so materially from each other as to
be generally considered separate languages  It is  however  rather by
admixture of other languages than by mere difference of dialect that
they are distinguished  These dialects or languages are the  SÃºnda
spoken by the inhabitants of the mountainous districts of Java west of
TÃ©gal   the  JÃ¡wa  or Javan  which is the general language of Java
east of ChÃ©ribon  and throughout the districts lying on the northern
coast of the island  the  MadÃºra  and the  BÃ¡li   being the dialects or
languages belonging to those islands respectively

How far these dialects or languages radically assimilate with each
other  and justify the opinion that one generic language prevails
throughout  may be determined by an inspection of the annexed
vocabulary 123   The  Lampung  is added on account of the vicinity of
that part of Sumatra to Java  and the intimate political connection
which at all times subsisted between the people  and in order to
enable the reader to compare them all with the prevailing language of
the Archipelago the  MalÃ¡yu  is prefixed  Under the Javan is included
the  BÃ¡sa krÃ¡ma   or polite language  which will be more particularly
noticed hereafter

In this vocabulary such words only have been introduced as are used
in conversation  and in ordinary epistolary composition  but the
inhabitants of these islands possess further a classic language
altogether distinct from the ordinary languages of the country  and
which is to them what the  Sanscrit  is to the  Pracrit  language of
Hindustan  and what the Pali is to the  Birman  and  Siamese   This
language is termed  KÃ¡wi  124   The annexed vocabulary  No  2 125
which affords a comparison between the  Sanscrit   the  Pali   and the
KÃ¡wi   will shew how nearly these languages are allied

These two vocabularies may serve to convey a notion of the extent
peculiarities  and antiquity of the Javan language  which will be found
as intimately connected with the  MalÃ¡yu   or general language of the
Archipelago  on the one hand  as it is with the  Sanscrit  and  Pali
on the other

The  SÃºnda  language  though now confined to the mountainous districts
seems to have been formerly  and probably down to the period
immediately preceding the revolution occasioned by the Mahomedan
conversion  the general language of the western districts  and is
perhaps the most ancient vernacular language of the country  It is a
simple uncultivated dialect  adapted however to all the purposes of
the simple and uneducated mountaineers who speak it  and has perhaps
escaped the influence of foreign innovation  from the peculiar nature
of the country and the independent character of that race  It possesses
a considerable portion of  MalÃ¡yu  words  and some of Sanscrit origin
the latter being  generally speaking  proper names or terms of art
and science or polity  have probably been borrowed from the eastern
or proper Javans  in common with whom the  SÃºnda  people have adopted
a  B hasa dÃ¡lam   or  BÃ¡sa krÃ¡ma   which  however  is by no means
extensive  The  SÃºnda   with reference to the Javan  may be viewed in
much the same light as the Welch is to the English  The proportion of
the people who now speak it does not exceed one tenth of the population
of the whole island  the remaining nine tenths speak Javan

The language of  MadÃºra   which is again divided into the dialects
of  MadÃºra  proper and  SumenÃ¡p   will be found to contain many words
in common with that of  SÃºnda   but a much more extensive portion of
MalÃ¡yu   varied in the termination by a peculiarity of dialect

The languages of  BÃ¡li  are intimately connected with those of Java and
MadÃºra   In the historical part of this work it will be shewn that it
was in  BÃ¡li  the ancient religion  and with it the literature of Java
took refuge in the fifteenth century of our Ã¦ra  and although  from the
difference which is at this day found to exist between the vernacular
languages of the two countries  as well as in their institutions  it is
evident that the language  literature  and institutions of Java were
there engrafted on a more rude and savage stock  still it is chiefly
to  BÃ¡li  that we must look for illustrations of the ancient state of
the Javans  The relation of the political revolutions by which these
islands have been convulsed at different periods of their history
will  in a great measure  account for the distinctions of language
which at present exist  while  at the same time  these distinctions and
peculiarities must serve to confirm many of the facts  for which we
should otherwise have only the authority of tradition to rely

At Bantam the language is much mixed with  MalÃ¡yu  and  SÃºnda   The
language in ordinary use at Batavia and its immediate vicinity is a
jargon of Dutch  Portuguese  Chinese  Javan  and  MalÃ¡yu   the latter
forming the principal component  In  BÃ³gor  and  Chai Ã¡njur   the
SÃºnda  is pronounced in a more drawling manner than in  ChÃ©ribon
where it is probably most correctly spoken  as in the word  nÃ¡h
what  which at ChÃ©ribon is pronounced short and sharp   naÃ¹   At
TÃ©gal  the Javan words are in like manner lengthened in pronunciation
while at  SemÃ¡rang  they are spoken short and full  At the courts of
Sura kÃ©rta  and  Yugya kÃ©rta   the words are pronounced short  strong
and full  In the provinces east of  SurabÃ¡ya   the language partakes
much of the  Madurese   and in the extreme district of  BanyuwÃ¡ngÃ­
the  BÃ¡li  is discernible

The alphabet of Java is peculiar  it consists of twenty consonants   y
and  w  are of the number   termed  aksÃ¡ra  or letters  In common with
all other characters properly Indian  these letters may be considered
as syllables  composed of a consonant and an inherent vowel sound
which is invariably expressed  unless contradicted by a particular sign

Besides the  aksÃ¡ra   there are twenty auxiliary characters  termed
pasÃ¡ng an   which in this application means corresponding or similar
They have the same power as the  aksÃ¡ra  against which they stand
except that they are only used in connexion with and immediately after
the  aksÃ¡ra   for the purpose of suppressing their inherent vowel
sound  Three of them are always placed after the  aksÃ¡ra   the others
below them

When the inherent vowel sound in the  aksÃ¡ra  is not contradicted
the  aksÃ¡ra  is termed  lagÃ¡na   The vowel sound in this case is that
of  a  in  water   or of  o  in  homo   the  o  being at present
invariably used at the native courts and their vicinity for the
inherent vowel of the consonant  instead of  a   The latter  however
is still preserved on  MadÃºra    BÃ¡li   and in the districts of Java
west of  TÃ©gal   and was doubtless the original inherent vowel  The
consonant sounds correspond with the sounds usually attributed to the
English consonants  with the exception of a second  d  and  t   which
correspond with similar sounds in the  DevanÃ¡gari  alphabet   ch
which is used as  ch  in  church    nia   and  ng    which latter is
frequently used as an initial letter

Besides these there are five vowel signs  which supplant the inherent
vowel  These signs are termed  sandÃ¡ng an   the clothing or dress  The
rÃ©pa  consist of certain contractions of consonants and other signs
used in composition  These  with a  pÃ¡ngkun   or sign of elision
corresponding with the  bÃ¡ris mÃ¡ti  of the  Malayu   which has no
sound of its own  but being placed at the end of a word or sentence
denotes its termination in a pure consonant  and some few other marks
corresponding with the  DevanÃ¡gari   complete the orthographical
arrangement  which though complex and intricate  is remarkable for its
precision

Some of the letters occasionally occur under a capital  or rather
peculiar form  for they are of the same size  but these are seldom
used  and when they are  it is not as capitals are employed in European
languages  They are principally found in proper names  and titles of
office  and are placed alike in the beginning  middle  or end of a
word

The annexed table is intended to exhibit the powers and application of
the different letters and orthographical signs  No  1  exhibits the
characters now in general use  No  2  contains the square characters
in which the  KÃ¡wi  is usually written  and in which the different
inscriptions in that language  cut in stone and copper  are found
No  3  contains specimens of the varieties which the alphabetical
characters have at different times assumed  arranged  according to
the judgment of the native writers  in the order of their relative
antiquity

The Javans write from left to right  Every consonant   aksÃ¡ra   is
written separately  not being joined to that which precedes it  and no
space is left between the words  One or two short diagonal lines are
used at the close of every poetical stanza  and sometimes a comma  and
this is the only mark in the language which simply indicates a stop

In Java the natives usually write with Indian ink upon paper
manufactured by themselves  as already described  and sometimes on
European and Chinese paper  but in  BÃ¡li  the natives invariably use an
iron style  and cut the letters on a prepared palm leaf  in the same
manner as in Western India  This practice is still partially continued
in some of the more eastern parts of Java  and was no doubt  at a
former period of their history  general throughout the island  The leaf
is called  lÃ³ntar   from  ron  a leaf  and  tal  the palm tree  the
first and last letters being transposed   and the leaves or manuscripts
are strung together to form books in the same manner as on continental
India  Of these I have several specimens  containing nearly all the
interesting compositions of the country

As in the  MalÃ¡yu   by far the greater proportion of primitive Javan
words are dissyllables  pronounced with a slight stress or accent on
the former of the two  There are a great number of derivative words
formed after the same manner as those in the  MalÃ¡yu   by prefixing or
annexing certain inseparable and otherwise non significant particles
Compound words  formed by the junction of two or more significant
terms  are frequently met with  though they by no means form an
extensive portion of the language

Many words  in their primitive sense  are not confined to one
particular part of speech  but are common to two or more  Nouns  as
in the  MalÃ¡yu   cannot be said to possess the distinctions of either
gender  number  or case  The males and females of all animals are  with
few exceptions  as in the instances  PÃºtra    PÃºtri    DÃ©wa    DÃ©wi
BramÃ¡na    BramÃ¡ni   and some few others  denoted by adding to the
general terms words applicable to the different sexes  Number is not
denoted by any variety of termination or change in the form of the
noun  but by separate words  expressive of plurality or singularity  a
duplication of the singular sometimes occurs  though rarely  to denote
plurality  Where the terms  bÃ­ji    Ã©kor    buÃ¡h    kÃ©ping    c  are
used in the  MalÃ¡yu  to specify a particular number  the term  wÃ­ji  is
used indiscriminately in the Javan  whatever may be the thing spoken
of  The nouns have no cases

The adjectives are indeclinable  and generally follow the noun  and
these are sometimes formed from nouns by prefixing a particle  The
comparative degree is sometimes formed by prefixing a word meaning
higher or larger  but more frequently by placing adverbs  significant
of  with   before that with which the comparison is made  as if we
should say  by the side of   The superlative degree is formed by
annexing adverbs signifying  very  exceedingly  entirely  alone

The cardinal numbers are placed sometimes before and sometimes
after the nouns to which they are attached  When prefixed  they
undergo  for the sake of the sound  a variety in their termination
or drop the first syllable  The ordinals are formed by prefixing a
distinguishing word to the cardinals  Ten characters  which are all
either alphabetical letters or signs slightly altered in form  serve to
express all numbers  the notation being decimal  and the numerals being
combined in the same manner as the Indian and Arabian

The pronouns of the first and second person are always significant  and
vary with the relative rank of the parties  There is no proper pronoun
of the third person  but a word signifying  alone  self   with the
addition of the possessive particle  is used as a personal pronoun of
the third person  The personal pronouns may all be used as possessive
pronouns  by being placed as such after the noun to which they belong
The relative and demonstrative pronouns correspond very nearly with
those of the  MalÃ¡yu

With regard to the verb  it may be noticed that many of the
observations in Mr  Marsden s grammar  on the nature and formation of
the different parts of the  MalÃ¡yu  verb  are applicable to the Javan
It belongs rather to the detail of the grammar to point out these
but it may be remarked  that the use of these inflexions in the Javan
appears to be so varied and undefined  that it is impossible  without
a much more extensive knowledge of the language than Europeans at
present possess  to make out a perfect conjugation  or to lay down any
fixed rules for them  All that could perhaps be done  in the present
state of the language and of our knowledge of it  would be to give a
number and variety of correct idiomatical expressions in the Javan
by which their nature and irregularity may be shewn  and our present
limits do not admit of this

The Javan language has never been reduced within the grammatical rules
adopted by Europeans  nor have the Javans themselves any notion of
grammar  The construction is generally simple and regular  but owing
to prosodial refinements  every writing of importance being written
in verse   syllables and words necessary to express a perfect sense
are often omitted  at other times  unnecessary syllables or words
are added  and letters at the beginning  middle  and end of a word
are transposed  Hence  and also from the usual ellipsis of the verb
transitive and personal pronouns  the meaning of many passages appears
obscure

The language is remarkable for the profusion of words which it
contains  for the minute distinctions and shades of meaning  and the
consequent extent of synonymes  and for difference of dialect

Of the profusion of words it may be observed  that the Javan  in this
respect  may be put in competition with many of the more cultivated
languages of Europe and Asia  and that a dictionary would perhaps be
far from complete  if it comprehended less than twenty thousand

Of the extent of synonymes  and the minute shades of distinction which
are found in this language  some notion may be formed from the extracts
from the  DÃ¡sa NÃ¡ma  which are annexed 126   In order to facilitate
the acquirement of the language  it is usual to collect all the words
in the different dialects  with their synonymes  and to connect them
together by stringing them in classes following each other  according
to the natural chain of our ideas  Thus  after commencing with the
word  man   and giving an explanation of every word in the vernacular
polite and  KÃ¡wi  languages  applicable from his birth to his death
as  infant    boy    youth   and the like  it proceeds to  woman
child   from thence to the deities  afterwards to the various
avocations of mankind   c  This collection of synonymes is called
DÃ¡sa NÃ¡ma   literally the  ten names   a term probably given to it on
account of few important words in the language having less than ten
synonymes  Children are no sooner taught to know the letters of the
alphabet  which they first describe on the sand   and to connect them
in syllables and words  than they are instructed in the  DÃ¡sa NÃ¡ma
without a partial knowledge of which  no youth is considered competent
to enter upon any public office  or can advance to a knowledge of
the written compositions of the country  These collections are
varied in their contents and order of arrangement  according to the
acquirements and notions of the compiler  As books of reference they
may be considered to supply the place of dictionaries  and if less
convenient for this purpose than works alphabetically arranged  they
have certainty an advantage over them  in the comparative facility with
which their contents are impressed on the memory

But there is no feature in the language more deserving of notice than
the difference of dialect  or the distinction between the common
language  and what may be termed the polite language or language of
honour  The latter contains many words of Sanscrit origin  and a
portion of  MalÃ¡yu   and in those instances in which it appears to
have been borrowed from the vernacular language  which may perhaps
be loosely estimated at a fourth of the whole  a slight alteration
is commonly made in the orthography and pronunciation  to mark the
distinction  To render this distinction intelligible to those who
are not locally informed  it may be necessary to explain  that from
whatever cause the distinction may have originated  so clearly is
the line drawn on Java  between the higher and the lower classes of
society  that on no account is any one  of whatever rank  allowed
to address his superior in the common or vernacular language of the
country  This language is exclusively applied when addressing an
inferior  or among the lower orders or uneducated  where distinction
of rank may not be acknowledged  Persons of high and equal rank  when
discoursing among themselves  sometimes use the polite language  but in
general they adopt a medium  by introducing words belonging to both
branches of the language  and this is generally adopted by them in
epistolary correspondence

It is probable  that in the earlier stages of society  the terms of
respect used towards a superior were comparatively few  that this
second dialect  which now forms so extensive a branch of the general
language  has been gradually formed with the growth of arbitrary power
and that  at one period  the extent of these terms did not exceed what
is to be at this day found in the less cultivated dialects  and among
the more independent races of  MadÃºra  and  SÃºnda   Such  however
is their present extent in the Javan  that nearly one half of the
words in the vernacular language  have their corresponding term in
the  BÃ¡sa KrÃ¡ma  or polite language  without a knowledge of which no
one dare address a superior  and although the general construction
of the language  and its grammatical principles are not altered  so
effectually is the language of inferiority contrasted with that of
superiority  that it is possible to suppose a case in which a person
might be well acquainted with one dialect  without being able to
understand one sentence of the other

It is not  however  to be inferred  that the one is studied and
attained exclusively of the other  for while the one is the language
of address  the other must be that of reply  and the knowledge of both
is indispensable to those who have to communicate with persons of a
different rank with themselves  Children are accustomed from their
infancy to employ the polite language in addressing their parents and
relations  and this added to the mode of instruction by the  DÃ¡sa NÃ¡ma
above described  early impresses upon their memory the corresponding
terms to be used according to the occasion  The  BÃ¡sa KrÃ¡ma   as has
been before noticed  consists of a more extensive class of foreign
words  and where different words from the common language have not been
introduced  a variation in the orthography and termination is adopted
and the more effectually to render it distinct  not only are the
affirmatives and negatives  as well as the pronouns and prepositions
varied  but the auxiliary verbs and particles are different

I have already mentioned  that besides the ordinary and the polite
languages of the country  the inhabitants of these Islands possess a
poetic or classic language  called  KÃ¡wi   In this are written all the
historical and poetical compositions of note  as well as most of the
ancient inscriptions on stone and copper  which are found in different
parts of the Island  In a short vocabulary already referred to 127
the relation of the  KÃ¡wi  to the SÃ¡nscrit and  PÃ¡li  is shewn  and in
order to enable the SÃ¡nscrit scholar to extend the comparison  I have
annexed a further vocabulary of  KÃ¡wi  words  with the meaning which
the Javans at present attach to them 128

At what period this language was introduced into Java  whence it
came  and whether it was ever the sacred or vernacular language of
any foreign people  remains to be decided  Of the words of which it
is composed  as far as we may judge from the annexed vocabulary  and
the compositions which have come down to us  nine out of ten are of
SÃ¡nscrit origin  and less corrupted than the present  PÃ¡li  of  Siam
and  Ava  appears to be  if  therefore  it was ever the same language
with the  PÃ¡li   it must have been before the  PÃ¡li  was corrupted  and
therefore probably at a very remote period

In  BÃ¡li  the  KÃ¡wi  is still the language of religion and law  in
Java it is only that of poetry and ancient fable  In the former
the knowledge of it is almost exclusively confined to the  BramÃ¡na
Bramins   in the latter  a slight knowledge of it is deemed essential
for every man of condition  In  BÃ¡li   the ancient  mythological  and
historical poems  are however preserved in more correct  KÃ¡wi  than
on Java  and it is to the copies obtained from thence  that reference
will be principally made in the observations which follow on Javan
literature

In noticing  the accessary tongues from whence the  MalÃ¡yan  acquired
such a degree of improvement  as removed it from the general level
of the other cognate dialects  and gave it a decided predominance in
that part of the east   Mr  Marsden observes   that the earliest  as
well as most important of these  appears to have been  either directly
or mediately  that great parent of Indian languages  the  Sanscrit
whose influence is found to have pervaded the whole of the eastern
and perhaps also of the western  world  modifying and regenerating
even where it did not create  That the intercourse  whatever its
circumstances may have been  which produced this advantageous effect
must have taken place at an early period  is to be inferred  not
only from the deep obscurity in which it is involved  but also from
the nature of the terms borrowed  being such as the progress of
civilization must soon have rendered necessary  expressing the feelings
of the mind  the most obvious moral ideas  the simplest objects of the
understanding  and those ordinary modes of thought which result from
the social habits of mankind  whilst  at the same time  it is not to
be understood  as some have presumed to be the case  that the affinity
between these languages is radical  or that the latter is indebted to
any Hindu dialect for its names for the common objects of sense 129

The same observations apply still more extensively to the Javan  and
in the  KÃ¡wi  or classic language  we may presume to have discovered
the channel by which the Javan received its principal store of Sanscrit
words  for it is the practice  even at present  among the better
educated of the Javans  for the party to display his reading  by the
introduction  particularly into epistolary correspondence and literary
compositions  of  KÃ¡wi  words  by which means the colloquial  but more
particularly the written language of the country  is daily receiving
fresh accessions of Sanscrit terms  From the vocabularies now presented
to the public  and the account which will be given of their literary
compositions  it will appear  that few languages  even on the continent
of India  have been more indebted to the Sanscrit than the Javan  One
original language seems  in a very remote period  to have pervaded the
whole Archipelago  and to have spread  perhaps with the population
towards Madagascar on one side  and to the islands in the South Sea on
the other  but in the proportion that we find any of these tribes more
highly advanced in the arts of civilized life than others  in nearly
the same proportion do we find the language enriched by a corresponding
accession of Sanscrit terms  directing us at once to the source whence
civilization flowed towards these regions  At what period  however  the
light first broke in upon them  or at what period the intercourse first
took place between the enlightened inhabitants of Western Asia and the
islanders of this extensive Archipelago  is a question which  perhaps
may be more properly discussed  when treating of the antiquities and
history of the country  and at best is involved in so much obscurity
and fable  that much must be left to conjecture

The letters of the Javan alphabet  as well as the orthographical
signs  are decidedly on the principle of the  DevanÃ¡gari   but it is
remarkable  that the letters of the alphabet do not follow the same
order  notwithstanding that order is preserved in all the alphabets
of Sumatra as well as in that of Celebes  This deviation has been
considered presumptive of the alphabet having been introduced into
the island anterior to the period when this order might have been
established for the  DevanÃ¡gari  itself  or before the refinement
supposed to have been effected in that alphabet by the Bramins  but
the deviation may  perhaps  be sufficiently accounted for  by the
circumstance of a meaning being attached to the words formed by the
order of the Javan alphabet as the letters are at present arranged
thus   hÃ¡na charÃ¡ka dÃ¡ta sawÃ¡la pÃ¡da jayÃ¡nia mÃ¡ga batÃ¡ng a   means
there were two messengers disputing with each other  equally
courageous  till they both died 130    That this is not accidental may
be inferred  not only from the common laws of chance  but from the
probability of such an arrangement being preferred  both on account
of its convenience  and in conformity with the spirit which in the
ChÃ¡ndra SangkÃ¡la  seeks to select such expressions for the particular
numerals that are required  as may make a sentence

Near the ruins of  BrambÃ¡nan  and  SÃ­nga sÃ¡ri   are still found
inscriptions in the pure  DevÃ¡nÃ¡gari  character of a very ancient
form  A specimen of these  together with one of the square  KÃ¡wi   is
exhibited in the accompanying plate  corresponding in size with the
original  Annexed to each letter in the  DevanÃ¡gari  character found on
Java  is the modern character  and in the same manner the modern Javan
letters are placed under the  KÃ¡wi   and  in order to enable the reader
to compare the forms of the consonants used in the alphabets of Ava
Siam  and Java  with the  DevanÃ¡gari   they have been placed against
each other in another plate  It will be seen that many of the letters
of the  KÃ¡wi  correspond so exactly with the square  PÃ¡li  of the
Birmans  as to leave no doubt of their having originally been the same
It is probable  also  that were our acquaintance with the  PÃ¡li  more
extensive  a similar coincidence would be found between the languages

Upon the overthrow of the Hindu empire on Java  the natives may
be considered to have lost most of their knowledge of the  KÃ¡wi
language  for although numerous compositions in it are still to be
found among them  and these compositions are recited in their national
entertainments  they would not be generally understood  but for the
versions which have long since been rendered of them into the modern
Javan  The  PanambakÃ¡n  of  Sumenap  is perhaps  at present  alone
entitled to be considered as a  KÃ¡wi  scholar  and he knows so little
of the language as to acknowledge  while assisting in translating from
it  that he was often under the necessity of guessing at the meaning

The knowledge of the ancient characters seems  on Java  to have been
for many years almost exclusively confined to the family of this
chief  and it is stated  that they owe their knowledge of it  and of
the  KÃ¡wi  language itself  to the circumstance of one of them having
visited  BÃ¡li   to which island it is that we must now look as the
chief depositary of what remains of the literature and science which
once existed on Java

It is not unusual for the Javans  in carrying on any secret or
political correspondence  to adopt a mystical language  known only
to the parties themselves  and on occasions where attempts have been
made to stir up the common people to commotion  scrolls have been
distributed in various unintelligible characters  which  for the most
part  appear to have had no other object but to impose on the credulity
of those who were too willing to believe them sacred and mysterious
Were the characters intelligible  the mystery would cease  and the
charm be dispelled  Of the manner in which the letters of the alphabet
are applied in forming this mystical language  an instance is given at
the conclusion of the vocabulary of  KÃ¡wi  words 131

Unlike the Malayan  the Javan language owes little or nothing to
the Arabic  except a few terms connected with government  religion
and science  which have been admitted with the religion and laws of
Mahomet  The language  as well as the ancient institutions of the
country  have been but little affected by the conversion  The Javan
language was abundantly copious before the introduction of Arabic
literature  and had few or no deficiencies to be supplied

The general character of the language is strongly indicative of a
former advanced state of civilization  and illustrates  in some degree
the present character of the people  It is rich and refined  it abounds
in synonymes and nice distinctions  it is mixed and easily made to
bend  and suit itself to every occasion  it is  in a high degree
expressive of power and servility 132

As the languages of the whole Archipelago are so intimately connected
with each other  and that of Celebes in particular is so little known
I have subjoined in an Appendix some further comparative vocabularies
of the languages of Java  with some observations on the  BÃºgis  and
MangkÃ¡sar  nations 133

For ordinary purposes  the Javans  as already described  use a
modification of some of the letters of their alphabet as numerals  and
a representation of these numerals has been given in the table of the
Javan alphabet  page 404  but on occasions of importance  it is usual
to employ certain signs or symbols in lieu of these ordinary numerals
and this practice appears to be of great antiquity among them  These
symbols are termed  chÃ¡ndra sangkÃ¡la    reflections of royal times
or  the light of royal dates   and consist in a certain number of
objects   c  either represented in design or named  each of which is
significant of one of the ten numerals  Of the former class are said
to be those found in most of the ancient buildings and coins  which in
that case usually bear no inscription  The latter is found in most of
the ancient inscriptions  and in such of the written compositions as
possess any date at all  and is adopted in all proclamations and public
writings by the sovereign of the present day

The Appendix G  contains an account of these peculiar numerals  as far
as they are at present understood by the Javans  In the use of them
they endeavour to select such objects from the list  as when read in
succession  may afford some meaning illustrative of the fact the date
of which is recorded  but this is not always attended to  or at least
is not always to be traced  The date of the destruction of  MajapÃ hit
1400   the most important in the history of Java  is stated as
follows  the numbers being always reversed

  SÃ­rna       Ã­lang      kertÃ¡ning        BÃºmi
 Lost and  gone is the  work  pride   of the land
    0           0            4             1

In like manner  the date of the long graves at  GrÃ©sik   near the tomb
of the Princess of  Chermai   1313   is thus stated

   KÃ¡ya      wÃºlan     pÃºtri       Ã­ku
 Like unto  the moon  was that  Princess
     3         1         3          1

Other examples will be given  in detailing some of the principal events
of Javan history

However imperfect the foregoing general account of the languages of
Java may be  it will have served to convey to the reader some notion
of the extent to which it has been indebted to a foreign source for
its copiousness and refinement  and to prepare him for that extensive
influence of Hindu literature  which is still to be found in the
compositions of the country  Of these the most important  and indeed
all that have any claim to literary distinction  are found either in
the  KÃ¡wi  or in Javan versions from that classic language  On Java the
establishment of a Mahomedan government for nearly four centuries  has
tended in a great measure to obliterate that general knowledge among
the better educated  which  there is reason to believe  once existed
but in  BÃ¡li   the Hindu faith  however blended with the local customs
of the island  and however perverted and distorted in its application
by a semi barbarous people  is still the established religion of the
country  Mahomedanism has gained but little ground there  and no part
of the island has yet submitted to European authority  It was in this
conveniently situated island that the adherents to that faith took
refuge  when the sword of Mahomed prevailed on Java  carrying with
them such remnants of the sciences and literature as they were able to
rescue from the general wreck

An account of the present state of the island of  BÃ¡li   of the
religious and political institutions  and of some of the peculiar
customs and usages which subsist there  is essential to the
illustration of Javan history  and although the limits of the present
volume will not admit of our enlarging so much on this interesting
subject as we could wish  it is hoped that a general notion may be
formed  from the particulars which will be inserted in the chapter on
the religion and antiquities of Java  In the following account of the
literary compositions of Java  I shall avail myself of the more correct
copies  which I was fortunate enough to obtain from  BÃ¡li   confining
myself in the explanation of them to the existing notions of the best
informed of the Javans  it being the present state of their literature
rather than that of  BÃ¡li   that I am now to describe

The literature of Java may be considered under the general heads of
ancient and modern  the former and more important division consisting
of compositions in the  KÃ¡wi  language  which appear connected with the
mythology and fabulous history of continental India

It is to be regretted  that the work which treats most extensively of
the ancient mythology of the country  and of the earliest periods of
fabulous history to which the Javans of the present day refer  is not
to be found in the  KÃ¡wi   The Javan work  termed  KÃ¡nda   is probably
a translation from the  KÃ¡wi   and  in the absence of the original
claims our first attention  It is to this work  and the  MÃ¡nek MÃ³yo
of which an abstract will be given in the chapter on religion  that
the modern Javans constantly refer for an explanation of their ancient
mythology

This composition is frequently called  PepÃ¡kam   It contains the
notions of mythology which appear to have been general throughout
the Eastern Islands  with imperfect portions of their astronomical
divisions  and of ancient history  It is to be regretted  however
that the Javan copy from which the following account is taken  though
otherwise written in a very correct style  abounds in passages unfit
for a chaste ear  and that it has been almost impossible entirely to
purify it

It opens with an account  first of  SÃ¡ng yÃ¡ng WÃ©nang   the most
powerful   who was sixth in descent from  PurwÃ¡ning Jan   the first of
men  or Adam   and who had a son named  SÃ¡ng yÃ¡ng TÃºng gal   the great
and only one   the first  who  as is inferred from the meaning of his
name  conceived that he was above all  and who setting aside the ways
of his father  established the heavens  with all that they contain
under the name of  SurÃ©ndra BuÃ¡na   or  SuralÃ¡ya

Plucking a leaf from the  kastÃºba  tree  and paying adoration to it
the leaf assumed the form of a beautiful woman  by whom he had four
sons   1   SÃ¡ng yÃ¡ng PÃºgu   2   SÃ¡ng yÃ¡ng PÃºng gung   3   SÃ¡ng yÃ¡ng
SÃ¡mba   4   SÃ¡ng yÃ¡ng Pang at   When these children attained maturity
PÃºgu  quarrelled with  PÃºng gung   on account of the splendour and
riches of the dwelling of  SÃ¡ng yÃ¡ng TÃºng gal   which each of them
desired to possess   SÃ¡ng yÃ¡ng TÃºng gal  became enraged at this  not
being able to reconcile them  the heavens became disturbed  he  in
consequence  seized hold of both of them   PÃºgu  by the right and
PÃºng gung  by the left hand  and cast them aside  To the former
who fell on  SÃ¡brang   the opposite coast   he gave the name of
SÃ©cha TÃºng gÃ¡ra   to the latter  who fell on Java  he gave that of
NÃ¡yan taka   the same with  SÃ©mar   the attendant on  ArjÃºna    He
converted them into monstrous figures  ridiculous in appearance and
speech  exciting laughter by their actions  and with an inclination to
follow in attendance on warriors

SÃ¡ng yÃ¡ng Tung gal   who is said to have been invisible  and who in
the  WÃ¡yangs  of the present day is designated by a sun or glory of
light  transferred the government of heaven to his son   SÃ¡ng yÃ¡ng
SÃ¡mba   directing him not to separate from his remaining brother  whose
assistance he would require  and conferring upon him the title of  NÃ­la
KÃ¡nta   blue necked   on account of his being of bright appearance  but
having a tinge of blue on the front of his throat  To  Pang at   his
brother  he gave the name of  KanÃ­ka pÃºtra

SrÃ­ NÃ­la KÃ¡nta  subsequently assumed various names and titles  the
most pre eminent of which was  PramÃ©sti GÃºru   by which name and title
he is acknowledged as supreme throughout the Eastern Islands  This
title was first conferred upon him when the deities in  SaralÃ¡ya  were
numerous  and when all looked up to him as an instructor or  GÃºru
KanÃ­ka PÃºtra  took the name of  RÃ©si NarÃ¡da

The thoughts of  SÃ¡ng yÃ¡ng GÃºru  turning one day upon women  he took
a leaf of the  kastÃºba  tree  and paying adoration to it  it was
immediately converted into a most beautiful female  who took the
name of  Uma   While she was young he looked upon her as a daughter
but when she arrived at maturity  he felt a stronger passion   Uma
disliking this fled  and  SÃ¡ng yÃ¡ng GÃºru  being unable to catch her  it
occurred to him that he might be more successful if he employed four
hands and arms  whereupon  at his desire  two additional arms sprang
from his shoulders  and  Uma  was immediately within his embrace  But
she still resisted his desires  and during the struggle  KÃ¡ma SÃ¡la  and
MÃ¡ha PralÃ¡ya   both  RasÃ¡ksas   but the latter in the form of a man
were produced  by an event similar to that which gave birth to some
of the children of Jupiter 134    SÃ¡ng yÃ¡ng GÃºru  still observing the
repulsive conduct of  Uma   said to her   your appearance is like that
of a  RasÃ¡ksa    whereupon she immediately assumed the form of one
and grieving sorely at this transformation  beseeched that she might
again become what she had been  but  SÃ¡ng yÃ¡ng GÃºru  was deaf to her
entreaties  and he conferred upon her the name of  KÃ¡li DÃºrga

KÃ¡ma SÃ¡la  and  MÃ¡ha PralÃ¡ya   when they arrived at maturity  mutually
sought from each other to discover their descent  but not succeeding
they agreed to proceed in company to SuralÃ¡ya  to demand information
from  SÃ¡ng yÃ¡ng GÃºru   resolving that  if they were not satisfied with
his reply  they would make war against him  Arrived at  SuralÃ¡ya
they overcome the opposition of  RÃ©si NarÃ¡da   and reach the presence
of  SÃ¡ng yÃ¡ng GÃºru   who informs them that they are not his children
though they sprang from his body  and that it was the fault of the
woman only that they had their present form  He tells them that he
cannot allow them to remain in  SuralÃ¡ya   but will provide for them a
place in which with their mother they may reside  He then appoints the
mother to be sovereign of  NarÃ¡ka  TambrÃ¡ka mÃºka    under the title of
YÃ¡ma DipÃ¡ti   To  KÃ¡ma SÃ¡la  he gives the title of  BatÃ¡ra KÃ¡la   the
other retained the name of  MÃ¡ha PralÃ¡ya   To  KÃ¡la  he assigns the
charge of the bridge between earth and heaven  called  Wot Ã¡gal Ã¡gil
the tremulous or swinging bridge  over which a good man may pass in
safety  but from which  on account of its being shaken by his sins  a
bad man falls into the gulph below   and to  MÃ¡ha PralÃ¡ya  that of the
souls of men when they die  in order that he may direct to the bridge
such as  from good conduct on earth  have a chance of passing it  and
cast the others into  NarÃ¡ka   to his mother  YÃ¡ma DipÃ¡ti

SÃ¡ng yÃ¡ng GÃºru  was again inclined to take another leaf of the
kastÃºba  tree  but apprehending that it might turn out as before  he
restrained his inclination  Then purifying himself  there appeared
before him  at his desire  a beautiful boy  to whom he gave the name
of  SÃ¡mbu   and after five more purifications  there successively
appeared  secondly  a boy of a high colour  beautiful and very
powerful  to whom he gave the name of  BrÃ¡ma   thirdly  a boy
appearing extremely powerful and enraged  to whom he gave the name of
MÃ¡ha dÃ©wa   fourthly  a boy beautifully white  bright  and fierce
looking  and having sharp and sparkling eyes  to whom he gave the name
of  BasÃºki   fifthly  a boy of a deep black colour  but extremely
beautiful  to whom he gave the name of  WÃ­snu   Vishnu   sixthly  a
girl of a bright yellow colour  beautiful and slender  to whom he gave
the name of  WarsÃ­ki

RÃ©si NarÃ¡da  135  following the example of his superior  there
appeared before him after several purifications  five boys  The first
was brilliant and bright as a pure flame  on him  SÃ¡ng yÃ¡ng GÃºru
conferred the name of  SÃºria   The second was very weak and delicate
but well formed and beautiful  he received the name of  In dra   The
third was short and strong  and was named  SÃ¡kra   or  ChÃ¡kra    The
fourth was of a blue colour  and looking as if he would grow to a great
height  with curled hair like a  PapÃºa  136   on him  was conferred
the name of  BÃ¡yu   The fifth was most beautiful  but appeared sad and
sorrowful  to him  SÃ¡ng yÃ¡ng GÃºru  gave the name of  ChÃ¡ndra

This effected   SÃ¡ng yÃ¡ng GÃºru  considered that a sufficient number of
deities had been created for the charge of  SuralÃ¡ya

SÃ¡ng yÃ¡ng GÃºru  then turned his amorous thoughts towards  WarsÃ­ki
but all the deities opposing it   RÃ©si NarÃ¡da  advises him to take
a woman from the earth  and offers himself to go in search of one
This being agreed to   NarÃ¡da  descends upon the earth  and discovers
a most beautiful virgin  not yet arrived at maturity  at a place
called  MÃ¡dang    SÃ¡ng yÃ¡ng GÃºru  no sooner beheld her than he became
enamoured of her  and giving the name of  Sri   he places her under the
charge of  BatÃ¡ra SÃ¡kra   with especial injunctions to take care of
her  When she arrived at maturity she became most beautiful  and it so
happens that  BatÃ¡ra WÃ­snu  beholds her by accident  they immediately
feel a mutual passion  and  WÃ­snu  obtains his desire  When  SÃ¡ng
yÃ¡ng GÃºru  hears of it  he becomes highly enraged   BatÃ¡ra WÃ­snu  is
cast out from  SuralÃ¡ya  and thrown upon the earth  at a place called
WarÃ­ngen pÃ­tu   or seven banyan trees

Here the narrative breaks off  and the story of  WÃ¡tu GÃºnung
commences as follows

There was a woman of the name of  SÃ­nta   who resided on the earth
and who had a younger sister named  LÃ¡ndap    SÃ­nta  dreamt one night
that she was sleeping with a  PandÃ­ta   named  RÃ©si GÃ¡na   after a few
months she felt herself pregnant  and at the expiration of nine she was
delivered of a most beautiful boy  This child  however  soon became
unruly  and it happened that one day  when he had enraged his mother
excessively  she struck him on the head with the wooden spoon which was
in the rice vessel  on which he fled into the woods  and afterwards
becoming a devotee  his mother long searched for him in vain

At length having concluded his penance  he wandered about in quest of
subsistence  until he came to the country of  GÃ­ling WÃ©si   where he
sought alms at a feast  but not being satisfied with the provision
afforded to him  the parties became enraged  and hostilities ensuing
the Raja of the country was slain  and this boy succeeded him  under
the title of  RÃ¡ja SÃ©la PerwÃ¡ta   which in the common language is
the same as  WÃ¡tu GÃºnung   a name conferred upon him from his having
rested on a mountain like a stone  and obtained his strength and power
thereby  without other aid or assistance

Becoming a great and powerful sovereign  he was still unmarried when
his mother and sister arrived in the country  Ignorant who they were
and admiring their beauty  he espoused them both  and by his mother
SÃ­nta  had twenty seven children  when being one day restless and
anxious to sleep  he requested her to comb and scratch his head  in
doing which she discovered the wound and recognized her son  Her grief
became excessive  and explaining the circumstance to him  she urged him
to obtain another wife from among the  WidadÃ¡ri  of  SuralÃ¡ya   and
recommended  Sri  as a proper object of his choice

WÃ¡tu GÃºnung  thereupon sent an embassy to  SuralÃ¡ya   but the gods
opposing his desires  because  Sri  had been delivered of a child
by  WÃ­snu   he assembled his forces and nearly defeated those of
SuralÃ¡ya   when  NarÃ¡da  pointing out the danger to  SÃ¡ng yÃ¡ng GÃºru
urged the advantage that would arise from the recal of  Wisnu
NarÃ¡da  was accordingly authorized to call him back  with a promise
that if he should be victorious on the present occasion  he should be
pardoned  and permitted to return to his former abode in  SuralÃ¡ya
WÃ­snu  was no sooner engaged in the cause  than he formed a stratagem
with  WilÃºwuh   a demon  RasÃ¡ksa   with whom he had become intimate
at  WarÃ­ngen pÃ­tu   and directed him to proceed to the sleeping place
of  WÃ­tu GÃºnung   in order to ascertain his secret  This spy had
no sooner concealed himself in a place where he could overhear the
conversation that was going on  than he heard the following discourse
between  WÃ¡tu GÃºnung  and  SÃ­nta

SÃ­nta    What think you  shall we be successful or not in this
enterprise

WÃ¡tu GÃºnung    If the gods are so nearly destroyed by those who are
subordinate to me  what must they not suffer when I go myself  for I
shall not then have occasion to use force  I need only say a few words
and if they don t understand the meaning of them  they will forthwith
be destroyed  and I shall myself become sovereign of  SuralÃ¡ya   Should
they  however  comprehend the meaning of what I say  then I shall know
that my power is gone  but still there will be trouble in putting me to
death

SÃ­nta    Tell me what are the words you mean to use  and why they have
not the power to put you to death

WÃ¡tu GÃºnung    I shall enclose in my hand the  SÃ¡stra  or description
of my country  and holding it out  demand of them to tell me what it
is  Then I shall repeat these words   dÃ¡ka wÃ³i dÃ­ki   and also  dÃ­ki
wÃ³i dÃ¡ka   The meaning of these words is easy enough  but the gods
don t understand it  a great tree has small fruit  great fruit has a
small tree  The great tree with small fruit means the  warÃ­ngin  tree
the great fruit and small tree means the gourd  I am invulnerable by
all weapons  but if they pull my two arms asunder  then will they find
it easy to put me to death  but this the gods know not

With this intelligence the spy immediately hastened to  WÃ­snu
who arrived at  SuralÃ¡ya  when the gods were nearly beaten by the
twenty seven sons of  WÃ¡tu GÃºnung   After this success   WÃ¡tu GÃºnung
approaching  SÃ¡ng yÃ¡ng GÃºru   put the intended questions to him  The
latter referring to  WÃ­snu   they were immediately recognized by him
on which  WÃ¡tu GÃºnung  attempted to escape  but was soon overtaken by
WÃ­snu   who laying hold of one of his arms  while his son   Sri GÃ¡ti
held the other  they soon succeeded in putting him to death  As he
expired a voice was heard by  WÃ­snu   saying   think not that it will
end here  hereafter trouble will again arise in  SuralÃ¡ya   in the time
of  RÃ¡ja SumÃ¡li   of the country of  SÃ©la grÃ­ng ging   who will have a
brother named  Mang liÃ¡wan   Forget it not

When the twenty seven sons of  WÃ¡tu GÃºnung  heard of their father s
fate  they wished to sacrifice themselves  but  WÃ­snu  disposed of them
as follows  saying   let there be a sign to the world of this victory
I will once in seven days put to death one of these twenty seven
so that they may be killed in rotation   The grief of  SÃ­nta  being
excessive  she wept for seven days  and afterwards was received into
SuralÃ¡ya   and  WÃ­snu  added her name  as well as those of her sister
and  WÃ¡tu GÃºnung   to the twenty seven  and established the thirty
wÃºku   as everlasting signs  in commemoration of this victory  From
the grief of  SÃ­nta  for seven days  it is said that rain always falls
during the  wÃºku  which bears her name 137

Then seizing the  PepÃ¡teh  and three assistants  who with  WÃ¡tu GÃºnung
had constituted the council of five  he declared that they should serve
to commemorate the four great revolutions or  NÃ¡ga   serpents    NÃ¡ga
BÃºmÃ­   of the earth    NÃ¡ga DÃ­na   of the day    NÃ¡ga WÃºlan   of the
moon    NÃ¡ga TÃ¡hun   of the year   He struck out both the eyes of  NÃ¡ga
BÃºmi   that the earth might never again see to attack the heavens  and
afterwards the left eye of  NÃ¡ga DÃ­na   and the right eye of  NÃ¡ga
WÃºlan

Here that part of the relation which has an astronomical reference
breaks off

BrÃ¡ma  then following the example of  NarÃ¡da   purifies himself  and
at his desire  first there appears before him a boy of strong make
on whom he confers the name of  BrÃ¡ma TÃ¡ma   secondly  a boy  also of
strong make  whom he names  BrÃ¡ma SudÃ¡rga   and thirdly  a beautiful
girl  on whom he confers the name of  BramÃ¡ni WÃ¡ti

The two boys  when they attained maturity  descended from  SuralÃ¡ga
BrÃ¡ma SudÃ¡rga  united in marriage with a female of the earth
from them  in the third degree  were descended  Raja SumÃ¡li  and
MangliÃ¡wan   In the reign of the latter of these a destructive war is
stated to have taken place   MangliÃ¡wan  laid waste  SuralÃ¡ya  and slew
Sri GÃ¡ti   but afterwards  when he shewed a desire to possess  Sri
WÃ­snu  exerted all his strength  and put him to death  As  MangliÃ¡wan
expired  WÃ­snu  heard a voice saying unto him   The work is not
yet complete  hereafter  when there shall be on earth a man named
RahwÃ¡na   who will be descended from  BrÃ¡ma TÃ¡ma   beware of him  in
his time the peace of heaven will be again disturbed  and he will lay
it waste    BrÃ¡ma TÃ¡ma  espoused a princess of  ChÃ¡mpa   named  S rÃ¡ti
DÃ©wi   by whom he had a son  named  BrÃ¡ma RÃ¡ja   who became  Raja
of  IndrapÃºri   and had a son named  ChÃ­tra BahÃ¡r  or  AngsÃ¡rwa   to
whom  when he became advanced in age  he delivered over charge of the
country  proceeding himself into the forests as a devotee  and assuming
the name of  RÃ©si TÃ¡ma

SumÃ¡li  had a daughter  named  SukÃ©si DÃ©wi   This prince  alarmed at
the accounts of  MangliÃ¡wan s  death  fled with her to  ChÃ­tra BahÃ¡r
and requested him to protect her as a maiden  giving him authority
to sanction her marriage on any proper occasion which might offer
He himself fearing the vengeance of  SÃ¡ng yÃ¡ng GÃºru   fled further
into the woods for concealment  but died on the way   ChÃ­tra BahÃ¡r
forgetting the nature of his charge  became enamoured of the girl  This
happened when he was performing a penance  for he had two sons  named
MÃ­sra WÃ¡rna  and  BÃ­sa WÃ¡rna   to the former of whom he had intrusted
the charge of his government  The girl resisted on account of his age
but he at last succeeded  During the first amour he received from her
nine strokes on the head with a stone  In due time she became pregnant
and was delivered of a boy  having nine marks or excrescences on his
head  which added to his natural face  making as it were ten fronts to
his head  he was thence called  DÃ¡sa mÃºka   ten faced   In the second
attempt she pulled the lobes of both his ears with great strength  and
when delivered she produced a child in the form of a  RasÃ¡ksa   and
having immense lobes to the ears  this child was named  Amba kÃ¡rna
or long eared  In the third she scratched him all over  and the fruit
of it was a girl  born with long nails and claws at the end of each
finger  she was named  SÃ¡rpa kanÃ¡ka   or serpent nailed  the wounds
inflicted by these nails are said to have been mortal  But the fourth
being unresisted  she was delivered of a most beautiful boy  who
having a countenance and mouth beautiful like those of a girl  was
named  BibisÃ¡na

When these children were grown up  ChÃ­tra BahÃ¡r  carried them to
MÃ­sra WÃ¡rna   saying   these are your brothers and sister  assist
them  and they will be of use to you in your government    MÃ­sra
WÃ¡rna  had a great dread of thunder  He possessed a weapon called
lÃ­mpung   which descended to him from  BrÃ¡ma RÃ¡ja   and  DÃ¡sa MÃºka
desirous of possessing it  ingratiated himself into his favour  but no
sooner obtained possession of it than he formed a design against his
brother s life  in the hope of succeeding him  He accordingly performed
a penance and prayed for thunder  and as soon as it was heard he slew
his brother  and gave out that he disappeared during the thunder  At
the moment  however  that he struck  MÃ­sra WÃ¡rna  with the weapon it
vanished  still he became Raja

In the mean time  BÃ­sa WÃ¡rna  became beloved by the gods  and they
presented to him a car  named  jaladÃ¡ra   in which he could be conveyed
through the clouds  When  DÃ¡sa MÃºka  heard of this he became enraged
and demanded the carriage for himself  but he had no sooner made the
request than he perceived his lost weapon descend upon the lap of  BÃ­sa
WÃ¡rna   Still more enraged at this  the altercation did not cease
until  BÃ­sa WÃ¡rna   with one blow  laid him senseless on the ground
at which moment the father   ChÃ­tra BahÃ¡r   coming up  he succeeded in
reconciling them  and with impressing upon  DÃ¡sa MÃºka  the futility
of his attempts against his brother   ChÃ­tra BahÃ¡r  on this occasion
repeated several invocations to the deity  which were treasured up in
the recollection of after ages  such as  Hong  AwÃ­gna  Hong  WidadÃ¡nia
Hong  WidadÃ¡ni    c

The father  however  had no sooner withdrawn  than  DÃ¡sa MÃºka  again
took courage  and another combat ensued  which ended in his being a
second time struck senseless on the ground  blood issuing from his
mouth   BÃ­sa WÃ¡rna  then laying hold of his body was about to cut his
throat with the  limpung   when  RÃ©si NarÃ¡da  appeared and arrested his
hand  saying   forbear   SÃ¡ng yÃ¡ng GÃºru  does not permit that you slay
your brother  By attending to this advice you will hereafter become
a deity in heaven  Give your weapon to your brother  who is Raja of
IndrapÃºri     Bisa WÃ¡rna  assenting   RÃ©si NarÃ¡da  then brought  DÃ¡sa
MÃºka  to his senses  and delivering over to him the weapon and car
conferred upon him the name of  Rah wÃ¡na  138   from his blood having
flowed in such quantity as to reach the adjoining forest

In some copies of this work it is said that  DÃ¡sa MÃºka  was called
RahwÃ¡na   because in his youth he delighted in the destruction of
children and to spill their blood  There is also some variation in
this part of the story  and  CitrÃ¡ BahÃ¡r  is termed  ChÃ¡tor BÃ³ja
four shouldered   on account of the great strength he exhibited in the
war with  NÃ­li KewÃ¡cha

RÃ©si NarÃ¡da  then presented  RahwÃ¡na  to  SÃ¡ng yÃ¡ng GÃºru   who taking
a liking to him adopted him as his son  giving him a  salÃ©ndang  139
as a mark of his affection   RahwÃ¡na   however  was soon dazzled by
the appearance of a bright flame  when forgetting the attachment of
SÃ¡ng yÃ¡ng GÃºru   he pursued it  until he came into the presence of
Sri   from whose beauty it proceeded  She  however  ran to her husband
WÃ­snu  for succour  and a severe combat ensued  during which the
heavens were disturbed  and many of its most valuable contents were
destroyed by  RahwÃ¡na    RÃ©si NarÃ¡da  at length approaching  separated
the combatants  saying   this is not the proper place for your
contention  better had you descend to the earth  As for you   WÃ­snu
as you are a god  and may be ashamed to shew yourself as such on earth
it is the will of  SÃ¡ng yÃ¡ng GÃºru  that you be permitted to appear
there in the form of a man  and to do there as you like   On which
RahwÃ¡na  was cast out of  SuralÃ¡ya   and  WÃ­snu   with his consort
Sri   disappeared  without any one knowing whither they went

BÃ­sa WÃ¡rna  was then  in fulfilment of the promise given by  NarÃ¡da
called up to heaven  to supply the place among the  DÃ©was  vacated by
WÃ­snu   and approaching the presence of  SÃ¡ng yÃ¡ng GÃºru  received from
him the name of  BatÃ¡ra AsmÃ¡ra  or  KamajÃ¡ya   the god of love   and
presented him with a consort  named  KÃ¡ma RÃ¡ti  or  BatÃ¡ri RÃ¡ti

Here ends the  KÃ©rta Yoga   or first age of the world  and the  TrÃ©ta
YÃ³ga   or second age  commences

WÃ­snu   after his descent upon the earth  first became incarnate in
the person of an illustrious sovereign  named  ArjÃºna WijÃ¡ya   of the
country of  MauspÃ¡ti   and reigned for a period of seventeen years
during which he was successful in two wars  One  in which the  RÃ¡ja
of  TÃ¡njung pÃºra   having a beautiful daughter  named  ChÃ­tra WÃ¡ti
in whom  Sri  had become incarnate  offered her in marriage to the
prince who should overcome in wrestling all the others assembled
ArjÃºna WijÃ¡ya   however  carried her off from the place in which
she was secreted   GedÃ³ng BrahÃ¡la   which produced a war  wherein he
was victorious  The other war was with  RahwÃ¡na   who attacked him
at  MauspÃ¡ti   in this  RahwÃ¡na  was taken prisoner and confined in
a cage  but on the solicitations of his father   ChÃ­tra BahÃ¡r   he
was forgiven  and allowed to return to his country  on condition that
neither he nor his descendants would ever again make war on  ArjÃºna
WijÃ¡ya

WÃ­snu  afterwards quitting the body of  ArjÃºna WijÃ¡ya  became
incarnate in the person of  RÃ¡ma   son of  DÃ¡sa RÃ¡ta   who when
young was called  MurdÃ¡ka    entering the body of his mother during
conception  and coming into the world with the child  About the
same time  BatÃ¡ra BasÃºki   who had a son named  BaswÃ¡rat   united
to  BramÃ¡ni WÃ¡ti   becoming sorrowful  quitted  SuralÃ¡ya   with a
determination to follow the fortunes of  Wisnu   who after quitting the
body of  ArjÃºna WijÃ¡ya  roamed for some time round the skirts of the
earth until he fell in with  BasÃºki    Wisnu  then said to him   there
is a  Raja  of  MÃ¡ndra pÃºra   named  BÃ¡sa RÃ¡ta   who has two wives
named  DÃ©wi RÃ¡gu  and  MÃ¡nwa dÃ¡ri   I am younger than you  but on earth
I must be older  I will enter the body of  RÃ¡gu   and become incarnate
in the child she will bring forth  do you the same with the other
MÃ¡nwa dÃ¡ri  was delivered of a child named  LakasamÃ¡na   in which
BasÃºki  accordingly became incarnate

The portion of the work  which also includes a relation of the feats
of  BÃ¡li  son of  GotÃ¡ma   the founder of  AstÃ­no   brings the story
down to the period of the poem of  RÃ¡ma   The history is then carried
on to the period of the  PendÃ¡wa LÃ­ma  or  BrÃ¡ta Yudha   and may be
concisely stated as follows

BaswÃ¡rat   son of  BasÃºki   had by  BramÃ¡ni WÃ¡ti  two sons
MÃ¡nu ManÃ¡ra  and  MÃ¡nu MadÃ©wa   The daughter of  MÃ¡nu MadÃ©wa   named
SirÃ¡ti   was married to  BramÃ¡na RÃ¡ja   and from this marriage
proceeded  RahwÃ¡na   The  PendÃ¡wa LÃ­ma  were tenth in descent from
MÃ¡nu ManÃ¡ra   as in the following pedigree

 1   MÃ¡nu ManÃ¡sa
 2   Tritrushta
 3   ParikÃ©na
 4   SutÃ¡pa
 5   Sa pÃºtram
 6   SÃ¡kri
 7   PulasÃ¡ra
 8   AbiÃ¡sa
 9   PÃ¡ndu dÃ©wa NÃ¡ta

The  TrÃ©ta YÃ³ga  or second age  is supposed to have ended  and the
DuapÃ¡ra YÃ³ga   or third age  to have commenced on the death of  RÃ¡ma
which happened about the time of  SÃ¡kri

The  WiwÃ¡ha kÃ¡wi  is a regular poem  and contains three hundred and
fifty five  pÃ¡da   or metrical stanzas  The subject is as follows

Erang BÃ¡yu  had a son  whose form was that of a  RasÃ¡ksa   and who
became sovereign of the country of  Ima Ã­mantÃ¡ka   under the name of
DÃ©tia KÃ©wÃ¡cha   The father  desirous of getting rid of him  urged him
to go to  SurÃ©ndra BuÃ¡na   in search of a flower  called  TurÃ¡ng ga
jÃ¡ti   which was worn by all the  WidadÃ¡ris   The  RasÃ¡ksa  accordingly
goes in search of it  and no sooner comes into the presence of  BatÃ¡ra
GÃºru   than a  WidadÃ¡ri  sitting by his side  named  Su PrÃ¡ba   the
daughter of  BatÃ¡ra SÃ¡mba   presents one of these flowers to him  with
which he returns to his father  who alarmed at his success  immediately
delivers over to him the government of his country

After  DÃ©tia KÃ©wÃ¡cha  had thus become sovereign  he desired to be
united in marriage with the  WidadÃ¡ri  who had given him the flower
and dispatches a  RasÃ¡ksa  named  KolÃ¡ngkÃ­a   with a letter addressed
to  BatÃ¡ra GÃºru   soliciting  Su PrÃ¡ba  in marriage  and threatening
to destroy the heavens in case of refusal  When the messenger reached
SurÃ©ndra BuÃ¡na  he presented the letter to  BatÃ¡ra SÃ¡kra   who knowing
its contents without reading it  immediately replied in a rage   then
let your sovereign carry his threat into execution  for  BitÃ¡ra GÃºru
will never consent that a  WidadÃ¡ri  be married to a  RasÃ¡ksa

When the messenger had disappeared   BatÃ¡ra SÃ¡kra  communicated to the
gods the state of affairs  on which  BatÃ¡ra GÃºru  became enraged  As
he curbed his passion   NarÃ¡ka  becomes disturbed  smoke issued from
its deepest recesses and the heavens rocked to and fro   RÃ©si NarÃ¡da
then apprised  BatÃ¡ra GÃºru  that there was a man on the earth  named
BagÃ¡wan WardinÃ­ngsih   or  MitarÃ¡ga   who had long performed his
devotions on the mountain  Indra kÃ­la   and suggested that it might be
better to employ him against  Detia KewÃ¡cha  than for the gods  who
were ignorant of the art of war  to await in heaven the coming of the
RasÃ¡ksa    BatÃ¡ra GÃºru  approves of the suggestion  and  RÃ©si NarÃ¡da
descends accordingly to  Indra kÃ­la   accompanied by seven  WidadÃ¡ris
in the hope that by the influence of their charms  he might succeed
in abstracting  WardinÃ­ngsih  from the severe penance which he was
performing  The names of the  WidadÃ¡ris  who accompanied him were  Su
PrÃ¡ba    WilotÃ¡ma    Leng leng Mandana    SumartÃ¡ka    Ang impuni    Su
PrÃ¡ba sini   and  DÃ©rsa nÃ¡la   In their train followed a thousand of
the young and beautiful maids of heaven

WardinÃ­ngsih  was performing a long and rigid penance  for the purpose
of recovering the kingdom of  AstÃ­na   and when  NarÃ¡da  arrived
at  Indra kÃ­la   the sun had climbed half way up the heavens  The
WidadÃ¡ris  immediately displayed their charms  and employed every
artifice to attract his attention  but they could not succeed  One of
them  who resembled his wife  even threw off her upper garments  and
exposing her bosom embraced him with transport  but it did not avail

BatÃ¡ra SÃ¡kra  then descended to  Indra kÃ­la   in the disguise
of a Dervise  assuming the name of  PanjÃ­ngrum   and approaching
WardinÃ­ngsih   as if in grief  threw off his disguise  and resuming
the god  addressed  WardinÃ­ngsih  as follows   My visit to you is on
three accounts  first  I request your assistance in this war  secondly
I wish to apprise you  that  BatÃ¡ra GÃºru  will in a short time appear
to you  thirdly  to advise you  that when you see  BatÃ¡ra GÃºru   and
he asks you whether you have courage to engage in the war or not  you
answer that you have  requesting  however  in return  that when the
war  BrÃ¡ta YÃºdha  takes place  the  PandÃ¡wa  may be successful  You
may then request two arrows  called  paso pÃ¡ti  and  trisula   and
the crown  chÃ¡ping basunÃ¡nda   the vest  Ã¡nta kasÃºma   the slippers
mÃ¡rdu kachÃ¡rma   these slippers  when you wear them  will enable you
to fly  and to enter heaven in person  Request  moreover  the chariot
mÃ¡nik   which is drawn by elephants and horses of the heavenly
race   sambrÃ¡ni    and called  chÃ­pta walÃ¡ha   and that if you are
successful in the war with  DÃ©tia KewÃ¡cha    BatÃ¡ra GÃºru   as well as
the other gods  may each present you with a  WidadÃ¡ri     BatÃ¡ra SÃ¡kra
having made an impression on the mind of  WardinÃ­ngsih  returned to
heaven

In the mean time  Mang mÃ¡ng MÃºrka   the  PeptÃ¡eh  of  DÃ©tia KewÃ¡cha
who had a face like a hog  received orders to lay waste the mountain
of  Indra KÃ­la   He no sooner arrived there  and began to destroy the
cultivation  than  SÃ©mar  gave information of it to  WardinÃ­ngsih   who
coming forth with his bow and arrow  immediately struck the  RasÃ¡ksa
upon which  BatÃ¡ra GÃºru  appeared in the form of a forester  holding in
his hand a bow without an arrow  Then straggling with  WardinÃ­ngsih
to withdraw the arrow with which the  RasÃ¡ksa  had been struck  each
pulled at it ineffectually until a quarrel ensued  in which  BatÃ¡ra
GÃºru  accused  WardinÃ­ngsih  of having a bad heart  and of following
the dictates of his  GÃºru DÃºrna   who was at  Astina   and who had
a crooked nose and mouth   WardinÃ­ngsih  being enraged at this  a
severe combat ensued  when  BatÃ¡ra GÃºru  having laid hold of his
adversary s hair  the other attempted to retaliate  on which  BatÃ¡ra
GÃºru  vanished  A fragrant odour immediately arose  and  WardinÃ­ngsih
reflected upon what  SÃ¡kra  had told him  and instantly perceived a
bright arch  like the rainbow  with  BatÃ¡ra GÃºru  appearing within
it  attended by  RÃ©si NarÃ¡da  and a suite of  WidadÃ¡ris   bowing
profoundly to the ground  he felt himself permitted to approach the
deity and kiss his feet   BatÃ¡ra GÃºru  then informed him of his object
in coming to  Indra kÃ­la   and requested that he would make war upon
DÃ©tia KewÃ¡cha   who was the enemy of the gods  to which  WardinÃ­ngsih
consented  making the requests which had been suggested by  BatÃ¡ra
SÃ¡kra   To these  BatÃ¡ra GÃºru  assented  adding   If you have success
in this war  I will appoint you sovereign of the heavens for one year
You shall have power over all the gods  and the  WidadÃ¡ris  shall be
your attendants  and as long as you live you shall have power to visit
SuralÃ¡ya  at your pleasure   This said   BatÃ¡ra GÃºru  disappeared

On the next day  WardinÃ­ngsih  prepared for his journey to  Ima
imantÃ¡ka   the country of  DÃ©tia KewÃ¡cha   and on his way thither fell
in with the  WidadÃ¡ris    Su PrÃ¡ba  and  WilÃ¡ TÃ¡ma   who had been sent
by  BatÃ¡ra SÃ¡kra    WardinÃ­ngsih   on his arrival at the  RasÃ¡ksa s
capital  commissioned these  WidadÃ¡ris  to enter the palace and feign
an attachment for  DÃ©tia KewÃ¡cha    DÃ©tia KewÃ¡cha  no sooner beheld
them  than being thrown off his guard  he declared  that the object of
the war being thus attained without trouble  he would enjoy himself at
his ease  Then dressing himself in his princely robes  and perfuming
himself as a bridegroom  he approached  Su PrÃ¡ba   and taking her
on his knee chaunted a song  which so delighted her that she fell
asleep   WardinÃ­ngsih   on this  entered into her ear stud  and awoke
her   Detia KewÃ¡cha  then urged her to gratify his passion  but she
refused  and required  as a mark of confidence  that he would trust
her with the secret of his power  This he refused  until she was about
to stab herself  when he whispered in her ear that he was invulnerable
except within his throat  if any one injured that part in the least he
must instantly die   WardinÃ­ngsih  thus ascertaining his vulnerable
point  escaped with the  WidadÃ¡ris   and ascended to  BatÃ¡ra SÃ¡kra  in
SuralÃ¡ya

DÃ©tia KewÃ¡cha   then collecting his forces  proceeded to the war with
a countless host  laying waste the country  until he arrived near
TÃ¡nda WÃ¡ru   where he halted to make preparations for the attack  The
heavens now shook  and  NarÃ¡ka  emitted smoke  The gods trembled with
fear  and the wind  charged with the gross stench of the  RasÃ¡ksa
almost overpowered them

WardinÃ­ngsih  having arrived at the abode of  SÃ¡kra   the great bell
 gatÃ­ta   was struck  when the gods immediately assembled  The forces
of  SuralÃ¡ya  then moved on   WardinÃ­ngsih  following in a splendid
chariot  Having thrown off the  PandÃ­ta s  garment  he now appeared
richly clothed in the character of  ArjÃºna   adorned with gold and
costly gems  The chariot had formerly belonged to  RÃ¡ma   and had been
preserved by  BatÃ¡ra GÃºru   when  RÃ¡ma  committed himself to the flames

The battle commenced  and the forces of the  RasÃ¡ksa  being most
numerous and powerful  were about to carry all before them  when  Gatot
KÃ¡cha  arrived  and taking part with  WardinÃ­ngsih   turned the tide
of the battle in favour of the gods  plucking up the mountains by the
roots  and casting them upon the  RasÃ¡ksas    DÃ©tia KewÃ¡cha  escaping
the general overthrow  and attended by  SÃ©cha Tung gÃ¡ra   shot an arrow
at  WardinÃ­ngsih   which the latter caught under his arm  and feigning
death  fell to the ground  Great was the grief of  SÃ©mar  and of all
his other attendants  but  DÃ©tia KewÃ¡cha  approaching burst out into
a loud laugh  when  WardinÃ­ngsih   who had watched his opportunity
observing the  RasÃ¡ksa s  mouth open  instantly rose  and struck the
arrow into it  and so killed him

GÃ¡tot KÃ¡cha   who  in consequence of the absence of  ArjÃºna  on
a penance for three years  had been sent to recall him  and who
had discovered him by the appearance of his attendant  SÃ©mar   now
approached  WardinÃ­ngsih   and kissing his feet  informed him of
the sorrow of  SÃ©na  and  DÃ©rma WÃ¡ngsa  at his absence  on which
WardinÃ­ngsih  desired him to return and report what he had seen

He then proceeded  attended by the victorious host  to the dwelling of
BatÃ¡ra GÃºru   called  PapÃ¡riwÃ¡rna   on which  BatÃ¡ra GÃºru  assembling
the gods  and permitting  WardinÃ­ngsih  to approach and kiss his feet
declares to him that he was not forgetful of his promise  and would
forthwith fulfil it  He then declared him sovereign of  SuralÃ¡ya
under the title  PrÃ¡bu AnÃ­li KÃ­ti   and gave him free access to every
part of the heavens   ArjÃºnÃ¡  then visited the seven quarters of
SuralÃ¡ya   in which was the abode of the  WidadÃ¡ris   and assumed the
sovereignty accordingly  while  Gatot KÃ¡cha   proceeding to  AmÃ©rta
informed  SÃ©na  and  DÃ©rma WÃ¡ngsa  of what had passed  There were also
present at his relation  NakÃ³la Sa dÃ©wa    BatÃ¡ra KrÃ©sna    SÃ¡mbu
and  PanchawÃ¡la   all equally anxious to know the fate of  ArjÃºna
DÃ©wi KÃºnti   the mother of  PandÃ¡wa   having calculated on the death
of  ArjÃºna   and made preparation for burning herself in consequence
was overjoyed at this unexpected good news  and  DÃ©rma WÃ¡ngsa   the
sovereign  AmÃ©rta   gave a grand entertainment  in which the  BedÃ¡yas
danced to the sound of the music  while  GÃ tot KÃ¡cha  related the feats
of  ArjÃºna

The  RÃ¡ma KÃ¡wi  is usually divided into four parts  The first  called
RÃ¡ma GÃ¡n drung   contains the history of  RÃ¡ma   from his infancy
until his marriage  the second   RÃ¡ma BÃ¡dra   from his marriage until
his consort   SÃ­ti DÃ©wi   is carried off by  RahwÃ¡na   the third
RÃ¡ma TÃ¡li   from the first employment of  HÃ¡numan  as a  dÃºta  or
messenger  until he builds the bridge from the continent to the island
Ang lÃ¡ngka di pÃºra   and the fourth  called  RamayÃ¡na   by which is
understood  RÃ¡ma  when arrived at his full power   from the beginning
of the war of  DÃ¡na LÃ¡ga  on  LÃ¡nka  till the end of it  when  RÃ¡ma
regains his consort  Siti DÃ©wi   and returns to  NayÃºdÃ­a   leaving
RahwÃ¡na s  brother   BibisÃ¡na   sovereign of  LÃ¡ngka   Of these
the  RÃ¡mayÃ¡na  is the most common on Java  The  RÃ¡ma TÃ¡li  has been
recently obtained from  BÃ¡li   This composition  as one poem  is by far
the most extensive of any which the Javans possess

The mythology contained in the  RÃ¡ma  differs  in some measure  from
that of the  KÃ¡nda    RÃ¡ma  is here made to relate to  BibisÃ¡na
in  ArtÃ¡ti  measure but  KÃ¡wi  language  that  BrÃ¡ma   in the first
instance  sprang from  WÃ­snu   that in the beginning of the world
WÃ­snu  existed in that part of the heavens named  AntabÃ³ga   the
place of serpents  that  BrÃ¡ma  first communicated the knowledge of
the  SÃ¡stra   Nine incarnations of  WÃ­snu  are then detailed  the
first  when he appeared as  Iwak MokÃºr mo   the tortoise   the second
as  Sing ha   the lion   when he was called  BarÃºna   the third  as
ArjÃºna WijÃ¡ya   the fourth in  WinÃ¡kitÃ¡ya  or  RÃ¡ma   In the fifth he
was to appear as  KrÃ©sna   and after the sixth  seventh  and eighth
in the ninth when he would become incarnate in the person of a great
sovereign  named  PrÃ¡bu PurÃºsa

AnrÃ¡ka SÃºra   the courageous child of the sun  is written in  KÃ¡wi
but translated into Javan  under the name of  BÃºma KalantÃ¡ka   or  Emba
tÃ¡li   The period to which it refers is that occupied posterior to that
of the  WiwÃ¡ha   and prior to that of the  BrÃ¡ta YÃºdha   It relates
almost exclusively to the exploits of  BÃºma   who was the son of  DÃ©wi
PratÃ­wi   of the race of  WidadÃ¡ris

DÃ©wi PratÃ­wi  being enamoured of  WÃ­snu   her thoughts were
continually turned towards him  notwithstanding he had been cast out
of  SuralÃ¡ya   One night having dreamt that her passion for him was
gratified  she conceived a child  She afterwards heard in her sleep a
voice saying to her   Descend to the earth in search of  KrÃ©sna   for
WÃ­snu  is become incarnate in his person  his colour is deep black
She descended accordingly  and established herself at  Praju tÃ©ksna
where she was delivered of a son  whom she named  BÃºma KalantÃ¡ka   When
he arrived at maturity  she informed him who was his father  and when
he discovered him he was received and acknowledged by him   KrÃ©sna  had
afterwards another son  named  SÃ¡mba   who having insulted the wife of
BÃºma  a quarrel arose between the two brothers  in which  BÃºma  put
SÃ¡mba  to death in a most disgraceful manner  mangling and exposing
his body   KrÃ©sna   enraged at this  threw his  ChÃ¡kra  at  BÃºma
desiring  GÃ¡tot KÃ¡cha  to raise him from the earth the moment he is
struck  lest the power of his mother should restore him   GÃ¡tot KÃ¡cha
obeys his orders and  BÃºma  is destroyed   SÃ©na   one of the sons of
PÃ¡ndu   is one of the personages of this poem

The history of the succeeding period is contained in the  BrÃ¡ta Yudha
or holy war  the most popular and esteemed work in the language  This
poem is identified in its subject with the  MahabÃ¡rat  of continental
India  in the same manner as that of  RÃ¡ma  is with the  RamÃ¡yan   An
analysis of this poem will be given under the head poetry

Next  in point of time  to this story  follows that of the poem called
ParakÃ­sit   which abounds with the praises of that prince  who was
the son of  BimÃ¡nyu  and grandson of  ArjÃºna   and is descriptive of
the tranquillity and happiness which universally prevailed during his
reign  It also contains an historical relation of the sovereigns who
succeeded him  and brings down the line of princes from  ParikÃ­sit
through ten descents to  Aji JÃ¡ya BÃ¡ya   as follows

     ParikÃ­sit

 1   SÃºma WichÃ­tra

 2   Ang ling DrÃ­a

 3   UdiÃ¡na

 4   MadiwÃ¡ng i

 5   MisÃ©na

 10   Aji JÃ¡ya BÃ¡ya

It was during the reign of the last of these princes that the first
intercourse with Western India is supposed to have taken place  an
account of the historical composition relating to a subsequent period
is therefore reserved for the chapters on History

The  SÃºria KÃ©tu   or lofty sun  contains in a few stanzas the history
of a prince  the fifth in descent from the  KurÃ¡wa   who by dint of
prayer to the gods obtained a son named  KÃ©rta SÃºma

The  NÃ­ti SÃ¡stra KÃ¡wi  is a work on ethics  comprized in one hundred
and twenty three stanzas  each of which contains a moral lesson  it is
considered coeval with  if not more ancient than the  BrÃ¡ta Yudha   and
the  KÃ¡wi  is considered the most pure extant  The modern version of
this work has already been referred to  and translations of some of the
stanzas have been introduced  The following are taken indiscriminately
and translated immediately from the  KÃ¡wi

 A man who is moderate and cool in his desires will do good to a
   country  A woman is like unto  DÃ©wi ManuhÃ¡ra  when her desires
   are moderate  and men cannot look upon her without delight  A
    PandÃ­ta  must act up to his doctrines  although it may be in war
   and difficulty  still he must act up to what he professes

 This must be the conduct of the  PandÃ­ta   If attacked by a
   serpent  he must not be moved by it  nor even by a lion  still
   the same  he must be firm and unmoved  and neither the serpent
   nor the lion will have power to hurt him

 As the  surÃ¡ja  flower floats in the water  so does the heart exist
   in a pure body  but let it not be forgotten  that the root of the
   flower holds to the ground  and that the heart of man depends
   upon his conduct in life  The conduct of a  PandÃ­ta  must be
   distinguished by mercy  charity  firmness  and prudence  His
   speech should be soft and gentle  and in accordance with and like
   unto written instruction  so as to moderate and calm the mind and
   desires of mankind

 It is mean and low for a rich man not to dress well  it is still
   more mean and low for a man of understanding to mix with bad
   company  So it is when a man attains a high age and knows not the
    SÃ¡stra   but when a man  through the whole course of his life
   does not reflect upon his conduct  such a man is of no use in the
   world whatever

 A man should wear that sort of apparel which in the general opinion
   is considered proper  and should also eat that kind of food which
   is generally approved of  If he does this  he will appear like
   unto a virgin  who has just attained maturity  Let him not follow
   implicitly the advice and instruction he may receive  but let him
   weigh them  and select what is good by his own understanding

 In war  let there be no fear on any account  but let the whole
   thoughts be directed to the main object of urging the warriors to
   the attack of the foe  Moreover  let the thoughts be directed to
   what may be the enemy s plans  this done  let the heart feel fire

 When a man engages another in his service  there are four points
   on which he should satisfy himself respecting him  First  his
   appearance  secondly  his conduct  thirdly  his intelligence  and
   fourthly  his honesty

 The most valuable property is gold  and whoever has much of it  if
   he does not assist those who are poor and in want  is like unto
   a house without a fence  and he will soon be deprived of the
   property which he possesses

 As the moon and the stars shed their light by night  and the
   sun giveth light by day  so should the sayings of a wise man
   enlighten all around him

 Follow not the seeming wisdom of a woman s discourse  for as a man
   is more powerful and better informed than a woman  it is fitter
   that he should stand on his own ground

 A man who knows not the customs of the country   yÃºdya NagÃ¡ra
   is like a man who would bind an elephant with cords made from
   the  tÃ¡njung  flower  It is not necessary for the elephant to be
   enraged  with the least motion he breaks the cords asunder

 Deprive not another of the credit which is due to him  nor lower
   him in the opinion of the world  for the sun  when he approaches
   near to the moon  in depriving her of her light adds nothing to
   his own lustre

 There is nothing better in the world than a man who keeps his word
   and there is nothing worse than a man who swerves from his word
   for he is a liar  There are five witnesses  which may be seen by
   every one   Yang anÃ¡la  or  BrÃ¡ma   fire    SÃºria   the sun
    ChÃ¡ndra   the moon    KÃ¡la   time    BÃ¡yu   life   And they are
   the great witnesses always present throughout the three worlds
   therefore let men recollect never to lie

 There are three things which destroy a man s character  and they
   are as three poisons  the first  to disgrace his family or lower
   himself  the second  to take delight in bringing misfortunes and
   unhappiness upon others  the third  to be a hypocrite  and assume
   the character of a  PandÃ­ta

Several works have been recently discovered in  BÃ¡li   called  AgÃ¡ma
AdigÃ¡ma    PÃºrwa DigÃ¡ma    SÃºrcha    MuschÃ¡yagÃ¡ma    KantÃ¡ra  or
SÃ¡stra MenÃ¡wa    DewagÃ¡ma    MaiswÃ¡ri    Tatwa    Wiya WasÃ¡ha
DÃ¡sta KalabÃ¡ya    SlÃ¡kan TaragÃ¡ma    SatmagÃ¡ma    GamÃ­ga GamÃ¡na   Of
many of these  copies have been procured  and the  SÃ¡stra MenÃ¡wa   or
institutions of  Menu   have been partially translated into English
This is a book of law comprised in about one hundred and sixty
sections  evidently written on the spot  and with reference to the
peculiar habits and dispositions of the people for whom it was framed
As a code of civil law  it is remarkable for the proof it affords of
the existence of actual property in the land  and as a criminal code
for the frequency of capital punishment  and the almost total absence
of all degrading or minor corporeal punishment

Of the more modern compositions  and which may be considered as more
strictly Javan  the following are the principal

AngrÃ©nÃ©  is an historical work  which commences with the reign of
Sri JÃ¡ya LangkÃ¡ra  sovereign of  MÃ©dang KamÃºlan   the grandfather
of the celebrated  PÃ¡nji   and concludes with the death of  PÃ¡nji
This is the longest work to be found in the modern literature of Java
and contains the most interesting and important part of Javan history
immediately antecedent to the establishment of Mahomedanism  It is
composed in several measures of the  SÃ©kar GÃ¡ngsal   and is usually
divided into several smaller works  to each of which the name of PÃ¡nji
is prefixed  as

PÃ¡nji Mordaningkung   The history of that part of the  PÃ¡nji s  life
when his consort   SÃ©kar tÃ¡ji   is carried off by a deity  This is
replete with relations of his adventures in war  and partly written in
the  SÃ©kar SÃ©poh  and partly in the  SÃ©kar GÃ¡ngsal

PÃ¡nji MagÃ¡t kung  relates to that period when the object of  PÃ¡nji s
love was not yet attained

PÃ¡nji Ã¡ng ron Ã¡kung   containing the particulars of marriage
ceremonies observed by  PÃ¡nji

PÃ¡nji priambÃ¡da   containing an account of the success and completion
of  PÃ¡nji s  love  and ending with his marriage

PÃ¡nji JÃ¡ya KasÃºma   This is one of the names assumed by  PÃ¡nji  after
the loss of his consort   SÃ©kar tÃ¡ji  and contains an account of his
expedition to  BÃ¡li   where he regained her

PÃ¡nji ChÃ©kel WÃ¡ning PÃ¡ti   when young brave even to death  contains
the juvenile exploits of this hero

PÃ¡nji Norowangsa  includes the period of his life  when the Princess
of  DahÃ¡  transforms herself into a man

Neither the date of the principal work from which these minor
compositions are taken  nor the name of the author is known  but it is
supposed to have been written subsequently to the time of  MajapÃ¡hit
the language being modern Javan

Literary compositions of the higher cast are generally classed by the
Javans under the head of  PepÃ¡kam  or  BÃ¡bat   the latter of which
includes all historical works and chronicles of modern date

SrÃºti  is a work which contains regulations for the conduct and
behaviour of an inferior to a superior  It is written in the  KÃ¡wi
language  but  ArtÃ¡ti  measure  and has not yet been translated into
Javan  It is of the same length as the  NÃ­ti SÃ¡stra KÃ¢wi

NÃ­ti PrÃ¡ja  is composed in the same measure as the  SrÃºti   and
contains regulations for the conduct of sovereigns and chiefs  partly
in the  KÃ¡wi  and partly in the Javan

Asta PrÃ¡ja  is a work of the same nature and similarly composed

SiwÃ¡ka  contains regulations for behaviour when in the presence of a
superior  in the Javan language and  ArtÃ¡ti  measure

NagÃ¡ra KrÃ¡ma   regulations for the good administration of the country
in the same language and measure

YÃºdha NagÃ¡ra   the customs of the country  containing rules for the
behaviour of persons of different ranks  in Javan and in the  ArtÃ¡ti
and  PamÃ­jil  measures

KamandÃ¡ka  contains instructions for inspiring respect and fear in the
exercise of authority  partly  KÃ¡wi   partly Javan  and in  ArtÃ¡ti
measure

The seven last mentioned works are supposed to have been written about
the same period  The  ChÃ¡ndra SangkÃ¡la  of the  SrÃºti  is 1340 of the
Javan era  From the allusion to  Islam  customs which they contain it
is concluded that they were all composed on the decline of  MajapÃ¡hit
at a period when the influence of that religion was rapidly gaining
ground  These works are in pretty general circulation  and form
the basis of the institutions and regulations of the country  The
translation already given of a modern version of the  NÃ­ti PrÃ¡ja  will
serve to shew their nature and tendency

JÃ¡ya LangkÃ¡ra  is a work supposed to have been written by a chief
of that name  when sovereign of  MÃ©dang KamÃºlan   and which contains
regulations for the highest judicial proceedings

JÃºgul MÃºda   supposed to have been written by  JÃºgul MÃºda  the  PÃ¡teh
or minister of  KandiÃ¡wan   chief of  MÃ©dang KamÃºlan   containing
rules for the guidance of  PÃ¡tehs  in the judicial department of their
office

GÃ¡ja MÃºda   a similar work  supposed to have been written by  GÃ¡ja
MÃºda   the  PÃ¡teh  of the great  BrowijÃ¡ya  of  MajapÃ¡hit

KÃ¡pa KÃ¡pa   regulations for the guidance of the sovereign in the
administration of justice

SÃºria Alem   a similar work for the guidance of all persons entrusted
with authority  supposed to have been composed by  Aji JÃ­mbon   the
first Mahomedan sovereign of Java

None of the above works are written in verse  They form the basis of
what may be called the common law of the country  The translation of
the modern version of the last of these  contained in the Appendix
will serve to convey some idea of the nature and spirit of this class
of compositions

Besides the above may be noticed another work called  JÃ¡ya LangkÃ¡ra   a
romance  supposed to have been written in the time of  SusÃºnan Ampel
in the Javan language and modern measures  This is a moral work of
considerable length  written in allegory  and pointing out the duties
of all classes

The  JÃ³war ManÃ­kam  is of a more recent date  and a general favourite
it may convey some notion of the modern romances of the Javans



 That is true love which makes the heart uneasy

 There was a woman who shone like a gem in the world  for she was
   distinguished by her conduct  and her name was  JÃ³war ManÃ­kam

 Perfect was her form  and she was descended from a devotee  from
   whom she derived her purity and the rules of her conduct

 Her beauty was like that of the children of heaven   widadÃ¡ris
   and men saw more to admire in her  than was to be found on the
   plains  on the mountains  or in the seas



 Pure was her conduct  like that of a saint  and she never forgot
   her devotions to the deity  all evil desires were strangers to
   her heart

 She rose superior above the multitude from following the dictates
   of religion  and in no one instance was her heart disturbed by a
   bad thought or desire  so that her life was without reproach

 What pity it is she hath not a lover  for when a young and handsome
   woman obtains a husband of high character and qualifications  it
   is as milk mixed with sugar



 When her virtue was assailed by the  PanghÃºlu   she was astonished
   and exclaimed   why dost thou thus take the course of a thief
   why dost thou act in this manner

  Art thou not prohibited from doing thus  forgettest thou thy
    RÃ¡ja   and fearest thou not thy God

  And thinkest thou not either of thyself  Greatly dost thou
   astonish me  Is not thy conduct bad even before the world  but
   being forbidden by the Almighty  art thou not afraid of his
   anger



  If such be thy desire  I can never consent to its indulgence  for
   I fear my God  and for all such deeds the punishment from heaven
   is great

  Rather let me follow the course pointed out by the prophet  let me
   imitate the conduct of his child Fatima

  How comes it  that thy inclination is so evil towards me  Verily
   if my father knew of this proceeding  wouldst thou not justly
   receive severe punishment

The  PanghÃºlu  thus frustrated in his design  writes in revenge to
her father  and informs him that his daughter has made a fruitless
endeavour to seduce him  upon hearing which the deceived parent orders
her to be put to death  Her brother is about to put this order in
execution  when placing his hand before his eyes while he inflicts the
blow  he stabs a small deer in lieu of his sister  who escapes into the
woods

 With rapidity she fled to the woods  and then taking shelter under
   a wide spreading  warÃ­ng en  tree  the still unripe fruits of the
   forest attained maturity  and seemed to offer themselves as a
   relief to her

 All the flowers  though the season for opening their petals was not
   arrived  now expanded  and shedding their fragrance  it was borne
   by a gentle zephyr towards her  while the  bramÃ¡ra   attracted
   by the odour  swarmed around  and the fragrance of each flower
   seemed to vie with the other in reaching her presence

 The wild animals of the forest  the tiger  the wild ox  the
   rhinoceros came towards the princess  as if to watch and guard
   her  crouching around her  but occasioning not the least alarm



 Being in want of water  the princess put up a prayer to heaven
   when close by her feet a spring of pure water issued

 On which the  sarÃ³ja  flower soon appeared  opening its petals
   and offering the shade of a  pÃ¡yung  to the smaller water plants
   floating beneath

 Her heart now became easy  and delighted at what she beheld  she
   proceeded to bathe and perform her devotions

The father  on his return  learns the treachery of the  PanghÃºlu
and having recovered his daughter  she is subsequently married to
a neighbouring prince  by whom she has three children  Her trials
however  are not yet at an end  for being on a journey to visit her
father  accompanied by the  PepÃ¡teh  of her husband  who is appointed
to guard her on the way  the  PepÃ¡teh  forms a design upon her virtue
He is represented as saying

  If you  oh princess  submit not to my desires  it is my
   determination to put your eldest child to death

 The princess on hearing this became so affected as to be deprived
   of speech

 When the  PepÃ¡teh  again repeating his threat in a solemn manner

 She replied   what would you have me say  Whatever may be the will
   of God I must submit  If my child is to die  how can I prevent
   it

 The  PepÃ¡teh   on hearing this  forthwith drew his sword  and slew
   the child  again demanding of the princess whether she would
   submit to his desires  To which she answered   No

 He again urged her  but the princess hanging down her head was
   silent  and in the hope that God would give her resolution  her
   mind became more easy

 The  PepÃ¡teh  then shaking his sword before the princess  again
   urged her to submit  threatening that if she refused he would
   slay her second child

 But the princess could only reply   you must act as you say  if it
   is the will of God that you should do so

 He then slew the second child  and again urging her to submit
   threatened  in case of refusal  that he would slay the third
   child  then at her breast

 Snatching the child from her arms  he put his threat into
   execution  and the blood flew on the mother s face  on which she
   swooned and fell to the ground

 The  PepÃ¡teh  having succeeded in recovering her  again attempted
   to effect his purpose  threatening that if she still refused he
   would slay her  to this the princess at first made no reply

 But placing her sole reliance on the Almighty  a thought at last
   struck her  and she said

  Do as you will with me  but seeing that I am disfigured with
   blood  allow me first to bathe in an adjacent stream

The  PepÃ¡teh  assenting to this  she went away and effected her escape
into the woods  There she remained in safety  until discovered by her
husband  who in revenge put the three children of the  PepÃ¡teh  to
death

It has already been shewn  that notwithstanding the intercourse
which has now subsisted for upwards of four centuries  and the full
establishment of the Mahomedan as the national religion of the country
for upwards of three centuries  the Arabic has made but little or
no inroad into the language  and it may be added  that the Arabic
compositions now among them are almost exclusively confined to matters
of religion  Books in the Javan language are occasionally written
in the Arabic character  and then termed  PÃ©gu   but this practice
is by no means general  The  KÃ³ran  was first translated  or rather
paraphrased  about a century ago  and rendered into Javan verse by a
learned man of  PranarÃ¡ga   to whom the title of  Kiai PranarÃ¡ga  was
in consequence given

Arabic books  however  are daily increasing in number  The principal
works in this language  with which the Javans are at present
acquainted  are the  Umul brahin   by  Sheik Usuf Sanusi    MohÃ¡rrar
by  Iman Abu HanÃ­fa    Ranlo Taleb   by  Sheik Islam Zachariah   and
Insan Kamil   by  Sheik Abdul Karim Jili   The doctrines of  Sheik
Mulana Ishak   the father of  SusÃºnan GÃ­ri  and one of the earliest
missionaries  were those of  Abu HanÃ­fa   which are the same as the
Persians are said to profess  but these doctrines have  subsequent to
the time of  SusÃºnan GÃ­ri   been changed for those of  Shafihi   There
are  however  some who still adhere to the doctrines of  HÃ¡nifa   but
their numbers are few  and the chiefs are all followers of  Shafihi
The number of Arabic tracts circulating on Java has been estimated at
about two hundred

Several institutions have been established in different parts of
the island  for the instruction of youth in the Arabic language and
literature  At one of these  in the district of  PranarÃ¡ga   there were
at one time  about seventy years ago  in the time of  PÃ¡ku NagÃ¡ra
not less than fifteen hundred scholars  This institution has since
fallen into decay  and the number at present does not exceed three or
four hundred  Similar institutions are established at  MelÃ¡ng i   near
MatÃ¡rem   and at  SÃ­damÃ¢rmar   near  SurabÃ¡ya   and at  BÃ¡ntam   about
eighty years ago  there existed an institution  of nearly equal extent
with that of  PranarÃ¡ga

Literary compositions are almost invariably written in verse  The
measures employed are of three classes  First  the  sekÃ¡r 140  kÃ¡wi
or measures in which the  kÃ¡wi  compositions are generally written
secondly  the  sekÃ¡r sepoh   high or ancient measures  thirdly  the
sekÃ¡r gÃ¡ngsal   or five modern measures

A complete stanza is termed a  pÃ¡da   literally a foot   a line is
termed  ukÃ¡ra   the long syllables are termed  gÃºru   the short  lÃ¡ku
and although rhyme is not used  the several measures of the  sekÃ¡r
sepoh  and  gÃ¡ngsal  are regulated by the terminating vowels of each
line  which are fixed and determined  for each particular kind of
verse 141   by the number of syllables in each line  the disposition of
the long syllables  and the number of lines in each stanza or  pÃ¡da

Of the  sekÃ¡r kÃ¡wi  there are twelve radical stanzas  most of which
occur in the  NÃ­ti SÃ¡stra  and other principal  KÃ¡wi  compositions
They are named

 1   StradÃºla wikrindÃ­ta
 2   JÃ¡ga dÃ­ta
 3   WahÃ­rat
 4   BasÃ¡nta tilÃ¡ka
 5   BÃ¡gsapÃ¡tra
 6   SrÃ¡gdÃ¡ra
 7   SekarÃ­ni
 8   SuwandÃ¡na
 9   ChampÃ¡ka mÃ¡liar
 10   PrÃ¡wira lalÃ­tÃ¡
 11   BasÃ¡nta lÃ­la
 12   DÃ¡nda

Each of these stanzas consists of four lines  as in the following
example of the  SradÃºla WÃ­krindita   from the  NÃ­ti SÃ¡stra KÃ¡wi

    Reng jÃ¡nma di kÃ¡mi ta chÃ­ta resÃ©ping sÃ¡rwa prÃ¡ja ng enaka
    Ring s tri matdia manuÃ¡ra prÃ­a wawus andÃ© mÃ¡na kung lÃºlut
    Yen ring MadiÃ¡ni kang pinandÃ®ta mochap tetÃ³ah pa dÃ©sa prÃ®en
    Yen ring matdÃ­a nikÃ¡ng mosa mochap akan wakchÃºra sing a k roti



   A man who is moderate and cool in his desires will do good to a
       country
   A woman is like unto  DÃ©wi ManuhÃ¡ra  when her desires are moderate
       and men cannot look upon her without admiration
   A  PandÃ­ta  must at all times and on all occasions act up to his
       doctrines
   Whether it be in war or in difficulty  still he must act up to what he
       says

Examples of several other measures of the  sekÃ¡r kÃ¡wi  and of the metre

In order the better to illustrate the poetry and literature of Java
and to exhibit the nature and spirit of the compositions in the  KÃ¡wi
I request to present the reader with an analysis of the  BrÃ¡ta Yudha
the most popular and celebrated poem in the language  Versions of this
poem in the modern Javan are common throughout the island  and the
subject is the theme of the most popular and interesting amusements of
the country

The  Brata YÃºdha Kawi   of which the following is the analysis  and
from which the illustrations which are interspersed are taken  contains
seven hundred and nineteen  pÃ¡da  or metrical stanzas  of four long
lines each  the measures varying with the subject  so that most of the
twelve  KÃ¡wi  measures are to be found in it  Considering how little
was known on Java of the  KÃ¡wi  language  and how likely that little
was to be lost for ever  I felt a strong interest in analysing and
translating  as far as practicable  one of the principal compositions
in that language  and availing myself of the literary acquirements
of the  Panambahan  of  Sumenap   to whom I have already adverted
and of the assistance of a gentleman of my family  and  Raden Saleh
the son of the regent of  SemarÃ¡ng   I have it now in my power to lay
the following analysis of this ancient poem before the public  It is
far from being as complete  or correct  as I could have wished  yet
imperfect as it is  it may serve to convey some idea of the original
I have endeavoured to keep as close to the original as possible  and
have  in every instance  given the interpretation of the  KÃ¡wi   as far
as it was understood by the  Panambahan   The Sanscrit scholar will
probably find imperfections  and possibly might be able to render a
better translation  but it is the  KÃ¡wi  language  as it is understood
by the Javans of the present day  that I am anxious to illustrate
The original stanzas are given in the  KÃ¡wi   and I only regret that
the limited knowledge of the language possessed by the  Panambahan
himself  and my own want of time to study and trace the grammatical
construction of it  have not admitted of my doing more justice to
the original  I can safely affirm  that independent of the interest
which the subject loses by translation into a foreign language  the
illustrations now given afford but a very imperfect specimen of the
beauty  sublimity  and real poetry of the original

This celebrated work would appear from the  ChÃ¡ndra SangkÃ¡la  included
in one of the verses  to have been composed by one  PusÃ©da   a learned
PandÃ­ta   in the year 1079  Some copies  however  admit of a different
interpretation regarding the date  and the general opinion is  that
it was composed in 706 of the Javan era  during the reign of a prince
on whom was conferred the title of  JÃ¡ya BÃ¡ya   Whether the poem was
actually written on Java  or brought by the early colonists  may be
questionable  but the Javans of the present day firmly believe  not
only that the poem was written on Java  but that the scene of the
exploits which it records was also laid on Java and  MadÃºra   The
annexed sketch  with the subjoined note  will explain the situation of
the different countries  according to this notion 144

same spirit  the modern capital of the sultan of  Matarem   called
by the Dutch  Djocjo carta   but more correctly  Ayog ya Kerta   was
so named by its founder  about sixty years ago  after  Ayudya  the
celebrated capital of  Rama

There are three peaks in different parts of the Island  which still
retain the name of  Indra KÃ­la   the mountain on which  ArjÃºna
performed  tapa   one on the mountain  ArjÃºna   near  SurabÃ¡ya   one
on  Morea  at  Japara   and another on the  Ung arang  mountain  near
SemÃ¡rang

At the foot of  Semiru   the name of one of the highest mountains on
the eastern part of the island  is supposed to have been situated the
country of  Newata   better known as the residence of  Detia Kewacha
who reigned before the war of the  BrÃ¡ta Yudha

On  Gunung PrÃ¡hu   a range of lofty mountains inland between
Pakalungan  and  SemÃ¡rang   are the remains of nearly four hundred
temples  or buildings  with the traces of an extensive city  This
is supposed to have been the burying place of the ancestors of the
PandÃ¡wa   as well as of  ArjÃºna   The site of the temples was formerly
called  Rah tawu   the place whence blood was washed  from a tradition
that when  Pula Sara  was born  his mother immediately died  on which
the  DÃ©wa  came and received the infant on its coming into the world

In the performance of the  wÃ¡yang   in which the heroes of these
historical romances are exhibited  the common people of  Jawana  never
exhibit that part of the history which relates to the juvenile days
of  KrÃ©sna   from a superstitious apprehension  that the alligators
would  in such event  overrun the country  these animals being supposed
to be the transformed followers of  KÃ¡ngsa   At  Pamalang   also
there is a similar prohibition with regard to representing  ArÃ­mba
the brother in law of  BÃ­ma   under a dread  that if the  DÃ¡lang
should  by accident  not represent the story with exactness  he would
inevitably fall sick on the first mistake

The country of  Parakisit   after the  Brata Yudha   is supposed to
have been near  SemÃ¡rang   and on that account the  DÃ¡lang  will not
perform that part of the history which relates to his reign  although
it forms a very principal portion in the performances elsewhere

To these superstitions may be added  that although with these local
exceptions the  wÃ¡yang  may represent any portion of the  BrÃ¡ta
Yudha   or of the preceding or subsequent histories of the same
class  there is a prevalent superstition  that a great war will be
the inevitable consequence of performing  at one sitting  the whole
of this poem  It is gravely asserted  that a chief of  Kendal  tried
this experiment about fifty years ago  but that the performance was no
sooner completed  than his country was laid waste and destroyed  and
also that  previous to the Javan war  the grandfather of the present
Susunan  Sida Langkungang   ordered the whole of the  BrÃ¡ta YÃºdha  to
be performed at once  the consequence of which was the dreadful war
which ensued  and the dismemberment of the empire

These impressions and superstitions may seem to evince  how deeply
rooted is the belief that the scene of this poem was in Java

The scene of the  RÃ¡mayan   on the contrary  is not believed to have
been on Java  but there is an impression  that after the death of
RawÃ¡na    HÃ¡numan  fled to Java  and took refuge in the district
of  AmbarÃ¡wa   near  SemÃ¡rang   on a hill called  Kandali SÃ¡da
the place named in the  Ramayan  where  Hanuman  performed  tapa
penance   There is still a post or pillar preserved to distinguish
this spot at the summit of the hill  and such is the superstition of
the neighbourhood  that they never perform the  wÃ¡yang  representing
any part of the history of  RÃ¡ma   lest  Hanuman  should pelt them with
stones

The annexed plate shews the situation of the principal places mentioned
in the  BrÃ¡ta YÃºdha   according to the prevailing notions of the Javans

AN ANALYSIS

OF

THE BRÃTA YÃšDHA

OR HOLY WAR  OR RATHER THE WAR OF WOE

AN EPIC POEM

IN THE KÃWI OR CLASSIC LANGUAGE OF JAVA


INTRODUCTORY REMARKS

The wife of  SantÃ¡nu   king of  AstÃ­na   dying on giving birth to  DÃ©wa
BrÃ¡ta    BÃ­sma     SantÃ¡nu  asked  PulÃ¡sara   the  PrÃ¡bu Anom   or
younger prince   of  WirÃ¡ta   and brother in law of  MÃ¡ngsah PÃ¡ti
prince of that country  to allow his wife  AmbarsÃ¡ri   who at that time
had a child   AbiÃ¡sa   at the breast  to suckle and so save the life of
his infant boy  DÃ©wa BrÃ¡ta

PulasÃ¡ra   offended at the proposal  went to war with  SantÃ¡nu   but
was afterwards persuaded by the  DÃ©wa Sang yang NarÃ¡da  to comply  on
condition of  SantÃ¡nu  resigning his kingdom to him  to which  SantÃ¡nu
agreed   PulasÃ¡ra   when his son  AbiÃ¡sa  was grown up  gave him the
kingdom of  AstÃ­na   and turning hermit  went and passed the rest of
his days on the mountains

By his wife  AmbalÃ­ka   the old maiden daughter of  BaliÃ©tma   a hermit
of  GÃºnung ChÃ¡maragÃ¡ndi   whom he was forced to marry against his
inclination   AbiÃ¡sa  had three sons  viz

 1   DrestarÃ¡ta   who was blind
 2   PÃ¡ndu   whose head was inclined to one side
 3   Aria WidÃºra   who was lame

PÃ¡ndu   the least exceptionable of the three sons  being raised to the
throne   AbiÃ¡sa  turned hermit  and went and passed the remainder of
his days among the mountains

On the death of  PÃ¡ndu    DrestarÃ¡ta  persuaded his father  AbiÃ¡sa
to allow him to rule the country during the minority of the  PÃ¡ndÃ¡wa
or five children of  PÃ¡ndu    These were  DÃ©rma Wangsa    BÃ­ma   and
ArjÃºna   born of his wife  DÃ©wi KÃºnti   and  NakÃºla  and  SedÃ©wa
born of his wife  DÃ©wi Madrim

DrestarÃ¡ta  however afterwards persuaded them to go to a wild
uncultivated place called  AmÃ©rta   and establish a kingdom there
furnishing them  for that purpose  with the requisite implements  and a
thousand men to enable them to clear away and cultivate the country

Through the assistance of  MangsÃ¡h Pati   the king of  WirÃ¡ta   uncle
to  AbiÃ¡sa    the country of  AmÃ©rta  was completed  but not until the
thousand men had all been devoured by demons  of whom  PÃ¡rta  was the
chief

DrestarÃ¡ta  retained possession of  AstÃ­na   and afterwards resigned
it to his sons  the  KurÃ¡wa   in number ninety seven

The hundred was completed by the addition of  KÃ©rna   the son of  DÃ©wi
KÃºnti  before marriage  by  BatÃ¡ra Suria   and of  Jaya drÃ¡ta  and
AswatÃ¡ma

The incarnate  DÃ©wa    KrÃ©sna   having been deputed by the  PandÃ¡wa
whose part he takes  to propose to the king of  KurÃ¡wa  an equal
division of the kingdom of  AstÃ­na  between the  KurÃ¡wa  and  PandÃ¡wa
and his proposal being rejected  the  PandÃ¡wa  go to war for the
kingdom which was left them by their father  and which in justice they
ought to have had  The  KurÃ¡wa  are ultimately beaten  and the kingdom
of  AstÃ­na  recovered by the  PandÃ¡wa

The scene of the poem lies chiefly in the hostile plains of
KuruksÃ©tra   close to  AstÃ­na   whither it sometimes shifts  The time
of it is about a month  the same being the fifth of the year

The poem opens as follows

                         Measure  JagadÃ­ta

   1  In war  tis the prayer of the brave to annihilate the foe
   To see the braids of fallen chiefs scattered like flowers before the
       wind
   To rend their garments  and burn alike their altars and their palaces
   Boldly to strike off their heads while seated in their chariots  and
       thus to obtain renown

   2  Such was the prayer  of  JÃ¡ya BÃ¡ya   offer d to the three worlds
       for success in battle
   Such was the resolve of  BatÃ¡ra NÃ¡ta  146  against those whom he knew
       to be his enemies
   And the name and power of  PadÃºka BatÃ¡ra JÃ¡ya BÃ¡ya  became famous
       throughout the world
   Confirmed and approved by all good men and by the four classes of
        PandÃ­ta  147

   3  The lord of the mountains descended with all his  PandÃ­ta
   And the prince approached him with respect and a pure heart
   The deity was pleased  and said    Aji JÃ¡ya BÃ¡ya    be not afraid
   I come to thee not in anger  but according to thy desire  to endow
       thee with the power of conquest



                      Awigno mastutina masidam

   Mang go sampun ninastoakan sujana len duijawara Resi Siwa Sugata

   4  Receive from me a blessing  oh my son  JÃ¡ya BÃ¡ya    Hear me  In thy
       country
   Thou shall become the chief of the whole circle of princes  and in war
       victorious over the enemy
   Be firm and fear not  for thou shalt become as a  BatÃ¡ra
   This declaration pronounced with solemnity  was treasured in the
       memory of all the holy  PandÃ­ta  of heaven

   5  Thus having bestowed his blessing  the  BatÃ¡ra  vanished
   And the enemies of the prince being overcome with fear  submitted to
       him
   Tranquil and happy was every country  The thief stood aloof during the
       reign of this prince
   And the lover alone stole his pleasure  seeking his object by the
       light of the moon

   6  It was at this time  PusÃ©da  148  rendered memorable the date
        risang a kuda suda chandrama  149
   When the brilliancy with which the enemy was defeated was like unto
       the brightness of the sun at the third season
   And the mercy which was shewn to them was like the moon at the full
   For in war he looked upon the enemy  as the lord of the wild beasts
       would eye his prey



   4  Tang gap tosna nograha ku ri wukang ku Jaya Baya rang e nikang Praja
   Satiastu prabu chakra wartia kita ring sabuana Jaya satru ring mosu
   Tekuan lang gen a satmaka na ku lawan kita tulusa Batara ring Jagat
   Yekan sabda nira tro telasi nastoakan nira resi sang gia ring lang it

   5  Sampun mangkana suksma reh nira Batara telasi ramawÃ© ka nograha
   Tanduan nut samusu nareswara pada pranata teka rihing mabupati
    Enak tand li reng sarat maling awah layata wadi risakti sang Prabu
   Hangheng tan udi sapsabÃ© wang ng atajeng teka sumilip pipajang ing
       wulan

   6  Nowan don Puseda makirtia sasakala risang a kuda sud da Chandrama
   Sang saksat ari morti yen Katiga nitia maka palaga saktining musu
   San lir lek prati pada sukla pinalaku nahurip pawijil nireng ripu
   Ring prang derpa pasu prabu pamanira Yuni Kadung ola ning parang muka



   7  Then  BatÃ¡ra SÃ©wa  came and said to him
    This is the time proper to relate the war between the  PandÃ¡wa  and
       the princes of  KÃ³ra
   A relation which is not intended for the regulation of the country or
       the conduct of men  but is like  sÃ­ri  with burnt lime
   Which affects not the teeth  but gives inward satisfaction and
       delight

   8  In former times   NarÃ¡rÃ­a KrÃ©sna  was the friend of  NaranÃ¡ta
       PandÃ¡wa
   And he urged them saying   Request from  SuyudÃ¡na   the chief of the
        KÃºru
    Nothing less than a division of the country of the  KÃºru
    If he accede  it is well  if not  a great war shall be raised

   9  Thus having advised he hastily departed  and quitted  WirÃ¡ta
       followed by  SatiÃ¡ki
   He mounted his chariot of swift footed coursers  which sped through
       the air as if with wings
   And soon discerned the city of  GajahÃºya  150   breaking through the
       clouds  Sad
   Looked her  warÃ­ngen tree  151   like unto a sorrowful wife separated
       from her husband



   7  Biakta chamana pada Pangkaja Batara seiva mara ng omastawa sira
   Yogya mang galaning mikat prangira Pandawa maka laga KorawÃ© s wara
   Dan Duran kawasa alip kadi s ru pama hugi mahapu susu gesang
   Mang so tan sedap panya ring waja tuhon pamurna mang on resÄ“pi ng ati

   8  Ng ani Kala Narario Krisna pinaka seraya nira Naranatu pandawa
   SinoÃ© Kara Kinon lumakqua dateng ing kurupati mang aran Suriodana
   Tan lean don nanira malaku rika paliani pura Nararia Kurawa
   Yukpuan pasra atut ta ratqua yedi tan pasung a karana ning prang at
       Buta

   9  Dan mangka sira sigra Sakari Wirata dinolur ri ng anama Satiaki
   Heng gal prapta tekap nisacti ni turang ga Nirata nira pinda hanglayang
   Kong ang desa nikang Gajahuya pura awu Kinemol laneng udan riwut
   Uruk warnani wandirania kadi soka makemoli paning gal ling pria



   10  The corners of the gateways seemed to bow as he advanced
   And their turrets to beckon to  JanardÃ¡ni  to hasten on
   The branches of the serpent flower 152  waved in the wind  as if in
       obeisance
   And all the beauty of the city of the  KÃºrus  appeared to enquire
       whether he were followed by the  PandÃ¡wa

   11  But  NarÃ¡ria KesÃ¡wa  had left the sons of  PÃ¡ndu  at  WirÃ¡ta
   The appearance of every thing on the road was sad  sorrowful was the
       sound of the bird  chÃºchur
   And the  jring  plant was drooping and fallen  bearing down with it to
       the ground the  pÃ¡ndan  flower
   Mournful was the moaning of the bird  walikitÃ¡dÃ¡hasi  crying on the
       branch of a tree



   10  Punchak punchaki gopuran ia aturang ng adang a ri sira mong gu ri
       ng nu
   Kadio gir ri tekar Janardana panambahi pataka nekang nawe Katon
   Warna nambahi pang nikang bujaga puspa magiu anu mimba kang  inan
   Saksat laxmini kang puri kuru matakoana ri milu Nararia Pandawa

   11  Dan Bahnan kari Pandu Patra ri Wirata tekapira Nararia Kesawa
   YÃ©ka soka lang an ikang awana kunda manang isa sekal chuchur neka
   Mangka j ring malumi dawu pudaki Pandani ka makilusu aning Watu
   Hing hing sabdani kang Waliktadahasi pada manang isi pang nikang tahan



   12  Bright and beautiful was the city of  GajahÃºya   till it was known
       that the  PandÃ¡wa  did not follow
   The  champÃ¡ka  flower was full blown and ready to fall
   The faded flowers of the  tanjung  were caught in the spider s web
   And the dark beetle 153   almost lifeless  in sadness sought the
       flowers of  AngsÃ¡na   which floated on the waters

   13  Dry was the course in which the rivulet had flowed
   And the stone images looked in sadness at the marks which the water
       had left on the rocks
   The shell fish 154  had deserted their covering
   And the dead shells were left on the banks by the retiring waters

   14  Unlike this was the appearance of the  rÃ¡was  155   which
       resembled an assemblage at the  paseban  156
   On their banks grew the flower  rajÃ¡sa  157   entwined by the
        suwÃ¡rna  158   as a golden ornament worn by men
   The white flowered  tÃ¡njung  having reclosed its petals  hung like a
       closed  pÃ¡yung  159
   And the small fish were frisking with delight in the waters



   12  Kapua sa leng ang ing Gajahuya ri tan padulur rira Nararia Pandawa
   Hunia champaka malugas Kusuma paksa Malabua jurang nikang parung
   Lampus tanjung ng ika ng anas layati gantung i panawang ng aning
       jaring jaring
   Tan patma Bramara kusa nang isi layuani ng asana manot yiriaking banyu

   13  Mangkania sani panchurania pada soka ri taya nira sang danang jaya
   Unia lek magegeng molat kapenatan rika patini lumot nikang watu
   Sangsara Karachakechap mulati pandaga nika ri pipinya tan padon
   Ka res res ni susunya mati manolat tiba tiwati mukar juning sela

   14  Tan mangka kalang ang nikang rawarawen Masemu lumiating wang hing
       saba
   Tirania nadar Rajasa kayu suwarna Mamolacti atur gelang kuning
   Mang ka tunjung i kang sekar wali ping olani ka pada payung ping ol
   Sarwecha pachuring sunhunbras ika yan pabanyubanyu mang anti ring renek



   15  And as he came close to the city  the approach was cleared
   The  wÃºng or  flowers hung in abundance like reclining pillows
   The  tanjÃºng  flower was open  like an expanded  payÃºng
   And the  pÃ©tung  160  was surpassed by the beauty of the  gÃ¡ding  161
       sprouts  which shewed like the  gÃ¡ding  flower

   16  And the woods were as if no one could tell whether there was good
       or bad in them  and the rocks were as if deaf and dumb
   The beetle buzzed at a distance from the flowers of the  dÃ¡dap  and
       the  sÃ­ri   for it knew not the taste of them
   The bird  chat da  played like unto the bird  kiong  162   when in its
       glory in the woods
   And the joints of the sugar cane attracted not the eye

                         Measure  SuandÃ¡na

   17  Delightful and pleasant were the roads of  AstÃ­na
   And soon on the plains 163  of  KÃºru  did the good  KrÃ©sna  arrive
   There was he joined by the heroes  KÃ¡nwa    JanÃ¡ka   and  NarÃ¡dÃ¡
   Who were found by him on the plain  and who entered his service



   15  Sing gi yan maparek puraraja mahalep alep anoluhi ri nika ng enu
   Banonia Suraga tulis makalasa bari tuwuni nika sinang rateng
   Mangka tinkahi patmaraga nika sayana sekara pajeng pajeng dadu
   Tan pasri tekapi petung gading bung nia pada tumota pawahan gading

   16  Lir tanuru hihunadika alas apinda bisu tuli watunia ring jurang
   Monya Kumbang i kumbang i rang en ado weruha rechap ika puspa ning seda
   Chang gang chang ga manuknia chutda nachading kiong atuwa Kalang aning

   Tekuan tan kahanan w las harep pula nisi paha nika tan lumis mata

                          Tembang SuandÃ¡na

   18  Immediately the excellent  KrÃ©sna  took the charioteer s seat
   Giving up his own in the chariot to the three  PÃ¡ndita   and making
       obeisance to them
   They returning the salute
   Inwardly prayed for the welfare of  KrÃ©sna

   19  The  PÃ¡nditas  were much pleased by  KrÃ©sna s  taking the
       charioteer s place
   And as they were borne along  they talked of their journey to the King
       of  AstÃ­na
   And also discussed many weighty matters
   While mildly flowed their words like a gentle stream

   20  When the worthy  KrÃ©sna  was yet on the plain of  KÃºru
    DrÃ³tarÃ¡ja  soon heard of his coming
   And gave orders to clean and dust the palace
   Directing  at the same time  the finest cloths to be spread on the
       ground from the royal seat  outside  as far as the great square

   21  It was at the same time required of all to show respect
   Such were the orders of  Aria BÃ­sma  and  DratarÃ¡stra
    SakÃºni    Kerna    DuryodÃ¡na   alone refused to obey  turning away
       and shewing their backs
   This they did  perceiving intuitively that the great among men was
       acting in concert with the  PandÃ¡wa



   18  Wawang sira nararya kresna numaring gwaning sarate
   Sirang parama sapta pandita gumanti mung gweng rata
   Turawin sira telas winorsita malas mawe nastute
   Monagya keni ayu a sang prabu yan non nera ng astawa

   19  Lengeng alapira daran pinaka sarati yang resi
   Tohor muchapi doniran lari mereng narape Astina
   Datan nia juga rakwa gostinÃ©ra sarwa tat wa dika
   Lumot wijili sabda sang resi kabe mawerna merta

   20  Sedeng anari kang tegal kuru nararya kresnan laku
   Rika ta drotaraja sigra rumeng o dateng sang prabu
   Nimitani lebu nekang pura kinon naken busanan
   Pada natara wastra mulia tekaring wang ontur batuk

   21  Tuwen pada ginositan sira kabe kinon sambrama
   Tekap nira sangarya bisma dratarasta motus tinut
   Kunang sira wi ang ming e sakune karna duryodana
   Apan warui mana janardana sapaksa ring pandawa



   22  The various viands in the interior of the palace being prepared
       and laid out
    KesÃ¡wa  164  arrived before the city
   When grateful sounds struck up from various musical instruments
   As slowly advanced his chariot to the hall of audience

   23  The people  desirous of beholding the royal arrival  and afraid of
       being too late
   Hurried in crowds to where they might have a view of him
   Adjusting their dress and tying up their hair as they ran along
   And some  who had left the operation unfinished  came with their teeth
       partly black and partly white

   24  While others  among the women  held up their breasts with both
       hands
   As if they were going to present them to the exalted among men 165
   Children  too  bore along in their arms their ivory dolls
   And caused them  when they came to the looking place  to acknowledge
       and bow to him  whom they pointed out as their royal father



   22  Sedeng masaji boga sadrasa samong gu ring jero puri
   Samantara dateng ta kesawa anengarepning kuta
   Lengeng tekapikang garangtung ngamapak umong gurnita
   Tuwen rata nera rere lakunekan dateng ring saba

   23  Ikang wang aharap tumingala risang narÃ©ndran dateng
   Pada garawalan maring pangu ngangan wedi kantuna
   Ana mahayu kesa ta pana gelung rusak ringenu
   Dudu tanga sisik atur inaliwa katen tan tulus

   24  Wane tangalayu manag gari susunya karwÃ©ng tangan
   Ya pwan sunga keneng janardana aturnya nang giwakna
   Ana nakanakan gadeng makilayu mamhban leng en
   Tekeng pangu ngangan kinon ika mangakua rama aji



   25  There were also seen among the throng  those who  leaving off the
       duties of the toilet  and taking with them their looking glass and
       paint brush
   Appeared as if they were hastening to officiate for the prince
   Others there were  whose hands contained unfinished garlands of
       flowers  which they had been making  and
   Which they seemed to be running to give to his highness

   26  Others ran so fast  that they dropt and lost their garments by the
       way
   Such was their fear of being too late to see the prince go by
   The overloaded ladders broke down with the weight of people upon them
   And the extended mouths of those who fell prostrate  gave them the
       appearance of persons under the influence of liquor

                      Measure  BasÃ¡nta tilÃ¡ka

   27  It would be endless to describe the various sights which presented
       themselves among the astonished multitude
   Enough that the royal  KrÃ©sna  reached the palace
   But it was not the palace of the King of  AstÃ­na  which he went into
   It was that of the  Aria DrastarÃ©sta



   25  Wane tanga payas wa u saha sipatnia mung geng sadak
   Yaya ngotusa mahiasan ni patane narÃ©ndra dateng
   Mewah tanga ngiket sekar ana ri asta tapwan tulus
   Sawang kapalajeng makana kusuman paninjo aji

   26  Nian tang hamregen umirakani kenya sak ringenu
   Rires nika kasÃ©pa yan lumiyati  alintang aji
   Kuneng pwari saraknya mung ga hirikang Saganya tikel

   28  There he found assembled  DrÃºna    BÃ­sma    KrÃ©pa   and  SÃ¡lia
   As also  Aria WidÃºra    DratarÃ¡ja   and  KÃ©rna
   Then quickly before him did the  Aria  place
   Viands  served up in dishes of gold set with precious stones
       befitting the dignity of a prince

   29  Delighted was the mind of  KrÃ©sna
   When he saw the hospitable manner in which he was treated by the
        Aria  and by  BÃ­sma
   Then came the King of  AstÃ­na  to present him with dainties
   But his coming was fruitless  for  KrÃ©sna  would have none of them
       spurning the offer

   30  On which the King of the  KurÃ¡wa   addressing the blessed among
       men 166  in an angry tone thus spoke
    O  thou pure among men  who lovest to over rate thyself
    Disdaining to receive the proffered food which I prepared for thee
    It is not fit that thou shouldst be numbered among the good and
       worthy of the earth

   31  Such were the words of the King of the  KurÃ¡wa  addressed to
        KrÃ©sna
   To whom  in reply  the latter said   Being deputed by others
    To accept of the articles presented to me by thee  would be as if I
       were to take poison
    Not having yet finished the work I am come about



   28  Ka drona bisma krepa salya kapanggi arpat
   Lawan sang arya widura drata raj ya karna
   Sig ran sumung akni kang pasaji nararya
   Bogo paboga saha mas mani raj ya yog ya

   Mojar janardana t her puri ing kinongkon
   Tan sambramÃ© pang upakara ritap waning don
   Apan mamukti wisa rak wana sida karaya



   32  So spake the pure among men  losing for a moment the character of
       a  PandÃ­ta
    KrÃ©sna  then returned home  followed by his principal  MÃ¡ntrÃ­  167
   And on reaching his residence he immediately kissed the feet of the
       wife 168  of  PÃ¡ndu
   Who very graciously and kindly received the honour done her

                       Measure  Bangsa patra

   33  As soon as  BatÃ¡ri Kunti  169  perceived  KrÃ©sna  approaching
   Her mind suddenly expanded  like an opening flower  but immediately
       after became oppressed with grief
   Then addressing the royal youth  she said  his coming to her was as
       welcome as that of the  PandÃ¡was
   She then quickly threw her arms round the neck of the well pleased
        KrÃ©sna

   34  And immediately told him of all the sad grief and consequent shame
       which filled her mind
   With a choked utterance and a strenuous effort to suppress the rising
       tear
    O  my friend and protector   said she   thou bringest consolation and
       comfort to my breaking heart
    Making me feel as happy as if I were at this moment in the delightful
       company of all the sons of  PÃ¡ndu

   35  Such were the words of the great  Dewi Kunti   causing  KrÃ©sna  to
       shed tears
   To whom the latter  in reply  thus spake   Grieve not  oh princess
    What is  has been ordained by the Almighty  whose humble instrument I
       am
   Thus said  he forthwith returned  and went to the palace of
        WÃ¡ra widÃºra

   36  Leaving  KrÃ©sna  to the hospitable entertainment of  WidÃºra   who
       administered to all his wants
   Let us proceed to speak of the King of the  KurÃ¡wa
   Whose gifts had been disdainfully rejected
   And who thereby was sorely vexed

   37  He consulted with  DusasÃ¡na  and  SakÃºni  upon the subject
   But the first on the list of advisers were  KrÃ©pa  and  KÃ©rna   They
       wishing to kindle the ire of the king of  KurÃ¡wa
   Asked   Why should you be afraid to refuse giving up half of the
       country
    On account of  KrÃ©sna s  being the friend and ally of the  PandÃ¡wa



   35  Na wuwus ira su dÃ©wi kunti KrÃ©sna saha tang is

   38   Therefore it is that the offered food was so much slighted
    If not accepted of  by  KrÃ©sna   care not  but give it away elsewhere
    Be the enemies of our leader who they may  our bweapons are ready
   Having thus said   KrÃ©pa  and  KÃ©rna  departed  and were followed by
        DusasÃ¡na  and  SakÃºni

   39  All having departed  and gone home
   The king of the  KurÃ¡wa   alone and sad
   Went to the apartment of his wife
   Who was said to be exquisitely beautiful  even exceeding the females
       of heaven  and containing more sweetness than a sea of honey

   40  When he reached the place where his wife was  he spoke not  but
       continued silent
   Oppress d with grief  and lost to every thing
   In this mood he remained  till the coolness of evening came  and
   The sun shone bright in the west

   41  The sun about to disappear  looked as if descending into the bosom
       of the deep
   And cast a beautiful and pleasing appearance on the palace
   But it assumed all at once a pale and sombre aspect
   While the women within were happy and joyful



   38  Niha niki teka panian sampa Ã© ke pasaji aji
   Tarimanen niki ay  wang kewÃ©ra mÃ©tukaraken

42 46   Description of the loves of both sexes  and the graces and
attractions of women

47 50   Moonlight scene described  with the sports and blandishments of
the maids of the palace

51 53   The maids of  AstÃ­na  continue to talk and amuse themselves by
the light of the moon

54   Midnight follows  when all are at rest  and a solemn stillness
prevails  disturbed only by the  Bramins  proclaiming the midnight
hour

55 63   Description of morning  Sunrise   c

64 66    SuyudÃ¡na   king of  KurÃ¡wa   comes forth in state into the
hall of audience to meet  KrÃ©sna   who has been waiting for him there
along with many princes and chiefs of the place

67 73    KrÃ©sna  announces to  SuyudÃ¡na  the object of his mission
viz  to ask for half the kingdom of  AstÃ­na  for the  PandÃ¡wa
c  The father and mother of  SuyudÃ¡na  and all the old and grave
PandÃ­tas  recommend compliance with the proposal of the  PandÃ¡wa   in
order that there may be an amicable adjustment of affairs   KÃ©rna
DusasÃ¡na    SakÃºni   and  KrÃ©pa   shake their heads  in token of their
disapprobation of the measure  and evince their readiness to attack and
kill  KrÃ©sna  on the spot

                          Measure SekarÃ­ni

   74  Then the servant  SatÃ­Ã¡ki  related to  KrÃ©sna  from his own
       knowledge
   That at the time the plan of  DuriodÃ¡na  was to take away his life
   For he had collected together and assembled his people in arms
   Whereupon  KrÃ©sna  issued orders for his forces to be in like manner
       assembled



                          Tembang Sekarini

   74  SamÄngkÄ yoda sÄ tiaki majari sÄng   KrÄ“sna saduga

                       Measure BasÃ¡nta tilÃ¡ka

   75   KrÃ©sna  then giving way to his anger  arose from his seat
   His passion swelling and rising within him like unto the fury of the
       god  KÃ¡la
   His speech no longer soft  was harsh and loud  and he represented the
       all powerful  WÃ­snu  170
   His appearance uniting the force of the three powers and of the three
       worlds

   76  From his shoulders were seen to extend four arms  and above them
       were three heads and three eyes 171
   The power and divinity of every deity now entered into his person
    BrÃ¡ma   the saints  the powerful deities  the chiefs of the
        RasÃ¡ksas
   With the power of all the people and chiefs of the immaterial world
       and of all that possessed power

   77  Then swaying his body from side to side  and breathing hard like
       the roar of a lion
   The earth shook to its base  disturbing the foundation of every thing
   The mountain tops nodding  and the mountains themselves rocking to and
       fro
   The waves of the sea rising like mountains  forming whirlpools and
       casting the deep sea fish on the adjacent shore



                   Tembang Basanta tilaka   See 26

   75  Angka kroda Kresna mang adÄ•k sakaring pahman
   Mong ging natar sira wibuh Kadi Kala merchu

   77  Yekan lumangka asigap kraka singha nada
   Lindu tikang siti pado lawa ng ambek Kambek
   Yang parwoto gra gumiwang manawang ginanjuh
   Kombak wayi tasi kanyakra panyunya kabeang



   78  In an instant fear and panic overspread the hundred  KurÃ¡wa
   Silent and speechless they stood  and with a pale and wan look  which
       extended to the prince  KÃ©rna  himself
   Even  SÃºyudÃ¡na  and  YuyÃºtsu  lost their senses from fear
   They remained as without life  and having no will of their own

   79  It was then that  DrÃºna  and  BÃ­sma   and the good  PandÃ­ta
       NarÃ¡da
   Offered prayers and praise  and sprinkling a shower of sweet scented
       flowers before him
   Thus entreated   Are you not  in truth  the God of Day  why become
       greater
    Have mercy upon the world and all that it contains

   80   If you resolve upon the destruction of  KurunÃ¡ta   his
       destruction must ensue
    But think once more of the agreement of  NahÃ¡ria BÃ­ma
    And of the pledge of  DrupÃ¡di   who has vowed not to bind her hair
    Until she shall have bathed in the blood of the hundred  KurÃ¡wa

   81  At this the god relented  and his heart became softened
   When he listened to the words of the holy  BÃ­sma
   For the wisdom of  KrÃ©sna  was pleased with the praise
   And in an instant he resumed the form of  NahÃ¡ria KrÃ©sna



   78  Tanduan kawus gatini kang sata Kurawa ras
   Diem tan pasÃ¡bda mawenes Narepa Karna Nata
   Mangkang Suryodana Yuyutsu Wikarna morcha
   Biak tan geseng tekap irang arepi ilangnia

   79  Ng ka Druna Bisma ng uniwÃ© resi Narada di
   Asrang mang astuti umong saha puspa warsa
   Mojar Batara hari ayowa magung weyung ta
   S wasta nikang Buana kasihi tulihenta

   80  Yedian kita mejahani kurunata nang ga
   Bahna pratitnia gati sang Prawaria Bima
   Moang Dropadi basa matan pag lung gatinia
   Yen tan pakadiusa rirah sata kuraweng prang

   81  Da kantananya lesunen poa geleng Batara
   Ling sang watak resi lawan paramarsi Bisma
   Karunya budi nira Kresna renan pinuja
   Rap saksana noluya rupa Nararia Kresna



   82  The  PandÃ­tas  then went each his way
   And  KrÃ©sna  proceeded to the dwelling of the widow of  PÃ¡ndu
   No sooner was he arrived than he said   I offered my advice to the
       princes of  KÃºra
    But they have resolved to be destroyed in battle

   83   Such  O  NaranÃ¡ti DÃ©wi   is the conduct of  KurunÃ¡ta
   To him the princess then replied   Inform my sons  the sons of
        PÃ¡ndu   of this
    And since they must fight  let them select warriors who cling to life
    And let  SwÃ¡rga  receive those who may fall in the war

   84  Thus spake the princess to  NahÃ¡ria KrÃ©sna
   Who closing his hands in respect  requested to withdraw
   Then quickly mounting his resplendent chariot
   He was followed by  WidÃºra    SanjÃ¡ya   and  YuyÃºtsu

   85   KÃ©rna  alone was seated in the chariot by the side of  KrÃ©sna
   And him he advised to follow the cause of  PÃ¡ndu
   But the Prince of  WÃ¡ng ga  replied   I hold to my resolve
    And long to try my strength in battle against  KirÃ­ti



   82   Ngka tant tinut nira muli resi sangga suksma
   Sang Kresna mantuk kumari sira Pandu Patni
   Sigran teka jari wiang nira Kura wendra
   Kewalia mayun nirikang rana matia ring prang

   84  Nahan wuwus narepa wadu Rinararia Kresna
   Yekan tinut nira napatgata semba amit

   Dan sang Nararia Riawang ga kedah sudira
   Mayon makola guna sakti lawan kiriti



   86  Such was the speech of  NarapÃ¡ti KÃ©rna   who would not hear but of
       war
    To the battle will I go  for I pant for war  and instant war
    In the fifth season  and on the first day of the moon  shall the war
       commence
    And ere the tenth night of  KrÃ©sna  shall it be terminated

   87   RawisÃºta  having thus declared himself in speech bold and fierce
   Requested to depart in company with  WidÃºra    SanjÃ¡ya   and  YuyÃºtsu
   And said not a word until he reach d his home
    JanardÃ¡na  gave speed to his course and went on

   88   NarapÃ¡ti KrÃ©sna  spoke not a word as he proceeded
   But  SrÃ­ KÃºnti   when she heard the intelligence
   Became sad at heart that her children should go to war
   And well she recollected what  KrÃ©sna   had formerly said

   89  This she thought should be the course of  NaranÃ¡ta KÃ©rna
   He should not listen to  KurunÃ¡ta   for he is bent upon war
   And thus she advised her son   Arka PÃºtra  172
   For she had borne him when yet a virgin



   86  Nahan wuwus Narapati Karnu wiyang tanamoas
   Metoeng ranang gana juga heng ujar neragia
   Mamui taneng kalima tuÃ© sedang tumanggal
   Rapuan Masampuna nipancha dasinia Kresna

   Tan warnanan Sira wuwus tekaring swa wisma

   88  Da titanen narapati KrÃ©sna sedang lumampa

   Sokan rasi wekan niran mijiling  ranang ga
   Ngu nin datang nerepati Kresna matakon ningdÃ©

   Motus kumona Kurunata tanagrah heng prang
   Kunti yaling nira mowa risang Arka putra
   Biak tan nanak nira ri kalaniran sukanya



   90  But  KÃ©rna  would not hearken  but averted his head
   His wish was that nothing should avert the war
   For he feared the loss of his character for courage
   And he had received great benefits from the princes of  KÃ³ra

   91  The widow of  PÃ¡ndu  then departed in grief
   And in silence bent her way to the abode of  SumÃ¡ntri
    JanardÃ¡na   meanwhile  continued his course
   Attended by  SatiÃ¡ki   the good and the brave

   92  So rapidly did the chariot go that the time could not be counted
   Till reaching  WirÃ¡ta   he met the assembled  PandÃ¡wa
   To them  KrÃ©sna  related  that the people of  AstÃ­na  rejected his
       advice
   And were resolved upon trying their prowess in war

   93  Transfix d with rage  the sons of the  PÃ¡ndu
    BÃ­ma    ArjÃºna    YenakÃºla   spoke with fierceness and defiance
   When they heard the words of  PÃ¡ndu PÃ¡tni
   That they should try their power and skill in war

   94  It was then that all the assembled princes
   Consulted and declared for war
   And  DrupÃ¡da  said to his son  the prince of  WirÃ¡ta
    Give orders and make ready the warlike implements  collect the chiefs
       and warriors



   90  Dan Kerna langana saha dara lot manamba
   Mang yang ritan wurunga ning mijiling ranang ga
   Kak satrian juga palai yuana ling ning raswi
   Apan kalindi anisih nira kora wendra

                          Measure SragdÃ¡ra

   95  At the dawn of day  the  PandÃ¡wa  arose and march d forth from the
       capital of  WirÃ¡ta
   Resplendent as the morning sun  when rising above the mountains  he
       first sheds his rays over the earth
   In numbers great  compact  and like an overwhelming sea  And a sound
       like distant thunder in the hills
   Was the sign  that the elephants  horses  and chariots  with the rich
       and splendid trappings of gold were in motion

   96  Many and numberless were the flowers scattered in clouds upon them
       by the  Pandita
   Loud was the sound of the martial strain  breathing victory and
       triumph to the sons of  PÃ¡ndu
   And when the flowers ceased to fall  there arose a strong wind  as if
       propitious to their march
   For the gods were assembled on high  and wished them success in the
       war



                          Tembang SragdÃ¡ra

   97  In the front of the march  BÃ­ma   the bold and the brave  took his
       station
   Wild with impatience for battle  and heedless of opposition
   He remained on foot  tossing his  gÃ¡da  into the air for amusement
   For he was accustomed to conquer  as well on the sea as on the
       mountains  and elephants and lions became his spoil

   98  In his rage he was all powerful as the elephant of the forest
   And now that he was in motion  he panted for the hostile chief  and
       gave the challenge aloud
   His voice being like the roar of the lion was heard by all
   The sound thereof resounding throughout the three worlds

   99  Behind him followed  ArjÃºna   seated in a splendid chariot of
       variegated gold  and shaded by a golden  pÃ¡yung
   Flaming like a burning mountain and threatening destruction on
        AstÃ­na  and its princes
   His banner  the monkey  floated high in the air  flapping the clouds
       in its course
   And as his retinue shone and glittered  lightning flashed with the
       thunder clap in presage of victory



   97  Pang anjur ning lu mampa sang ngino chapa ngaran Bima surang ga

   100  Next to  PalgÃºna  came  Aria NakÃºla   with  SedÃ©wa   mounted in a
       chariot of green of exquisite workmanship
   In beauty resembling two deities of heaven  and thirsting for the
       attack on the youths of  AstÃ­na
   They shone resplendent  Their banner floating in the air like a dark
       cloud threatening rain  and scattering the petals of sweet scented
       flowers
   Ready for the combat  as thunder before the lightning flash  and as
       they moved  the sound resembled the humming of bees in search of
       food

   101  Then slowly followed  Aria UtÃ¡ra   with  SoÃ­ta   alike mounted in
       a chariot of war
   And next  DrÃ¡sta driÃºmna  and  DrupÃ¡di   with  SikÃ¡ndi  by her side
   With countless chariots  elephants  and horses bringing up the
       cavalcade and filling up all space
   The whole elevated in spirit  as fish when enlivened by a sudden fall
       of rain

   102  And now appeared  DrupÃ¡di   borne on a litter of gold  and shaded
       with a  pÃ¡yung  of peacocks  plumes
   She was like a deity when represented by a golden image  her long hair
       hanging loose and floating in the wind
   She had not bound it  but while it hung like a low ring cloud  she
       awaited the coming of the rain of blood
   For she held to her vow  that until she bathed in the blood of the
       enemy  she would not collect her hair or tie the knot



   100  Wuntat Sang Palgunang Karia Nakula Saha dewa rata Jong bang un

   103  Then in her train followed  DÃ¡rma SÃºnu   mounted on a white
       elephant
   His attire complete  his  pustÃ¡ka  yellow  and the case of the purest
       gold
   Evincing that  DÃ¡rma MÃ³rtia  desired to slay  SÃ¡lia   the chief
       warrior of  DuriodÃ¡ning
   And that when he raised his  pustÃ¡ka  as an instrument of war  there
       was not his equal in power or courage

   104  Next  KrÃ©sna  advanced in his golden chariot  and shaded by a
       white  pÃ¡yung
   For it was his pleasure to bring up the rear  with the elder princes
       and the royal host
   Not far off were his  chÃ¡kra  and conch  and the princes of his
       retinue were borne on white elephants
   The cry of the elephants rose loud and high  uniting with the mingled
       sounds which issued from all quarters

   105  Behind  KrÃ©sna  came  BimÃ¡nyu   the son of  ArjÃºna
   With his instruments of war  borne in a splendid chariot  studded with
       precious stones  and playing with his  chÃ¡kra
   With him was  SatiÃ¡ki   seated on an elephant  and accompanied by
       numerous followers
   Richly adorned with golden vests  the surprise and admiration of all
       beholders



   103  Lila Sri DÃ¡rma sunu miring ngakaning sira nong ganing mata Hasti

   106  And then came on the two sons of the  PandÃ¡wa    PanchawÃ¡la   and
        WÃ­tia
   Complete in their habiliments  and mounted in a war chariot
       ornamented with gems and flowers of gold
   Their dress of linen and of silk  A delightful fragrance surrounded
       them
   Beautiful was their  pÃ¡yung   for it was of the wings of the
        mardukÃ¡ra   and dazzled the eye like the glare of the sun

   107  Many and various were the characters and attributes of the
       different warriors hastening to their work  were they all to be
       described
   Arrived at  KuruksÃ©tra   they soon raise a fort of very great strength
   And the palace built therein being finished  they invite the wife of
        PÃ¡ndu
   Who quickly arrives  and enters the palace  accompanied by  WidÃºra

   108  Then  WidÃºra  went back  and safely reached her home
   While  DÃ©wi NÃ¡ta  and all the sons of  PÃ¡ndu   met together with
       mutual delight
   And discoursed in turn of the hardship of her being incessantly
       obliged to retreat to the hills
   The more she poured out her grief  the greater was the joy that
       followed  even to shedding tears

   109  Long would it take to relate all the pleasure felt by the wife of
        PÃ¡ndu  while in the interior of the palace
   Then all the  PandÃ¡wa   together with  KrÃ©sna   the first and the
       mightiest  with many other chiefs  debated
   Who was the fittest  from his knowledge of military positions  to be
       elected  SÃ©na dÃ­pa  173
   As one of undoubted ability and skill in managing an army

   110   DÃ©rmat mÃ¡ja   addressing  KrÃ©sna  and all the assembled chiefs
       then said
    Seven only out of all the number appear to be fit to hold the chief
       command
    Of the army  which consists of seven hundred millions of fighting men
    And first of these  SoÃ©tan  174   skilled in the direction of
       soldiers



   109  Tange yan warnanan tustane mana ira sang pandu patne aning jero
   Sigra hem sang watek pandawa maka muka sang Kresna len partiwa kweh
   Rehning sena dipa ring samara ya ginonem sang  wru ing byu a durga

    Ngka sang so etan pinuja wuruha ri gelara ning sura yoding ranang ga

                          Measure SuandÃ¡na

   111  Whilst all the  PandÃ¡wa  were appointing chiefs over the army
    Narapati KurÃ¡wa  175  held a council of war
   For he had heard of the arrival of many enemies at  Kuruk sÃ©tra  176
   It was  Aria WidÃºra  who gave him the intelligence

   112  Then  PrÃ¡bu GajawÃ¡yan  177  marched forth with all his chiefs
   All the  KurÃ¡wa   too  were in company  making a noise as they moved
       along  like the roaring of the sea
   In the neighbourhood of the hostile plain they construct a place of
       strength
   Soon was the work completed  for the  Narapati s  authority extended
       over all the princes around

   113  Then was  Aria BÃ­sma  first made a leader in battle
   Raised above all others  he is seen crowned with flowers
   From all quarters the crowded and restless multitude send forth shouts
   While the sound of  gongs  and  conchs  rend the skies



                          Tembang SuÃ¡ndana

   111  SedÄ“ng mang abisekÄ   brÄtya pati sÄng   watÄk PÄndawa
   UlÄ nerepati kÅ rawÄ“ swara na hÄ“m   pirÄ“ng ng wÄ kena

   112  Rika prabu gajahwayan laku lowan watek partiwa
   Sakorawa marempaka tri gumuruh bangun sagara
   Akarya kuta durga meh tegalika pradÃ©seng kuru
   Wawang  uwusa pan sirang nerepati chakra warting sarat

   113  Samang kana sang arya Bisma pinaka gra sÃ©napati
   Katone nabisÃ©ka sampuna sekar sira busana
   Penuh pas luring prawira masurak masang garuhan
   Lawan Pada ibera sangka tinolup umong ring langit



   114  Next all the princes and chiefs are regaled
   The troops and followers have all they want  and are provided with
       conveyances
   The length of one line was twelve millions one hundred thousand
   While the thronged legions extended to the hills and to the woods

   115  Then altogether they set out for the field of battle
   Moving towards the west  and leaving their strong hold and the king of
        AstÃ­na  behind
   Arrived on the hostile plain  loud resounded the  conchs
   While the warriors  animated by the sound  testify by their actions
       and gestures  their impatience to engage in the fight

   116  At the same time they are formed in battle array on the hostile
       plain
    RÃ¡wan  was the name of the order which was first founded by the king
       of the  PandÃ¡wa
   That of king of the  KÃºru  was according to the wish of the  BramÃ¡na
   Who with all their relations swore they would conquer or die in the
       battle

   117  And now let us proceed to speak of the  PandÃ¡wa
   Having come out from their strong hold and arrived at the field of
       battle
   They advance eastward  towards the formed bodies of the  KurÃ¡wa
   Both sides shout and brandish their weapons in front of each other



   114  Tu e pwa niniwe watek ratu kabÃ© pinujakrama
   TekÃ©ng bala samoa yoda pada purna ring wahana
   Pinanding ngatarung wilenya sawelas gananya yuta
   Ya karanane kin penuh tekaring kawukir mwang wana

   115  Samang kana pareng mijil sakari kang tegal paprangan
   Mangula ana ngawuriakan kuta watek naropÃ© Astina
   TekÃ¨ng pag laran pada s ranga nulup sungo jerah pareng
   Ya Ã©tuni girang nikang bala kabÃ© pada ge a pranga

   116  Tu en pada t las makarya bisuwÃ©ng tegal paprangan
   Rawan ngarane kang tawur nereparti Pandawa morwane
   Kunang tawuri sang nerepÃ©ng Kuru yakari lut Brahmana
   Rikan sira sinapa sang du ija sagotra mati a laga

   117  Ri mangkana nikanda tochapa tasang watek Pandawa
   T las metu sakeng dalam kuta samipaneng panchaka
   Lumampa angawÃ©tan angarepaken g lar korawa
   Pada pranga ngawuh mangunda winawanya kapwa ngadeg



   118  Loud and confused were the mingled sounds of the armies
   The stoutest and bravest seemed to have been placed in front
   The only persons who did not engage in the fight were the musicians
       and standard bearers
   Those in front were seen prancing and nimbly moving about with their
       brandished weapons

   119  Quickly the contending armies mutually and fearlessly rush upon
       each other
   Amid the roar of elephants  the neighing of steeds  the beating of
       drums  and the shouts of the troops
   Till the whole air and sky is filled with the jarring sounds
   And the earth is shaken with the tumultuous din of war

   120   PrawÃ¡ra BÃ­sma  then formed his troops into the resemblance of
       the sea and mountains
   While the princes and chiefs of  AstÃ­na  seemed like towering and
       immovable rocks
   The warriors in front dashing upon the enemy like the waves of the sea
   And like the ocean bearing down before them stones as large as
       mountains



   118  Rikan pada gamoeanane sawateknia sawang pareng
   Sinangwo a sinilan risan mokane sang prawireng rana
   Ritan anane ngapranga mawa meredang ga tung gul kunang
   Lawan gatine kang katon mawusana regep sanjata

   119  Risampunera mangkanan dana pareng mase sehasa
   Umong swarane kang gaja kuda lawan gaber mwang surak
   Samantara ngati gurniteng langita monto ane dikvidik
   Gumetere lema nikang rana saba ketugnia selur

   120  Sireng Prawara Bisma sigra mag lar ukir sagara
   Watek ratu anÃ©ng gaja swa karangenya durga ruhur
   Pama gunong nganeng balamuka ngalun tuanut musuh
   Ya bano ani kagunturang gulunganeng sela marwata



   121   PrawÃ¡ra  178    PandÃ¡wa   formed the order of  bajÃ¡ra tÃ­ksna
       lÃºngit  179
    DananjÃ¡ya  180  and  WerkodÃ¡ra  181  were there with  SikÃ¡ndi  182
       in front
    WirÃ¡ta s  183  son   SatiÃ¡ki   and the son 184  of  DrupÃ¡da   were in
       the rear
    YudestÃ­ra  with all the princes being in the centre

   122  The mind of  ArjÃºna   when he viewed the enemy  was divided
       between joy and sorrow  and he was moved with love and pity
       towards them
   For they were chiefly composed of his own kindred
   Some of them were the sons of his father and mother  the younger and
       elder brother of his father were also there
   As also the  GÃºrus  185    Krepa    SÃ¡lea    BÃ­sma   and  DuijÃ©ng ga

   123  Therefore quickly addressing  NarÃ¡ria KrÃ©sna
   He intreated that the battle might not take place  being afflicted at
       the sight of the  KurÃ¡wa
   But  JanardÃ¡na  compelled him to command that the fight should begin
   It being dishonourable for men to hold back at the hour of battle



   121  Kuneng Prawara Pandawa g lari bajara tiksna lungit
   Dananjaya lawan Werakodara tomot S ikandi arep
   Wirata suta Satiaki Drupada sunu waktrÃ© wuri
   Yudistira lawan watek ratu kabÃ© mangantÃ©ng tenga

   122  Mulat mara sang Arjuna s mu kamanusan kas repan
   Ri tingka i mosu neran pada kadang taya wang waneh
    Ana wang anakeng yaya mwang ibu l en uwa go paman
   Makadi Krepa Salea Bisma sera sang Duijeng ga Guru

   123  Ya karananeran pasabda ri nararya Kresna teher
   Aminta wurunga laga pana welas tumon Kurawa
   Kuneng sira Janardana sekang a kon sarosa pranga
    Apan ilailang kasinatria surut yaning paprangan



   124  Then was seen  DÃ©rma pÃºtra  stealing away
   Towards  Aria    BÃ­sma    KrÃ©pa    SÃ¡lea   and  DÃºija
   With ardour he kissed and clung to their feet
   For it was customary  with  GÃºrus   to make obeisance to them before
       the battle

   125  Then spoke those who were thus made a brilliant object of
       adoration and respect
    Our noble child  suffer no uneasiness of mind  for you have already
       deprived us of life
    Child of ourselves  may you be successful in battle and soon obtain
       possession of the country
    And may  NarapÃ¡ti KrÃ©sna  witness the truth of our words

   126  This done  he forthwith returned to his own side
   Quickly ascending his chariot and laying hold of his weapons
   While each sounded his  conch
   And various were the sounds of the  kÃ©ndang  and its accompaniments

   127  Instant the contending armies rush upon each other  mingling
       together in long  obstinate  and close fight
   Ten elephants to a chariot  and ten horses to an elephant
   These ten horses being mounted by such as fear not to die in battle
   And their duty being to watch when they can cut up and exterminate the
       enemy



   124  Caton pwa sira Derma putra mangenes rika tan tumut
   Mare sira sang Arja Bisma Kropa SalÃ©a len sang Duija
   Masocha ri sukunera nenabi wada dÃ© sang prabu
    Apan purihi ngang lawan Guru mapur wa pujan arep

   125  Kunang sa uri sang kinarya pinaka gra chudamane
   Bapangku laki ayo a sang saya uripku ta lap huwus
   Kita naku jayÃ©ng ranang gana teher madre wi a pura
   Sirang Nerepati Kresna saksi a yadi an merosa ringwuwus

   126  Ri sampunera mangkana dan nomalia marÃ©ng paprangan
   Kasana krama numung ga ing rata pada regep sanjata
   Sahasa manulup risangka nera so angan nya  umung
   Pareng mo ang ngonening gubar saragi kotÃ© kotia nguwuh

   127  Wawang pamuki kang bala s ranga selur mawenta jemur
   RatÃ©ka sapulu gajanya gaja tung gul aswa dasa
   KudÃ©ka sapulu pada tinika sura mantÃ©ng laga
   Kenohnya  ana pada raksaka yadin wisirnan winuk



   128  The number of the chiefs who were mounted on elephants
   Were a thousand millions  those that accompanied them were ten and one
       thousand billions
   Those on horseback amounted to one billion  while they that followed
       were ten billions
   Great therefore was the battle and many were the slain

   129  Many days did the  KurÃ¡wa  oppose the  PandÃ¡wa
   Soon fell the brave sons of  WirÃ¡tes SwÃ¡ra
   He named  Wira SÃ¡ngka  was slain by  Duija
      Dea Utra  fell by the hand of  NarapÃ¡ti SÃ¡lea   the hero in battle

   130  Enraged at the fall of these two heroes   SoÃ©ta  186
   Rushed like a mountain on ten billions of the foe
   A shower of arrows at once destroyed the chariot of  NÃ¡ta SÃ¡lea   and
       carried death to many of the brave
    SÃ¡lea  himself and his charioteer narrowly escaping with their lives

   131  The whole army of the  KorÃ¡wa  hastened to his support
   Amongst them were seen  BÃ­ma    DrÃ³na    WÃ©rahat bÃ¡la   and  JÃ¡ya
        SÃ©na   armed with their clubs
    RukmarÃ¡ta   too  the son of  NarapÃ¡ti SÃ¡lea   supporting his father
   Soon did  Ari SoÃ©ta   powerful as a lion  make them feel his
       superiority



   128  Aneka tekaping wibaga yan sangsÃ©na dulur
    Anun saka sapanti len sapretana sagulmÃ© naseh
   Dudung merang ngaturang ga ara sachamo mwang ngakso eni
   Ya karanane kang prangat buta magenturan sek pejah

   129  Pirang dina kuneng lawas kurukula lawan pandawa
   Datando a ana sura mati uka sang wirates swara
   Prakasa wara sangka namanera mati de sang Duija
   Dea utara paraptra de nerepati salea sureng rana

   130   Ngka sweta numasa masungeti pejaneng sura kali pisan
   Sigran tandang  amagunung saha bala  ngamba teka eksoeni
   Yekan s yu rata nata salea pinana mwang wira yodan pejah
   Tambis mÃ©h sira matia karwa kerta warma pan makarwan rata

   131   Ngkan pinrih tinulung tekap nera watek yoda aning korawa
   Bisma drona lawan werahat bala jayat sena dulur ma gada
   Mwang sang rukmaratat maja nerepati salea nimbangi gang yaya
   Datando an kawenang tekap nera sang arya so Ã©ta singot  tama



   132   DÃ­nang RukmarÃ¡ta  fell and lay prostrate on the seat of his
       carriage
    SoÃ©ta  fought furiously and killed many of the  KurÃ¡wa
   None would face him  but all fled in terror
   Great too was their dread of  GÃ¡tut kÃ¡cha    DrupÃ¡da s  son  and
        KirÃ­tiatmÃ¡ja

   133  Then  RÃ©si BÃ­sma  rapidly advancing opposed the furious attack of
       all the  PendÃ¡wa
   Aiming at  SoÃ©ta  he unceasingly shot the best of his sharp arrows
   But  SoÃ©ta   the commander in battle  unhurt  grew more and more
       courageous  and shot his arrows in turn
    BÃ­ma  and  DananjÃ¡ya  came to his aid  their arrows poured like a
       shower of rain from the heavens

   134  The King of the  KurÃ¡wa  advancing  no sooner came upon  BÃ­ma
       in the middle of the field of battle
   Than he suddenly stopped and started backwards  making a precipitate
       retreat  running and falling  and stopping not till he had got to
       a great distance
   But  BÃ­sma   intent only on  BÃ­ma   maintained an incessant attack
       which  BÃ­sma   standing up in his carriage  watched and repelled
   While  BÃ­sma  was greatly exasperated against  WirÃ¡ta tinÃ¡ya   for his
       attempt to exterminate the  KurÃ¡wa



   132  Dinangrukmaratan peja magulingan  ngkane salening rata
   Sang so Ã©tan lurugen pamok nira mating yoda aneng korawa
   Mangkin sirna luyuk datan ana mulat kapwa kukud atakut
   Tekwan wira gatot kacha drupada putra mwang kiriteat maja

   133  Yekang so resi bisma sigra mapulih mok wok watik pandawa
   Sang so Ã©tan dinunong neran pamana in diwi estra teksna susun

   134   Ngkan mangsa kurunata sigra pinapag dÃ© bima ring sayaka
   Kang gek mundura ngong gutung guta layu mung gwÃ©ng kado an kawes
   Ang ing bisma lineksa pinri inerup stira ngadeg ring rata
   DÃ©ra kroda risang wirata tanaya ndÃ© sirnaning korawa



   135  Then  alarmed   WirÃ¡ ta sÃ¡ta   the leader of the  PandÃ¡wa
   Shot one of his best arrows at him  the tiger of the  KurÃ¡wa
   The flight of the arrow resembled that of the bird  garÃºda
   And striking the shoulder of  DÃ©wa brÃ¡ta  broke it into seven pieces

   136  On this  WirÃ¡ta tanÃ¡ya  alighting and laying hold of a large club
       of iron
   Would have struck  SÃºra brÃ¡ta  therewith on the side of his head  but
       he leaping from his chariot avoided the blow
   Destroyed  however  was his carriage  and slain were the horses and
       charioteer
   And the death of many elephants and chiefs ensued

   137  Terrified at the sight of  WiratamÃ¡ja    WÃ¡ra BÃ­sma  would have
       fled in dismay
   When a voice from heaven told him that the hour for  SoÃ©ta  to die was
       come
   Whereat encouraged  he talked boldly  and seizing a chariot and arrows
   He aimed at the heart of  SoÃ©ta  with the sharp pointed weapon of
       fire 187



   135  MangkÃ©n garjita sang wirata suta sÃ©na nata ring pandawa
   Mandug ring wara tomarÃ© sanga ngaran santana wagrÃ©ng kuru
    Ngkan pinri pinana sedeng niki numur lir naya rotang layang

   Nahan Ã©tunira ebang ebang nanbut sing rata mwang panah
   Prana so eta tikang minusti nera ring b hramastra tiksna lungit



   138  Quickly pierced through the heart   Sang WirÃ¡ta SÃ¡ta  fell
       lifeless on the ground
   Grieved and distressed were the  PandÃ¡wa  thus to see  SoÃ©ta  killed
       on the field of battle
   Not so the hundred  KurÃ¡wa   who shouted with joy when their enemy
       perished
   While  Sang DusÃ¡sÃ¡na  danced fantastically  delighted with the sight
       of the fallen  WirÃ¡tamja



   138  Tandu a trus dada sang wirata suta mar murcha tiba ring lemah
   Yekan soka sang pandawa lara tumon sang soÃ©ta matia laga
   BÃ©da mwang sata kurawa surakawur arse peja ning mosu
   Sang dusasana tusta mata mangegel yan ton wiratat maja

139   Vexed and enraged at the death of his son   MÃ¡ngsah PÃ¡ti  makes
a furious and desperate attack upon the enemy  The  PandÃ¡wa   too
heedless of their lives  join and support him

140 144   The followers of  BÃ­sma  are routed and pursued with great
slaughter  Night comes on  hostilities cease  and the contending armies
respectively withdraw   MangsÃ¡h PÃ¡ti  and his wife weep over the dead
bodies of their three sons slain in battle  and lament their misfortune
in losing them   they shake them and endeavour to call them to life

145   They then burn the dead bodies on the field of battle by the
light of the moon

146 147   The  PandÃ¡wa  consult about the election of a fit person to
take the lead in battle   DrestadriÃºmna  is appointed  Morning arrived
the army of the  PandÃ¡wa  is formed into the terror inspiring order
of  kÃ¡geng pÃ¡teh   or that of the royal vulture  Situations of the
different princes and chiefs detailed

148 151    SuyudÃ¡na  causes the army of the  KurÃ¡wa  to be formed into
a similar order  The battle rages  The different chiefs  on either
side  who engage each other

152 153   The dust stirred up fills and darkens the air  The dust
clearing away  the field of battle appears like a sea of blood  in
which the carcases of elephants  horses  and men  with the fragments of
chariots  weapons   c  resemble so many rocks and stones

154 156    BÃ­sma  beheld with delight and admiration by all the chiefs
and people of  KurÃ¡wa   distinguishes himself by his prowess  He
engages  ArjÃºna   and shoots ten arrows for every one discharged by
him

157    RÃ¡wan   the son of  ArjÃºna   is killed by the  RasÃ¡ksa
SÃ©reng gi

158 159    KrÃ©sna   enraged at  BÃ­sma   descends from his chariot and
is going to shoot at him  when  BÃ­sma  evinces his ready willingness to
be killed by  KrÃ©sna s chÃ¡kra   and so gain admittance to his heaven

160    ArjÃºna  then descends from the chariot  and dissuades  KrÃ©sna
from killing  BÃ­sma

161    KrÃ©sna  and  ArjÃºna  both re ascend the chariot  while  BÃ­sma
remains deprived of all his strength  in consequence of the fright he
had undergone

162 164    BÃ­sma  makes a sign to  DÃ©rma WÃ¡ngsa   who recollecting
that the former had made a surrender of his life to  ArjÃºna  and
S ri kÃ¡ndi   goes to them and tells them not to be afraid  but to
shoot at  BÃ­sma   whereupon  S ri kÃ¡ndi  discharging an arrow  hits him
in the breast  The arrow not having penetrated far   ArjÃºna  shoots
and drives it home with another arrow   BÃ­sma  falls down in the
chariot but is not killed  His blood ascending to the regions above  is
converted into flowers  and in that form returns to the earth

165   The  KurÃ¡wa  fly and are pursued by the  PandÃ¡wa

166 167    DÃ©rma WÃ¡ngsa    ArjÃºna    NakÃºla   and  SedÃ©wa   all go and
kiss the feet of the respected  BÃ­sma   but the haughty and unbending
BÃ­ma  remaining in an angry posture  makes no obeisance to the wounded
GÃºru   The  KurÃ¡wa  chiefs  with  SuyudÃ¡na  at their head  wish to
come up and bow respectfully before  BÃ­sma   but seeing the stern
BÃ­ma  they are afraid to approach

168   A truce takes place between the hostile chiefs  when all shew
their respect for  BÃ­sma   The  KurÃ¡wa  wish to place him upon a mat
but the  PandÃ¡wa  insist upon his litter consisting of arrows joined
together

169   The  PandÃ¡wa  withdraw  and the  KurÃ¡wa  alone are left in charge
of  BÃ­sma    BÃ­sma  refuses to take the water offered him in a vessel
by  SuyudÃ¡na   and calls to  ArjÃºna   who presents him with some in a
quiver

170 171    BÃ­sma  defers dying till the period of the sun s greatest
declination  which he reckons to be about seven months off

172    SuyudÃ¡na  appoints  Dangyang DrÃºna  commander in chief
whereupon it rains blood

173   The  KurÃ¡wa  are too uneasy in their minds to go to rest

174 177   The following morning they go to battle  Both armies are
formed into the order of battle called  gÃ¡ja   or the elephant
A furious engagement ensues  in which many are slain on either
side   ArjÃºna  destroys the order of the  KurÃ¡wa  army  is shot
by  BÃ¡gadÃ©ta   and afterwards brought to life again by medicines
administered by  KrÃ©sna   when he returns to the attack  and kills
BÃ¡gadÃ©ta  and the elephant he is on  Many of the  KurÃ¡wa  are killed
by  BÃ­ma  and  ArjÃºna

178   Night coming on the battle ceases  It was at the eighth
pÃ¡nglong   or about the twenty fourth  of the moon  The  PandÃ¡wa
regale themselves  while the  KurÃ¡wa  lament the death of  BÃ¡gadÃ©ta

179 181    Dangyang DrÃºna  undertakes to kill  DÃ©rma WÃ¡ngsa   provided
ArjÃºna  and  BÃ­ma  are out of the way  Ten  KurÃ¡wa  chiefs  with
TrigÃ©rta  at their head  draw away  ArjÃºna  to fight against them to
the south of the hills  ten more  under  DrÃ¡ta PÃºra   draw off  BÃ­ma
in a similar manner  to the north of the hills   KrÃ©sna   as usual
accompanies and watches over the safety of  ArjÃºna

182 185    Dangyang DrÃºna  forms his men into the order  chÃ¡kra bÃºhia
or that of the circle with a well defended entrance    DÃ©rma
WÃ¡ngsa   in his perplexity what to do  calls upon  BimÃ¡nyu   the son
of  ArjÃºna   to attack and break the order of the enemy   BimÃ¡nyu
decoyed by  SuyudÃ¡na   pursues him into the ring purposely formed by
the enemy  when it closes  and he is cut off from all assistance and
support from the  PandÃ¡wa

186 194    BimÃ¡nyu  kills  LeksÃ¡na kumÃ¡ra   the son of  SuyudÃ¡na   but
is overpowered by the number of the enemy  His situation is described
by many similes  He is slain

195 196   Night comes on and hostilities cease

197 199   The effect which the death of  AbimÃ¡nyu  produces on his wife
DÃ©wi SundÃ¡ri   She adorns and prepares to burn herself with the corpse
of her husband

200   His other wife   UtÃ¡ri   being eight months gone with child  is
deprived of this honour

201 205    BÃ­ma  and  ArjÃºna  return victorious from their respective
engagements  The latter is angry with  DÃ©rma WÃ¡ngsa   for having caused
the death of his son  but is appeased by  KrÃ©sna   and induced to treat
the old man with respect   DÃ©rma WÃ¡ngsa  explains how  AbimÃ¡nyu s
death was occasioned by  JÃ¡ya DrÃ¡ta s  preventing the  PandÃ¡wa  from
entering the ring of the enemy  and from his defending it so well
ArjÃºna  vows vengeance against  Jaya DrÃ¡ta   and hopes that he himself
may be killed and burned  if he does not on the following day send him
to the other world

206 207    JÃ¡ya DrÃ¡ta  advised of  ArjÃºna s  intentions  begs of
SuyudÃ¡na  to be allowed to withdraw from the field of battle
Dangyang DrÃºna   upon this  upbraids him  and persuades him to remain
and try his hand against  ArjÃºna   promising to support him

208 211    ArjÃºna  and  KrÃ©sna  consult together how  JÃ¡ya DrÃ¡ta  may
be killed  and  KrÃ©sna  himself escape

212 213   For this purpose  KrÃ©sna  makes  ArjÃºna  purify himself and
offer up prayers to the  BatÃ¡ra    BatÃ¡ra SÃ¡kra  descends  and informs
ArjÃºna  that he will succeed in killing  JÃ¡ya DrÃ¡ta   if he only makes
use of the arrow called  pasopÃ¡ti   and then vanishes

214 228   The two wives of  AbimÃ¡nyu  talk much together of the death
of their husband  Their different situations and feelings  Their
separation  and meeting again under various forms   c   after which
SundÃ¡ri  burns herself with the body of  AbimÃ¡nyu

229 231   With the rising sun  the  PandÃ¡wa  chiefs   c  repair to the
field of battle  where they find the  KurÃ¡wa  forces drawn up in the
order  chÃ¡kra bÃ¡hui   with  JÃ¡ya DrÃ¡ta   for safety s sake  in the
centre

232   The diameter of the circle formed by the enemy round  JÃ¡ya
DrÃ¡ta   is ten times the distance at which men can be distinguished by
the eye

233 235   The  PandÃ¡wa  observe the same order of battle  and attack
the  Kurawa   Both armies mingle in close and obstinate fight

236 237   The  PandÃ¡wa  being oppressed with thirst   ArjÃºna  strikes
an arrow into the earth  whereupon water springing forth  men and
beasts drink and are refreshed

238 240    KrÃ©sna  makes  ArjÃºna  shoot at  SuyudÃ¡na   whose chariot is
thereby broken to pieces  and his charioteer and horses killed  himself
narrowly escaping with his life   ArjÃºna  and his men fight furiously
and kill many of the enemy

241 244    Satiaki  kills  TuyasÃ¡da    KambujÃ¡na   and  Sang AmbisÃºki

245 252    BÃ­ma  kills  Chitra YÃºda    JÃ¡ya SusÃ©na    ChÃ¡ruchÃ­tra
DurjÃ¡ya    JÃ¡ya ChÃ­tra SÃ©na    ChÃ­traka    Sangupu ChÃ­tra Derma   and
nine more chiefs

253 257    BurisrÃ¡wa  opposes  SatÃ­aki   They fight  and after their
weapons are broken  they close and wrestle   SatÃ­Ã¡ki  is on the point
of being killed  when  ArjÃºna   at the urgent request of  KrÃ©sna
discharges an arrow at  BurisrÃ¡wa   which  breaking his arm  causes him
to drop the weapon with which he was going to kill  SatiÃ¡ka   While
BurisrÃ¡wa  and  ArjÃºna  are expostulating with each other on their
respective conduct   SatiÃ¡ki  seizes the opportunity to dispatch the
former   BÃ­ma  and  ArjÃºna  slay thousands of the enemy  and endeavour
to get at  JÃ¡ya DrÃ¡ta   but are prevented by the numbers of the
KurÃ¡wa   who rush in between and try to save him

258 259   Seeing  BÃ­ma  and  ArjÃºna  tired and nearly exhausted
without the latter s being likely to effect the death of  JÃ¡ya DrÃ¡ta
within the promised time   KrÃ©sna  has recourse to an artifice  He
discharges his  chÃ¡kra  at the declining sun  whereupon the clouds
following the course of the weapon  collect round and obscure the
luminary  making it appear like night  The  KurÃ¡wa  thinking the fatal
day past on which  ArjÃºna  was to kill  JÃ¡ya DrÃ¡ta   triumphantly and
insultingly call out to  ArjÃºna  to fulfil his promise of meeting death
and being burned

260 262   Taking advantage of the darkness  and of the  KurÃ¡wa  being
off their guard   KrÃ©sna   accompanied by  ArjÃºna   wheels his chariot
past the  KurÃ¡wa   till he reaches the spot where  JÃ¡ya DrÃ¡ta  is
ArjÃºna  then shoots at  JÃ¡ya DrÃ¡ta   and kills him   JÃ¡ya DrÃ¡ta s
head being struck off by the arrow   KrÃ©sna  causes a wind to rise
and carry it to  JÃ¡ya DrÃ¡ta s  father  who was doing penance in the
mountains  in order to obtain of the gods  that if his son was killed
in the battle  he might live again  In his surprise at beholding the
head  he inadvertently exclaimed that his son was  dead   which sealed
his doom   KrÃ©sna  then recalled his  chÃ¡kra   whereupon the sun
again shone forth before it went down  Thus the vow of  ArjÃºna  was
fulfilled

263 264    SuyudÃ¡na  accuses  Dangyang DrÃºna  of being the cause of
JÃ¡ya DrÃ¡ta s  death  in not suffering him to retire from the field of
battle when he wished to do so   Dangyang DrÃºna  defends his conduct
and uses high words to  SuyudÃ¡na

265 266    SuyudÃ¡na  invites  KÃ©rna  to go and attack  ArjÃºna    KÃ©rna
goes  and  SuyudÃ¡na  with his men follow

267 271   The sun sets and the battle continues  Enemies and friends
are with difficulty distinguished in the dark  and many of the latter
are killed by mistake

272 275    Sang Dwa jÃ¡ya rÃ¡ta   the adopted brother of  KÃ©rna   is
killed by  BÃ­ma    PratipÃ©ya  is on the point of killing  SangÃ¡
sÃ¡ng a   the son of  SatiÃ¡ki   but is prevented from doing so by
BÃ­ma   by whom he himself is slain  after having wounded  BÃ­ma

276   The sons of the  KurÃ¡wÃ¡  chiefs  exasperated at the death of
PratipÃ©ya   all fall upon  BÃ­ma   but are every one of them killed by
that potent hero

277   Three younger brothers of  Sakuni  are killed by  BÃ­ma

278 280    SuyudÃ¡na  talks with  KÃ©rna  of the carnage occasioned by
BÃ­ma  and  ArjÃºna    KÃ©rna  makes light of their power  and engages
to kill them both   KrÃ©pa  accuses  KÃ©rna  of being a boaster  and
intimates his inferiority in prowess to the two hostile heroes
whereupon they are going to fight with each other  when  SuyudÃ¡na
interposes and prevents them

281 284    KÃ©rna  attacks the  PandÃ¡wa  army and causes great havoc  A
consultation is held among the  PandÃ¡wa  respecting the fittest person
to oppose  KÃ©rna    KrÃ©sna  objects to  ArjÃºna s  doing so  as being
unskilled in fighting by night   Gatot KÃ¡cha   the son of  BÃ­ma   is
then selected to fight against  KÃ©rna

                       Measure  BasÃ¡nta lila

   285  Wherefore  Sang Gatot KÃ¡cha  was directed to seek the child of
       the sun
   By  KrÃ­sna  and  Parta   who complimented him for his superiority and
       power
   Quickly roused at the call  he presented himself with joy
   And said   Happy am I and fortunate  thus to be distinguished by his
       highness

   286   And so that I continue to serve the king according to my duty
    Let my body be severed to pieces  and death itself ensue
    However arduous the service required  I will nevertheless perform it
   At these words the advanced in years were struck dumb

   287  Thus spake  Sang Gatot KÃ¡cha   The heart of  KesÃ¡wa  failed
   So well did he know how to awaken tender feelings
   Therefore did the heart of his uncle melt away
   When he saw the boy daring enough to encounter the King of  AwÃ¡ng ga

   288  Therefore did  KrÃ©sna  and  Parta  remain speechless
   Moved with compassion  and grieved that they had thus called upon
        Gatot KÃ¡cha
   Instantly the hero hurried to the attack
   But as he was about to engage the child of the sun  he stopt short in
       terror



                        Tembang BasÃ¡nta lila

   285  Irika ta sang   gatot kacha kinon   mapag arka suta
   Teka pira kresna parta maneher   muji sakti nera
   Sang ngenojaran   wawang masemo garjita arsa marek
   Mawachana bege a yan ana pakon repatik nerepati

   286  Pakena neki lana marki jeng aji yugya neka
   Dadaha rikalaning baya aturnya matoa pati
   Kunenga paniwoa rahatane gate karya temen
   Situtua tan paneng ha menÃ© sigegen sakarang

   287  Na wuwusing sang gatot Kacha lumad ati Kesawa mar
   Tekapira yan weruh ujara ngalap maniking redaya
   Nguni nguni nalaning to a sira sang paman arda tenyu
   Molati rare neran lumawane sang awang ga pati

   288  Ya Karana Kresna parta mamuwue damenÃ© sakareng
   Asemo Kamanosan Kaluputan tekaping mangutus
   Kuneng iki sang gatot Kacha wawang sira sigra mase
   Mapagi pamok sang arka suta tando a nomandek ares



   289  Then all his potent arrows
   Issuing from his hands and from his mouth
   With celerity flew to the child of the sun  who overpowered in battle
   Gave way to the left  while the numerous torches of the  PandÃ¡wa  army
       shed their glare around



   289  Apitui sarwa sanjata wisesa yatas stranera
   Mijili tangan dudung mijili chang Kema nuta ngohuh
   Yata rumujak sang Arka suta KÃ©werana pinda jemor
   Muruda kiu mowa metu sulu bala pandawa bap

290 299    SialambÃ¡na   a blind  RasÃ¡ksa  chief  joins the  KurÃ¡wa
against  Gatot KÃ¡cha   by whom he is slain  whereupon his band of blind
RasÃ¡ksas  take to flight  Three other blind  RasÃ¡ksa  chiefs  with
separate bodies of blind  RasÃ¡ksas   successively oppose  Gatot Kacha
and share the same fate as the first

300 308    Gatot Kacha  fights with  KÃ©rna   flies  and is ultimately
killed by him

309 314   The  PandÃ¡wa   enraged at the death of  Gatot Kacha   all
fight with desperate fury   ArjÃºna  alone is restrained and withheld by
KrÃ©sna

315 321    Dowi Arimbi   the mother of  GÃ¡tot KÃ¡cha   burns herself on
the funeral pile of her son

322 334   The following morning  Dangyang DrÃºna   a  PandÃ­ta  on the
side of the  KurÃ¡wa   causes great havoc among the  PandÃ¡wa   to save
whom from the destruction which threatened them   KrÃ©sna  spreads
a false report of  AswatÃ¡ma s  death  and makes all the  PandÃ¡wa
proclaim it   Dangyang DrÃºna  hears and believes the rumour of his
son s death  and faints away  upon which  DrestadrÃ­umna  approaches him
and cuts his throat

335 343    AswatÃ¡ma  hearing that his father is killed  makes a furious
attack upon the enemy  but perceiving  BÃ­ma  is afraid and retires

344   The sun is about to set and hostilities cease

345 349   Description of the field of battle after the fight

350 351   The King of the  KurÃ¡wa  asks  KÃ©rna  to engage  ArjÃºna
KÃ©rna  agrees  but requests to have some one to attend and support him
in battle   SÃ¡lia  is selected and appointed for the purpose

352 356    KÃ©rna  and  SÃ¡lia   before they go to fight  go home to take
leave of their families   c  What passes on the occasion

357 365    KÃ©rna s  wife relates to her husband a dream she had  The
particulars of the conversation which takes place between them

366 393    DÃ©rma WÃ¡ngsa    KrÃ©sna   and  ArjÃºna   set out in the
night for the purpose of finding and putting together the head and
body of their respected  GÃºru    Dangyang DrÃºna   and in order to pay
due respect and homage to his remains  and to entreat forgiveness on
account of what had happened to him  Description of all they see and
meet by the way

394 407   Morning  The  PandÃ¡wa  prepare for battle

408 413   The  KurÃ¡wa  army is formed into the position
bÃ¡hui makÃ¡ra  188   or that of the prawn   KÃ©rna  in the mouth
DrumÃºka  in the right fore claw   Sakuni  in the left   SuyudÃ¡na  in
the head  all the princes and chiefs in the body

414 415   The  PandÃ¡wa  army is put into the order called
wÃºlan tumÃ¡nggal   or that of the new moon   ArjÃºna  forms the right
horn of the crescent   BÃ­ma  the left   DÃ©rma WÃ¡ngsa  and all the
princes and chiefs compose the centre

416 426    KÃ©rna  and  SÃ¡lia   mounted in one carriage  proceed to
the field of battle  The two contending armies engage  Their various
success described

427 440    BÃ­ma  attacks  upbraids  and pursues  SuyudÃ¡na   To save the
latter   DusasÃ¡na  fires an arrow at  BÃ­ma  and hits him   BÃ­ma  turns
about  and finding it was  DusasÃ¡na  that shot him  he seizes him by
the hair  and having called out to all the princes and chiefs to bear
witness to the fulfilment of his promise  he tears him in pieces and
drinks his blood

441 449   The battle continues to be fought with various success
sometimes one army giving way and sometimes the other

450 467    ArjÃºna  and  KÃ©rna  fight against each other  The arrows
shot by each at the other are immediately converted into various
elements or destructive animals   KÃ©rna  shoots rain   ArjÃºna  shoots
and dispels it   KÃ©rna  shoots fire   ArjÃºna  shoots rain and quenches
it   KÃ©rna  shoots dragons   ArjÃºna  shoots griffins which destroy
them

468 469    KÃ©rna  aims an arrow at the throat of  ArjÃºna   whom  SÃ¡lia
beckons to incline his head   ArdawilÃ­ka   a  RasÃ¡ksa   in the form of
a dragon  is killed by  ArjÃºna   while in the act of shooting at him

470 476    KÃ©rna  twice shoots at  ArjÃºna   but his arrow only strikes
and loosens his top knot of hair

477 479    ArjÃºna   invited and challenged by  KÃ©rna  to shoot at him
in his turn tells him  if he wishes to save his life to surrender
and pay obeisance   KÃ©rna  refusing to do this is shot in the throat
by  ArjÃºna   his head falls back into the chariot  On the death of
KÃ©rna   the child of the sun  that bright luminary grows dim with
grief  and expresses his deep sorrow by groans of thunder and showers
of tears  while his twinkling eyes emit incessant flashes of lightning

   479  Disheartened at the death of  KÃ©rna   the army of the  KurÃ¡wa
       take to flight
   And pursued by numbers  conceal themselves  out of fear  in holes and
       cavities
   The earth shakes  and at the same time a drizzling rain descending
       from the clouds  washes the blood stained corpse
   The evil portending cloud is seen  and the grumbling noise of thunder
       is heard

   480  Thus it was with him who died in the field of battle  Lost was
       the sweet expression of his countenance
   Shining were his polished teeth  and uplifted and still the black of
       his fixed eye
   No longer erect  his hair lay flat on his pale face  and frightful yet
       becoming was his severe wound
   Such is the appearance of the brave who die in battle



   479  Ri lina sri Karna lara laruti Kang Korawa bala
   Tinut ginreg muksÃ©ng wana Kateduning lo ah juranga res
   Pareng mwang lindu mega sumara riris rah sumarasah
   Kawanda lirning tÃ©ja patrÃ  keter wana tangisa

   480  Nian lir sang mating rana pada elang mwang manesira
   Waja nerang seidenta sepi irengi Kang nitra lumayep
   Alandung sang sri tang muka lalu Kuchem syu brana luwes
   Datanlen sang waneng baya mapalupu i ring rana saba

481 483   The  KurÃ¡wa  having taken to flight are pursued by the
PandÃ¡wa  into  AstÃ­na

484   Night coming on  the  PandÃ¡wa  return

485 489    SuyudÃ¡na  comments on the misfortune of the  KurÃ¡wa  in
losing  KÃ©rna   and consults about the fittest person to succeed that
hero

490 497   Advised by  SakÃºni    SuyudÃ¡na  asks  SÃ¡lia  to assume the
chief command

498 500    SÃ¡lia  endeavours to excuse himself  whereupon  AswatÃ¡ma
comes forward  and accuses him of being friendly to the  PandÃ¡wa   and
on that account unwilling to become the leader of the  KurÃ¡wa

501 502    AswatÃ¡ma  and  SÃ¡lia  quarrel and are going to fight  when
SuyudÃ¡na  interferes and draws  SÃ¡lia  away  exhorting him to take the
command

508 511    SÃ¡lia  at last consents  and then withdraws to his wife

512 516    NakÃºla  is sent by  KrÃ©sna  to  SÃ¡lia  to dissuade him from
fighting  Description of  SÃ¡lia s  palace

517 524   At sight of his nephew  NakÃºla    SÃ¡lia s  resolution fails
him  and he promises not to fight against the  PandÃ¡wa   He declares he
will readily and willingly surrender his life to  DÃ©rma WÃ¡ngsa   but to
no one else  and that that worthy person has only to make use of the
arrow called  pustaka akalÃ­ma asÃ¡da

525 527    NakÃºla  returns and informs  KrÃ©sna  and  DÃ©rma Wangsa  of
the success of his mission to  SÃ¡lia   and of all that passed on the
occasion

528 553    SÃ¡lia  relates to his wife  SÃ¡tia WÃ¡ti   the result of his
interview with  NakÃºla   and of his intention to sacrifice himself
whereupon she is grieved and sheds tears  Then follows a long and
detailed description of  SÃ¡tia WÃ¡ti   her person  manners  disposition
c   and the particulars of a conversation which takes place between
her and her husband  wherein they display great affection for each
other  after which they yield to the power of love  and then fatigued
with amorous dalliance  sink into each other s arms and fall asleep

554 556   In consequence of  SÃ¡tia WÃ¡ti s  declared determination to
accompany him   SÃ¡lia  steals from her when she is asleep  and having
got fairly away from her  he dresses himself without  and is honoured
by the  PandÃ­ta   who cast flowers upon him

559    SÃ¡lia  reaches the field of battle

560   The  PandÃ¡wa  army forthwith appears  and an engagement takes
place

561   The army of the  PandÃ¡wa  are hard pressed and obliged to fall
back

562 564    BÃ­ma  comes to their support and routs the enemy with great
slaughter

565 567    SÃ¡lia  deserted by his army remains alone  and as he
discharges his arrows they change into thousands of  RasÃ¡ksas
dragons  and evil spirits  which lighting among the enemy occasion
great consternation  whereupon  KrÃ©sna  ordering all the people to
throw down their weapons and fold their arms  the whole of the  demons
disappear without doing any harm

568 581   The good and quiet  DÃ©rma WÃ¡ngsa  is reluctantly persuaded by
KrÃ©sna  to save the  PandÃ¡wa  by killing  SÃ¡lia

582 583    DÃ©rma WÃ¡ngsa  discharges the arrow  pustÃ¡ka kalÃ­ma asÃ¡da
it penetrates and sticks in the breast of  SÃ¡lia   who immediately
dies

584 586   On the death of  SÃ¡lia  the  KurÃ¡wa  forces are routed and
pursued in all directions by the  PandÃ¡wa   with great slaughter

   587   SuyudÃ¡na  was on the point of being taken  but he bravely
       resisted
   And quickly bounding away in great alarm  he narrowly escaped with his
       life
   But  SakÃºnÃ©   trembling with fear  fell into the hands of the enemy
   And weeping  implored mercy  exclaiming   this is the reward of my
       kindness and hospitality



   587  Suyudana sireki meh kawananga takis lagawa
   Lumompata layu luput lepasa met urip katresan
   Tuwen sakuni sang sedeng ngkakatran kakesa graha
   Asambata nangis dine kwenargan buja sestawa



   588   Silence  thou vile and infamous dog
    With what restless labour hast thou sought to vex and offend me
    But now will I fail not to take my revenge
    Death shall seize thee  and great shall be thy torture

   589  Thus spake  BÃ­ma   and trampling him beneath his feet
   He thereby and with his  gÃ¡da  reduced to atoms the body of  SakÃºne
   The story goes  that he tore it in pieces  and sucking the blood
   Scattered them among the villages of the north and of the south

   590  The enemy being totally extinguished  filled was the field of
       battle with mountains of the slain
   While downward  in its deep bed  a sea of blood rolled with noisy rush
    SuyudÃ¡na  having escaped  there yet remained to seize him
   He is pursued and sought for  but cannot be found  having plunged in
       the water

   591  Abandoning their fruitless search after  SuyudÃ¡na   the five
        PandÃ¡wa  returning  homeward bend their course
    DÃ©wi SÃ¡tia WÃ¡ti  is then informed that  SÃ¡lia  had fallen in battle
   Aged and creditable persons  bowing respectfully  communicate to her
       the dire news
   Concealed amid the heaps of slain lay her lord  they alone escaped to
       tell the tale



   588  Ada nara neng tako ngasu kanistane chadama
   Datan werga weh laram beka ngupaya ri banchana
   Kunang nea tana lepatÃ© ki pamales kuh dukÃ© riko
   Ikang yama ngala pwapang idapana pwageng ning lara

   589  Nahan wachana bimasÃ©na tehera dedel sahasa

   Wanten bretya kaparchaya tuha yata jari sira teka namya torasih
   Dan rakweki dumenya tan pajaha sing lara ngeduku samendeming sawa



   592  The news quickly spreading  all the  GÃºrus  of the country weep
       on every side
   Trembling and distressed   DÃ©wi SÃ¡tia Wati  no longer retains the
       power of speech
   Blind with grief and with a heart full of sorrow  she reels and cannot
       stand
   Lost and insensible to all around  she seemed as if life itself had
       forsaken her

   594  Coming to herself  by the pains and assistance of her friends
       she rises and adjusts her disordered dress
   Then loosening and combing her hair  she is bent on repairing to the
       field of battle
   First grasping her  petrem  189   wherewith to deprive herself of life
       when she reaches the place where the joy of her heart is lain
   She forthwith ascends her chariot  and sets out  favoured by a
       grateful breeze



   592  Sang siptan pawaranya tando a guruwing sanagara pada gurnita

   Dewi Satia Wati kitan wenanga sabda kumetere pangunchanging lara
   Leng leng tan anara teka ton tekapiran kapeting ane anekne kang ati
   Tan patma kalinger datanuru i pasambang ng ya saha pakraking sakit

   594  Antukning manulung nimitanera nang lilira mahayu lungsuring tapih
   Roma werata ninombara nera naminta tumotura mareng rana
   Patrem nitea minusti pangelanga jiwa na pupula mene lawan sineng
   Ngkan mangkat mahawan rata nela sama dresan kani sarantaning manah

565 602   Accompanied by  SagandÃ­ka   she wanders over the field of
battle by night in quest of his corpse  looking for it among the
number of prostrate slain  Appearance of the different dead bodies and
carcasses of horses  elephants   c  described  She often thinks that
she has found it  her repeated mistakes and disappointments

   603  Wearied with fruitless search  and despairing of finding him to
       whom she would make her obeisance  the princess
   Unsheathed her dagger  resolved to stab herself  her heart being
       wholly devoted to her husband
   But the Almighty  in pity  sent lightning to guide her to the spot
       where he whom she had long sought for lay
   And inspired her with strength and desire to renew the search

   604  All this while the chariot 190  lay buried among flowers which
       had been showered down upon it
   As if the growling thunder wept  tears fell in small rain  in grief
       for the death of the prince 191
   Such was the mark the princess followed till she came to and perceived
       the body of  SÃ¡lia
   Who seemed as if looking at her with a side glance as he lay with
       grinning teeth



   603  Meh tan diria mahas narendra ma isi ri taiyani sang enesti
       sambahan
   Paksa patrema sampunang lugasi kang ati sumaivaka nama sang pria
   Sih ningyang ukasan manambaya tuduh ri kaha nanera sang pinet nira
   Nahan etuniran panging kina ng ebang abanga maka sama ngosir kilat

   604  Oniang warsa sekar sumarsa akuwung kuwunga menoi ring ganing rata
   Genter lu era nangis malu a rarab ing rereba lara rilina sang prabu
   Na tang chihna tinut nareswara wadu teka lumi ati getra sang kakung
   Kadia nung sung a reh nikang mata atur lumiringa reja kesisan waja



   605  Then quickly seizing the feet of him  now lifeless  who stole
       from her bed
   Not knowing what she did  she patted  pressed  and kissed the body
   His lips she rubbed and stained red 192   supporting his head with her
       encircling arm  and wiping his face with the end of one of her
       garments  but long were his eyes without twinkling
   To cure his wounds she constantly applied her chewed  sÃ­ri

   606   Ah  ah  my princely lord  thou whom having sought I have at last
       found  why dost thou remain silent
    Wilt thou not speak to her who has thus sought thee out   Who else is
       there to be kind to me  unfortunate
    Tired and worn out am I with searching for thee  and now with averted
       glance thou refusest to look at me
    Shall I weep  or what is it thou wouldst have me do   Speak and tell
       me  instead of preserving this unmeaning smile

   607   Am I to understand that thou hast no regard for me  Come  quick
       speak comfort to me  and make my heart glad
   With words sweeter than honey  and nicely selected  did she thus hold
       converse with the dead  but it was all in vain
    Was it thus to meet death   said she   that thou didst steal from me
       when I was asleep
    And depart alone  without my knowledge  to the regions above  but I
       will follow thee



   605  Yekan pakrakir a mekul sukune sang peja aneliba ting galing tilam
   Tanwreng da tinepak tepak nera hanan kinisapu kinsuan sinukeman
   Lambe lot linuga tekeng magala ginusa pira ura lama tan kedap
   Lawan tang kanining kapwa warasa dening sepa ira lana jinam peaken

   606  Ah  ah  mah prabu sungsungen manemahta tuhana pani mita ning
       heneng
   Tan pangling ringana seraya siapa tika sia mowa gatingku kasian
   Ngel kwa met riwekas tiring paberatan katemo sahaja ewa tan wulat
   Wanten ta wekase tangis kwa mene kite suma ora ayo a ta minge

   607  Nanten weruh ngo angi tan sianti bapa meng gepa  ngamera raras
       priambada
   S ojar tan pÄsirat sirat madu tuhun ane saji saji tan tekeng ati
   Pangling gan rilalis ta  ngone nalis layata nilibi pamremeng ulun
   Nes tanyan lepasi sura laya yaya ku tumutura sadenya tan ling en



   608   It is my request that thou wilt meet and carry me across the
        ÃºgalÃ¡gil  stone 193
    Trembling and fearful should I be without thy support and assistance
    Although thou shouldst have many  WindadÃ¡ris  at thy command  yet
       still reserve a place for me before them all
    What must not be thy regard for her  who has thus wandered about
       after thee  and who is now going to die for thee

                      Measure  BasÃ¡nta tilÃ¡ka

   609  Tedious would be the relation of all that  SatÃ­a WÃ¡ti  said
   Oppressed with a load of grief  great as a mountain
   When she beheld her lord
   And determined to meet death



   608  Ngeng pintangakwa tuan papag nga ang ngirikang watu  gala gila
       namba eng gung an
   Tistisnya  ngoang ngikana tan wani lumampaha gigu ri tayenta raksaka
   Yadiastun jeneka  ngamer surawadu kita sumalanga ayo a nestura
   Pali tapwa welasat ring wang angomeng pati lumaku lana morang morang

                       Tembang Basanta tilaksa

   609  Tangi ujar satia watin pasambat
   Ikang lara marwata mangke nabuat
   Tuen katon tahananing iner er
   Matang nera dan pejahang kasang kas



   610  Seizing her dagger with firm grasp
   She drew it from its sheath  glancing as it came out
   Then boldly buried it in her breast
   Like shining gold was the blood that issued from the wound

   611  Not dying instantly  with expiring voice
    SugandÃ­ka  she called and thus addressed
    My old and faithful friend and attendant  return thou to  MandarÃ¡ka
    And tell the people there that I now send

   612   My last request to the good and worthy
    That they will commemorate the history of my sufferings
    In order that my story may be heard and known
    When the gentle heart will perhaps be moved with love and pity  and
       tears will flow at the sad tale

   614   Oh  my mistress  when was the time that I ever quitted thee
    Into whatever state of being thou may st pass  I will accompany thee
    Whom wilt thou have to send for water
    And who will wash my noble mistress  feet if I am not with her



   610  Minges marang kedga lana minusti
   Uwus kasaring sarungan pradipta
   Inan deman denira tan anangres
   Ila nikang rah kadi datu munchar

   611  Datan wawang mati magentak entak
   Sugandika lot tinawe sinabdan
   Kakangku mantuk ta ri mandraraka
   Wara tikang wang ri ukasku mangke

   612  Paminta kasi tari sang kawendra
   Larang ku dadiakena gita basa
   Rengine ngogang idepe gating ku
   Malar ngeresi twasnea mamang wa waspa

   614  Aduh Tuan ring kapana  saha ngoang
   Tumuta mon  jenma nejenma rakrian
   Siap eka konen ta mangengswa socha
   Ye tan ngwenga damo a rijeng ta masku



   617  Thus weeping  the female attendant  affected with grief
   The buried dagger drew  from the body of her mistress
   And stabbing herself  instantly expired
   At the feet of the princess  where her body lay

   618  Forthwith delighted their happy spirits together fled
   The astonished spirit of prince  SÃ¡lia  quickly said
    Uneasy and impatient have I waited for thee among the clouds
    With many  WidadÃ¡ris    PanditÃ¡s   and  DÃ©was

   619  Having taken the princess in his arms
   He returned with her by the road which leads to heaven
   There arrived  they find it extremely beautiful
   Of silk were the houses and brilliant were the precious stones

   620  Amusing herself  the princess
   Was delighted with the abundance of food which was there
   Great being the bounty of the Almighty to mankind
   And there was no difference susceptible in the ages of those that were
       there 194



   617  Nahan tangis ning pari charaka n gres
   Tanemne kang katga ye tenunusnea
   Inandeman ngeng eksans yan paratra
   Sawanya tan sa ridagan sudÃ©wi

621 624   The  PandÃ¡wa  hear that  SuyudÃ¡na  is in the middle of
the river  delighted  they repair to the spot   BÃ­ma  calls him a
dastardly coward afraid to die  and assures him that his arm will reach
him  whithersoever he may betake himself  to the lowest depth of the
earth or the highest region of heaven

625 628    SuyudÃ¡na  comes out of the water and assures BÃ­ma that he
betook himself to the river  not out of fear  but for the purpose of
making adoration to the gods  challenging  BÃ­ma   or any other of the
PandÃ¡wa   to combat   KrÃ©sna  represents that  DÃ©rma WÃ¡ngsna  is too
peaceable and benevolent to fight against  SuyudÃ¡na   that  ArjÃºna s
forte consists in using the bow mounted in a chariot  that  NakÃºla  and
SedÃ©wa  are too young and inexperienced  and that  BÃ­ma  is therefore
the fittest of all the  PandÃ¡wa  to oppose  SuyudÃ¡na

629 631    KakrasÃ¡na  is informed by  NarÃ¡da  of the  PandÃ¡wa  and
KurÃ¡wa  forces being engaged  and withdraws to see the issue of the
contest   BÃ­ma  and  SuyudÃ¡na  go and make their respects to him  and
each receives from him a charm

632 639    BÃ­ma  and  SuyudÃ¡na  fight  Missing each other  they strike
and cut the earth  trees  and every thing about them  without being
able to hurt each other  They then throw away their weapons  and
closing  wrestle  So closely are they united  that they seem to be one
person and to have one voice

640 656    ArjÃºna  repeatedly striking his hand on his left thigh
reminds  BÃ­ma  of  SuyudÃ¡na s  being vulnerable in that particular
place only   BÃ­ma  recollecting the circumstance  seizes his club and
strikes  SuyudÃ¡na  with it in his vulnerable part   SuyudÃ¡na  falls
and expiring under the blow is trampled upon by  BÃ­ma   who continues
to insult and triumph over him  till out of all patience with his
relentless and ungenerous conduct   KakrasÃ¡na  seizes his spear and is
going to slay  BÃ­ma   but is withheld by  KrÃ©sna   who says that  BÃ­ma
is not to be blamed for such just retaliation



Here end the Javan copies of this work  the following abstract is from
a copy of the  BrÃ¡ta YÃºdha KÃ¡wi  presented to me by the  RÃ¡ja  of  BÃ¡li
BalÃ­lÃ­ng  in  BÃ¡li

657 667    SuyudÃ¡na  dead  and night coming on  the  PandÃ¡wa  retire
from the scene of battle to the city of  AstÃ­na   and there feast and
rejoice  on account of their victory  Satiated and fatigued with their
revelling  all except  KrÃ©sna  go to sleep  He alone remains awake
pitying in his own mind the fate of  SuyudÃ¡na   and recollecting with
feelings of regret the indignant and unkind manner in which he was
treated by  BÃ­ma   Withdrawing by stealth  he goes to the mountains
and wanders about oppressed with grief and much agitated

668   Next morning the  PandÃ¡wa  missing  KrÃ©sna   go in search of
him  and find him among the images on the hills  Portentous signs take
place  A raven croaks till blood issues from its beak  it rains blood
and all the wild animals fight with each other

669   Next morning all these omens are gone

670 693   News arrives from  AstÃ­na  of  AswatÃ¡ma s  having entered
the city by night  and assassinated  DrÃ©sta drÃ­umna    SÃ©rikÃ¡ndi   and
PÃ¡nchakumÃ¡ra   and of all the  mÃ¡ntris  having fled for fear  Half
are inclined to give credit to the report  and half believe that it
must have been the spirit of  SÃ¡lia   The  PandÃ¡wa  return to  AstÃ­na
and find the women there all in tears  and bewailing the loss of those
who had been murdered during the night   KrÃ©sna  consoles them  and
reconciles them to what has happened

694 696    KrÃ©sna  makes the  PandÃ¡wa  accompany him in search of
AswatÃ¡ma   whom they find among the hills

697 699    BÃ­ma  is going to strike  AswatÃ¡ma   when the latter
discharges an arrow at  BÃ­ma   and at the same time tells him he is not
a fit opponent  inviting  ArjÃºna  to contend with him   ArjÃºna  and
AswatÃ¡ma  fight  causing the earth and mountains to shake   c

700 705    SÃ¡ng yÃ¡ng NarÃ¡da  descends from above  and tells  ArjÃºna
that they will cause the destruction of the world if they continue
the dreadful conflict   SÃ¡ng yÃ¡ng NarÃ¡da  at the same time goes up to
AswatÃ¡ma   and advises him to desist from opposing the  PandÃ¡wa
as he will certainly be beaten  and recommends his surrender and
resignation to the  PandÃ¡wa  of his  pusÃ¡ka  of  ChÃºda manik   also
called  ChÃºpu mÃ¡nik EstÃ­gÃ©na   a charm which gives its possessor the
power of getting eight different things

706 707    AswatÃ¡ma  refuses to give it to the  PandÃ¡wa   but is
willing to part with it to the unborn grandson of  ArjÃºna   of whom
UtÃ¡ri  was then pregnant  and whom he directed should be called
ParikÃ­sit

708 709    KrÃ©sna  offers to bear witness to the promise  after which
AswatÃ¡ma  gives the  pusÃ¡ka  to  BÃ­ma   to deliver to the grandson of
ArjÃºna

710 714    KrÃ©sna  and the  PandÃ¡wa  again return to  AstÃ­na   and
inform  ArjÃºna s  wife of what has happened   AswatÃ¡ma  remains
aloof from the  PandÃ¡wa   wandering about in the woods and among the
mountains   YuyÃºtsuh   the only surviving  KurÃ¡wa  chief  joins and
lives with the  PandÃ¡wa   All the sons of the  PandÃ¡wa  having been
killed in the battle  without a single descendant being left to be
made a king of  AstÃ­na   excepting the yet unborn son of  AbimÃ¡nyu
whom  UtÃ¡ri  was about to bring forth   DÃ©rma Wangsa   the eldest of
the  PandÃ¡wa   although all of them had arrived at an age when they
should withdraw from the world  is appointed sovereign  until such time
as he can be relieved and succeeded by the yet unborn  ParikÃ­sit
Description of  DÃ©rma WÃ¡ngsa   the beauty of his person  his many
good qualities and accomplishments  for which and for his character
for justice  wisdom  prudence   c  he is universally beloved  and his
praises celebrated in song

715 719    DÃ©rma WÃ¡ngsa  receives the name and title of  BatÃ¡ra JÃ¡ya
BÃ¡ya   Under his wise and excellent administration the kingdom of
AstÃ­na  flourishes  crimes are unknown  and the inhabitants are
happy  The neighbouring princes of Java  who had survived the war  all
acknowledge the authority of the king of  AstÃ­na   and pay homage to
him



The musical instruments of the Javans are peculiar  Several of them
are necessary to compose a  gÃ¡melan   set  or band  of these there are
several varieties  The  gÃ¡melan salÃ­ndro   which is the most perfect
consists of the several instruments represented in the plate  In the
gÃ¡melan pÃ©log   the instruments are much larger and louder  the
bÃ³nang  or  krÃ³mo   has sometimes only ten  and sometimes as many as
fourteen notes  Both of these  gÃ¡melans  are employed as accompaniments
to the  wÃ¡yangs   The  gÃ¡melan mÃ­ring  partakes of the two former
and is employed to accompany the  wÃ¡yang klÃ­tik   In the  gÃ¡melan
mÃºng gang   called also  kÃ³dok ng Ã³rek   from its resembling the
croaking of frogs  the  bÃ³nang  has fifteen notes  and the  kÃ©cher
resembles the triangle  neither the  gÃ©nder    salentam    sarÃ³n   nor
chalÃ©mpung  are included in this set  this  gÃ¡melan  is considered the
most ancient  and is played at tournaments  in processions   c  In the
chÃ¡ra bÃ¡li   or  chÃ¡ra wÃ¡ngsul   the  rebÃ¡b   or viol  is not used
in other respects the instruments are the same as in the  salÃ­ndro
except that they are as large as in the  pÃ©log   The  gÃ¡melan sekÃ¡ten
which resembles the  pÃ©log   except that the instruments are still
larger and louder  is restricted to the use of the sovereign  and
seldom played  except on great occasions  as during eight days of
the festival of  MÃºlut   The  gÃ¡melan srÃºnen  is used in processions
of state and in war  being properly the martial music of the country
in which  besides the ordinary instruments  a particular  gong  and
trumpets are introduced

The plate will afford a better idea of the form of these instruments
than any verbal description  Most of them resemble the  staccÃ¡to  or
harmonica  and the sound is produced by the stroke of a hammer  The
gÃ¡mbang kÃ¡yu  has wooden plates  sixteen or seventeen in number  the
gÃ¡mbang gÃ¡ngsa   of which there are several in each band  has metal
plates

In the  gÃ©nder  the metal plates are thin  of a different form  and
suspended by strings  The  gong   represented  No  9  in the plate  is
usually three feet in diameter  The  bÃ³nang    kÃ©nong   and  ketÃ³k
are of metal  and are suspended by tightened cords to favour the
vibration  The  kÃ©cher   shewn in the plate  corresponds with the
cymbal  The hammers with which the larger instruments are struck are
either wound round at the end with cloth  or the elastic gum  in order
to soften the sound  The drum is struck with the open hand and fingers
only  The  chalÃ©mpung  is a stringed instrument  with from ten to
fifteen wires  which are sounded with the finger  after the manner of
the harp

The person who leads the band performs upon the  rebÃ¡b   No  17   an
instrument which  having a neck  and two strings pitched by pegs  is
capable of producing perfect intonation and a variety of sounds  by
shortening the strings with the pressure of the finger

The  gÃ¡mbang kÃ¡yu   No  2  is a kind of  staccÃ¡to   consisting of
wooden bars of graduated lengths  placed across a kind of boat
which  when skilfully struck with a sort of mallet  produce pleasing
tones  either grave or acute  The lowest and highest sounds of the
instrument differ from each other by the interval of three octaves
and a major third  the intermediate sounds of each octave from the
lowest note are a second  third  fifth  and sixth  This instrument is
general throughout the Archipelago  and is frequently played alone  or
accompanied only by the drum and a small  gong    RÃ¡den RÃ¡na DipÃºra
a native of Java  who accompanied me to England  played on this
instrument several of his national melodies before an eminent composer
all of which were found to bear a strong resemblance to the oldest
music of Scotland  the distinctive character of both  as well as of
Indian music in general  being determined by the want of the fourth
and seventh of the key  and of all the semitones 195   By reiteration
several of the sounds are artfully prolonged much beyond their noted
length  which produces an irregularity of measure that might both
perplex and offend the educated ear of an accompanying timeist  The
rhythm of the sections  from extention and contraction  appears very
imperfect

The  bÃ³nang  or  krÃ³mo   No  3  the  sÃ¡ron   No  5  the  dÃ©mong    No
6  and  selÃ¡ntam   No  7  are  staccÃ¡tos  of metallic bars  and a sort
of bells placed on a frame  They contain a regular dianotic scale
and nearly two octaves  These  however  are never played singly  but
harmonize with the instrument on which the air is played

The  gongs   No  9  are perhaps the noblest instruments of the kind
that have been brought to Europe  I am assured that they are very
superior to that which was admitted in the terrific scenes of the
serious ballet representing the death of Captain Cooke  Suspended in
frames  and struck by a mallet covered with cloth or elastic gum  they
sustain the harmonious triad in a very perfect manner  and are probably
the most powerful and musical of all monotonous instruments  They might
be introduced with advantage in lieu of large drums  They have the
advantage of being mellifluous  and capable of accompanying pathetic
strains  The two  gongs  differ from each other by one note

The above observations apply particularly to the  gÃ¡melan pÃ©log   which
usually accompanies the recitation of the popular poems of the country
The  gÃ¡mbang kÃ¡yu  of the  salÃ­ndru  appears only to differ in being
in another key  which is considered better suited to the occasions in
which that kind of  gÃ¡melan  is used

The airs which are exhibited in the plate are selected from several
written down by a gentleman at  SemÃ¡rang   as they were played on the
rebÃ¡b  of the  gÃ¡melan pÃ©log   and may afford a further illustration
of the nature of their music

But it is the harmony and pleasing sound of all the instruments united
which gives the music of Java its peculiar character among Asiatics
The sounds produced on several of the instruments are peculiarly
rich  and when heard at a distance have been frequently compared to
those produced on the harmonic glasses  The airs  however simple and
monotonous they may appear of themselves  when played on the  gÃ¡mbang
kÃ¡yu   or accompanied by the other instruments  never tire on the ear
and it is not unusual for the  gÃ¡melan  to play for many days and
nights in succession

The Javans do not note down or commit their music to writing  the
national airs  of which I have myself counted above a hundred  are
preserved by the ear alone  Those which are exhibited in the plate
are among the most popular  but there are a variety which are played
on occasions of rejoicing and festivity  which it would be difficult
to note down  if  indeed  they can be called airs at all  the sounds
produced rather resembling the chiming of bells than a melody  Thus
when a great man arrives at the native seat of government  the tune of
kÃ©bu gÃ­ru    buffaloes frisking   is played  and a variety of others
of the same nature  which diffuse the same kind of joy and gaiety among
all assembled  as the quick ringing of bells in the churches of England

A complete set of the  gÃ¡melan pÃ©log  costs from a thousand to six
hundred dollars   250 to  400   but second hand sets are frequently
disposed of  The principal manufacture is at  GrÃ©sik   and the  gongs
in particular furnish a valuable article of export  Every native chief
in authority has one or more  gÃ¡melans   and there are more or less
perfect sets in all the populous towns of the eastern provinces

In some of the interior  and in particular in the  SÃºnda  districts
the inhabitants still perform on a rude instrument of  bÃ¡mbu   called
the  Ã¡ngklung   of which a representation is given in one of the
plates  This instrument is formed of five or more tubes of  bÃ¡mbu
cut at the end after the manner of the barrels of an organ  These
which are of graduated lengths  from about twenty to eight inches  are
placed in a frame  in such a manner as to move to a certain extent
from their position  and to vibrate on the frame being shaken  A
troop of from ten to fifty mountaineers  each with an  Ã¡ngklung   and
accompanied by one or two others with a small drum played with the open
hand  always perform upon this instrument on occasions of festivity
in the  SÃºnda  districts  The upper part of the instrument  and the
parties themselves  are generally decorated with common feathers  and
the performers  in their appearance and action  are frequently as
grotesque and wild as can be imagined  There is something  however
so extremely simple  and at the same time gay  in the sound produced
by the rattling of these  bÃ¡mbu  tubes  that I confess I have never
heard the  Ã¡ngklung  without pleasure  The Javans say the first music
of which they have an idea was produced by the accidental admission of
the air into a  bÃ¡mbu  tube  which was left hanging on a tree  and that
the  Ã¡ngklung  was the first improvement upon this Ã†olian music  With
regard to the music of the  gÃ¡melan    that   they say   was procured
from heaven  and we have a long story about it

A wind instrument  of the nature of a flute  but in length some
feet  with a proportionate diameter  is sometimes introduced in the
gÃ¡melans   but this is not usual in Java  though  in  BÃ¡li  it is
general

The  trawÃ¡ngsa  is a stringed instrument  not very unlike a
guitar 196   which is occasionally found in the  SÃºnda  districts  it
is by no means general  I recollect to have once heard an old blind
bard at  ChiÃ¡njur  play upon this instrument  reciting at the same
time traditions respecting  PajajÃ¡ran   and the ancient history of the
country  which had probably never been committed to writing

The Javans have made no progress in drawing or painting  nor are there
any traces to be found of their having  at any former period of their
history  attained any proficiency in this art  They are not  however
ignorant of proportions or perspective  nor are they insensible to
the beauty and effect of the productions of other nations 197   Their
eye is correct and their hand steady  and if required to sketch
any particular object  they produce a very fair resemblance of the
original  They are imitative  and though genius in this art may not
have yet appeared among them  there is reason to believe that  with
due encouragement  they would not be found less ingenious than other
nations in a similar stage of civilization  They have a tradition  that
the art of painting was once successfully cultivated among them  and a
period is even assigned to the loss of it  but the tradition does not
seem entitled to much credit

The Javans do not appear to possess any peculiar method or system
in their arithmetical calculations  They generally compute without
putting down the figures in writing  In this process they are slow
but generally correct  The common people  from an entire ignorance of
arithmetic  or to assist their memory  sometimes use grains of  pÃ¡ri
or small stones on these occasions

The many vast and magnificent remains of edifices found at this day in
different parts of Java  bear witness to the high degree of perfection
in which architecture and sculpture were at one period practised in
that island  But whether the natives themselves designed these edifices
and their ornaments  or only worked under the direction of ingenious
artists from other countries  is a question connected with their
history  which we shall at present forbear to inquire into

The art of sculpture is entirely lost to the natives  The only modern
buildings they possess  of any architectural importance  are the
krÃ¡tons   or palaces of the chiefs  which have already been described

The Javans of the present day have no pretensions to astronomy as a
science  The seasons are determined by reference to a system no longer
perfectly understood  either in its principle or application  but from
the Hindu terms still in use for the days of the week   c  and from
the similarity of many of their superstitions to those of continental
India  it seems probable that if they ever possessed an astronomical
system  it was derived from that quarter  Thus when an eclipse takes
place  the people shout and make all the noise they can  to prevent
the sun or moon from being devoured by the great  nÃ¡ga   or dragon
which they suppose to be invading it  Some of the better informed have
derived a few notions of astronomy from the Arabs  but their knowledge
in this respect  is at best extremely imperfect  and it is rather to
the traces which are to be found in the ancient manuscripts  and to the
remains of what they knew in former days  that it is interesting to
refer

The Javans  in common with other Mahomedans  have  for upwards of two
centuries  if not for a longer period  adopted the lunar year of the
Arabs  but they still retain their own era  and seldom adopt that
of the Hejira  The Javan era is called that of  Aji SÃ¡ka   on whose
arrival in Java it is supposed to have commenced  but as  sÃ¡ka  is a
Sanscrit term  variously applied  as connected with the establishment
of an era  it was probably adopted by the Javans at the period of the
introduction of the era itself 198   which corresponds almost exactly
with the Hindu era of  Salavaharna   being seventy four years short
of the Christian era  The present is accordingly the year 1744 of
the Javan era  or era of  Aji SÃ¡ka   On  BÃ¡li   where the same era
is likewise adopted  there is a difference of about seven years  the
BÃ¡li  year being 1737  This difference is supposed to have arisen from
the people of  BÃ¡li   who are still unconverted to the Mahomedan faith
continuing to use the solar year

The Javans usually divide the day and night each into five portions  as
follows

                          Division of the Day

 The period from six o clock in the morning
   till eight is called                         Ã©suk

 That from eight to noon                        teng angi

 That from noon till one o clock                bedÃºg

 That from one till three                       lingsir kÃºlon

 That from three till six                       Ã¡sar

                       Division of the Night

 The period from six o clock in the evening
   till eight is called                         sÃ³rÃ©

 That from eight till eleven o clock            sirapwÃ³ng

 That from midnight till one o clock            teng awÃ©ng i

 That from one o clock till three               lÃ­ngsir wÃ©ng i

 That from three o clock till daylight         bÃ¡ng un

The twenty four hours of the day and night are also occasionally
divided into what is called the  lÃ­ma wÃ¡ktu   or five periods of time
namely  from sunset until eight o clock in the morning  from that hour
till twelve  from twelve till three  from three till four  from four
till sunset

Each of these divisions is considered sacred to one of the five
deities   Sri    KÃ¡la    WÃ­snu    MaheswÃ¡ra   and  BrÃ¡ma   supposed
to preside over these divisions of the day and night in rotation  the
order being changed every day  until at the commencement of every
fifth day and night it returns to the same again  The division which
thus becomes sacred to  Sri  is considered fortunate  that to  KÃ¡la
unfortunate  that to  WÃ­snu  neither good nor bad  that to  MaheswÃ¡ra
as still more fortunate than that to  Sri   that to  BrÃ¡ma  as
peculiarly unfortunate

The terms  pÃ¡hing    pon    wÃ¡gi    kalÃ­won   and  mÃ¡nis  or  lÃ©gi
are applied to the days of the  panchawÃ¡ra   or week of five days
which is common throughout the country  and by which the markets are
universally regulated 199

Besides this week of five days  which seems to be by far the most
ancient as well as the most generally adopted among them  the Javans
have a week of seven days as follows

  DÃ­ti   Sunday   which corresponds with the Hindu   Rowi
  SÃ³ma   Monday                                      Soma
  Ang gÃ¡ra   Tuesday                                 Mangala
  BÃºdha   Wednesday                                  Budha
  RaspÃ¡ti   Thursday                                 Vrihaspati
  SÃºkra   Friday                                     Sukra
  SanischÃ¡ra  or  TÃºmpah   Saturday                  Sani

The Arabic terms are usually employed to express the months

The weeks of seven days  considered with reference to the seasons
are termed  wÃºku   Thirty of these are said to have been established
in commemoration of the victory obtained over  WÃ¡tu GÃºnung  200
These thirty have again six principal divisions  each consisting of
thirty five days  and commencing on the day when  dÃ­ti  and  pÃ¡hing
fall together

Each  wÃºku   is dedicated to its particular deity  and has its
appropriate emblems in the Javan system of judicial astrology  The
names of the  wÃºku  and of the deities to which each is considered
sacred are as follow

      WÃšKU                  DÃ‰WA OR DEITY

 29    DukÃºd            KanÃ©ka
 30    WÃ¡tu gÃºnung      GÃºru

The twelve seasons   MÃ¡ngsa   of which an account has been given  when
treating of the agriculture of the Javans  are said to be determined
by reference to the sun s course at the commencement of each of these
divisions

When a want of rain is experienced  it is a custom for the people of
the village or town to assemble  and for a  wÃ¡yang  to be performed
upon the story of  WÃ¡tu GÃºnung  and  DÃ©wi SÃ­nta   On these occasions
two sticks of the dark coloured sugar cane  two young and two old
cocoa nuts  two bundles of different coloured  pÃ¡ri   two bundles of
the flowers of the  areca  nut  a piece of white cloth  sweet scented
oils  two fowls and two ducks  are placed by the side of the  dÃ¡lang
during the performance  and are afterwards considered his property

The term  wÃ­ndu  is used to express a revolution or cycle of years  The
Javans refer to  wÃ­ndu  of eight years  a  wÃ­ndu  of twelve years  a
wÃ­ndu  of twenty years  and a  wÃ­ndu  of thirty two years  The  wÃ­ndu
of eight years  now in use  seems to have been borrowed from the Arabs
but this is more frequently considered of seven years  each year taking
its name from one of the following animals  according to the day of the
week on which it begins

  MangkÃ¡ra    Prawn               if on a  Friday
  MÃ©nda       Goat                         Saturday
  KlÃ¡bong     Centiped                     Sunday
  WichÃ­tra    Worm                         Monday
  MintÃºna     A species of fish            Tuesday
  Was         Scorpion                     Wednesday
  MaisÃ¡ba     Buffalo                      Thursday

The names given to the year comprised in the  wÃ­ndu  of twelve years
appear to be the same with the signs of the zodiac  which  according to
the manuscript discovered at ChÃ©ribon  are as follow

  1   MÃ©sa  or  MesÃ¡ris            the Ram  corresponding with the Hindu
                                                   Mesha
  2   M rÃ­sa  or  M resÃ¡ba         the Bull        Vrisha
  3   M ritÃºna  or  M rikaga       the Butterfly   Mithuna   the pair
  4   KalakÃ¡ta  or  Kkala kadi     the Crab        Karkata
  5   Sing ha  or  GrigrÃ©son       the Lion        Sinha
  6   Kanya  or  KangerÃ¡sa         the Virgin      Kunya
  7   Tula  or  TularÃ¡si           the Balance     Tula
  8   Mri Chika  or  PriwitarÃ¡si   the Scorpion    Vrishchica
  9   DÃ¡nu  or  WÃ¡nok              the Bow         Danus
 10   MakÃ¡ra                       the Crawfish    Makara   sea monster
 11   KÃºba                         the Water jug   Kumbha
 12   MÃ©na                         the Fish        Mina  201

The Javans  though they occasionally apply the signs of the zodiac to
the twelve years of the cycle  have at present no knowledge of these
signs as connected with the sun s course  In the ChÃ©ribon manuscript
which contains an explanation of each sign  they seem to have been
considered only as giving names to particular years  Thus in the
explanations of the first sign it is stated

This year  the year of  Mesa arsi   there is a mark in the horn of the
ram  the deity who presides is  BatÃ¡ra Wisnu   the rain is for five
months  it is profitable to plant  gÃ¡gas   but birds destroy great
quantities  this may be prevented by administering  obat   medicine
composed of the oil of the  kÃ¡wang   with the flowers of the cotton
plant and those of the  kasÃºmba   rats also do great mischief in the
sÃ¡wahs   which may be prevented by administering the  bud  of  sÃ­ri
on a lucky day  named  ang gara   and  diti  on the  panchawÃ¡ra MÃ¡nis
when administering it the following words should be repeated    Hong
KÃ­ro WÃ­snu SÃ³wa  tung gal sih ning BuÃ¡na     Hail Wisnu  who art beheld
clearly to be the only one in the world

In the same manuscript  which appears to be entirely of an astronomical
or astrological nature  the year appears to be divided into four
portions  each distinguished by the peculiar position of a  nÃ¡ga   or
serpent

The first of the three divisions includes  Jista    SÃ¡da    KÃ¡sar   the
form and shape of the great  nÃ¡ga  in these seasons is first stated
and represented by a drawing  the head being during these months
towards the east and tail to the west   In these months  if any one
wishes to plant rice  it must be white and yellow  pÃ¡ri   and at this
time alms must be given  consisting of white rice ornamented with the
flowers called  wÃ¡ri   and in the name of or in honour of  DÃ©wa YÃ¡ma
and on the seventh day  It will not be profitable to go to war in these
months

If a child is born in these months he will be liable to seven
sicknesses through life  Great care and caution must be taken in these
months against sickness

The second is as follows

In the seasons of  KÃ¡ru    KatÃ­ga   and  Kaphat   the head of the
nÃ¡ga  is to the north and tail to the west  These times are neither
good nor bad  it is proper to plant yellow  pÃ¡ri   alms should be given
of  bÃºbur Ã¡bang   red rice and water   c  in honour or in the name of
DÃ©wa SarasÃ¡ti   Success will attend wars undertaken in these months

If a child is born in the month it will be unfortunate  and great care
and caution must be taken regarding it  and if the child attains an
advanced age  unhappiness will befal the parent

In the third  nÃ¡ga   which includes the fifth  sixth  and seventh
seasons  the head of the  nÃ¡ga   it says   is to the west  his tail
to the east  his belly to the north  The offering then to be made is
yellow rice  and a small ivory handled knife ornamented with gold  The
deity of these months is  BatÃ¡ra Sarastati   In going to war in these
seasons  be careful not to face the head of the  nÃ¡ga  202

194  Having since my return to England put these illustrations of the
Brata Yudha  in the hands of a relative  the Rev  Thomas Raffles  of
Liverpool   he has been kind enough to give the translation a poetical
dress  and I regret that the limits of the present volume do not admit
of their insertion in this form  in justice to the poetry of Java and
the talent which he has displayed  The following example of the last
stanzas may serve as a specimen of the style and spirit in which the
task has been executed

   603  Wearied with fruitless search  and in despair
   To find the object of her pious care
   Her murder d lord  who on the battle plain
   Lay all neglected mid the thousands slain
   She drew the dagger from its sheath of rest
   Intent to plunge it in her heaving breast
   Just then  as if in pity to her grief
   Flash d the red light ning to the maid s relief
   And shew d with horrid glare the bloody way
   To where her husband s mangled body lay

   604  Another flash  indulgent from the skies
   Points to the spot where  SÃ¡lia s  carriage lies
   And  SÃ¡lia s  self  whom living she adored
   The bleeding body of her murder d lord
   The richest flowers by heavenly influence shed
   Their sweetest odours o er his honoured head
   The muttering thunder mourned his early tomb
   And heaven in showers bewailed the hero s doom

   605  With eager grasp the livid corpse she press d
   In frantic wildness to her throbbing breast
   Tried every art of love that might beguile
   Its sullen features to one cheerful smile
   Kiss d those dear lips so late of coral red
   As if unconscious that the soul had fled
   Then in her folded arms his head she rais d
   And long on those beloved features gazed
   With  sÃ­ri  juice his pallid lips she died
   And to his wounds its healing balm applied
   While with the skirt of her embroidered vest
   She wip d the blood drops from his mangled breast

   606   Ah  then  my princely lord  whom I have found
    Bleeding and mangled on this cursed ground
    Why are thy lips in sullen silence sealed
    To her who sought thee on this battle field
    Wilt thou not speak  my love  my lord  my all
    Or still in vain must  SÃ¡tia WÃ¡ti  call
    Say  shall my copious tears in torrents flow
    And thus express my agony and woe
    How shall I move thee  by what art beguile
    The ghastly air of that unmeaning smile

   607  Thus soft and tender were the words she poured
   To move the pity of her murder d lord
   But ah  no sound the unconscious dead return d
   No fire of love within his bosom burn d
   While at each pause a death like stillness stole
   O er the deep anguish of the mourner s soul
    And was it thus to bow thy honour d head
    Amid the thousands of the mingled dead
    That on that fatal morning thou didst glide
    With gentle footsteps from thy consort s side
    And thus to reach the glorious realms above
    Without the faithful partner of thy love
    But earth has lost its fleeting charms for me
    And  happy spirit  I will follow thee

   608   Oh  meet and bear me o er that fatal stone
    Nor let me pass it  trembling and alone
    Though  WidadÃ¡ris  shall obey thy call
    Yet keep for me a place above them all
    To whom but me does that first place belong
    Who sought and found thee mid this ghastly throng
    And who  unable to survive thy doom
    Thus sheds her blood and shares thy honour d tomb

   610  Then with a steady hand the noble maid
   Drew from its peaceful sheath the gleaming blade
   From her fair bosom tore th  embroidered vest
   And plunged it deep within her heaving breast
   Rich was the blood that issued from the wound
   And streamed like liquid gold upon the ground

   611  And while the ebbing tide of life remained
   And thought and reason were a while sustained
   She called her maiden with her feeble breath
   And thus address d her from the arms of death

   612   Oh  when my spirit soars to realms above
    Take this my last request to those I love
    Tell them to think of  SÃ¡tia Wati s  fate
    And oft the story of her love relate
    Then o er her woes the tender heart shall sigh
    And the big tear drop roll from pity s eye

   614   Ah my lov d mistress   cried the faithful maid
    In every scene by thee I gladly staid
    Whate er the state of being thou must know
    Thy faithful maiden will partake it too
    What hand but mine the cooling stream shall pour
    Or bathe the feet of her whom I adore

   617  Strong in despair  and starting from the ground
   She drew the dagger from her mistress  wound
   With deadly aim she plunged it in her breast
   And with her mistress sunk to endless rest

   618  Then did their happy spirits wing their way
   To the fair regions of eternal day
   The astonish d shade of  SÃ¡lia  linger d there
   Borne on the pinions of the ambient air
   To bid the object of his earthly love
   An eager welcome to the realms above

   619  Then in his arms his lovely bride he bore
   Up that resplendent path he trod before
   Till earth and time had vanished all away
   Amid the splendours of eternal day
   Where fields of light and silken mansions stand
   The glorious work of a celestial hand

   620  Th  enraptured princess  dazzled with the sight
   Gazed o er the boundless realms of living light
   With heavenly fruit the eternal groves were crowned
   And joy and rich profusion smiled around
   All bore the bloom of an immortal youth
   All breathed alike the air of love and truth
   And all adoring one eternal mind
   The Almighty  rich in bounty to mankind

of the Grecian music

197  We can hardly suppose them to have been as ignorant of the
art of design as their neighbours on Borneo  at the period of their
being first visited by Europeans  The following story is translated
from a note in Joao de Barros  4 Decade  Book I  Chap  17   Vasco
Lorenco Drejo Cam and Gonzala Veltoza  were sent to the King of Borneo
on a treaty of commerce  Among their presents was a piece of tapestry
representing the marriage of Henry VIII  of England and Catherine
Princess of Arragon  The king received them well  but on delivering
the presents  the piece of tapestry was displayed  with the figures as
large as life  This to the king was matter of alarm and suspicion  for
he imagined that the figures must be enchanted  and that the Portuguese
wished to introduce them under his roof to deprive him of his kingdom
and his life  He ordered the tapestry to be immediately removed  and
that the Portuguese should immediately depart  as he did not chuse to
have any more kings beside himself in the country  and all attempts to
pacify him were fruitless    Vol  IV  Part I  p  107

It has already been stated  that the established religion of the
country is that of Mahomed  The earliest allusion to this faith made
in the Javan annals is in the twelfth century of the Javan era  A D
1250   when an unsuccessful attempt appears to have been made to
convert some of the  SÃºnda  princes 203   Towards the close of the
fourteenth century  several missionaries established themselves in
the eastern provinces  and according to the Javan annals  and the
universal tradition of the country  it was in the first year of the
fifteenth century of the Javan era  or about the year of our Lord 1475
that the Hindu empire of  MajapÃ¡hit   then supreme on the island  was
overthrown  and the Mahomedan religion became the established faith
of the country  When the Portuguese first visited Java in 1511  they
found a Hindu king in Bantam  and subsequently  they are said to have
lost their footing in that province  in consequence of the arrival and
establishment of a Mahomedan prince there  but with the exception of an
inconsiderable number in some of the interior and mountainous tracts
the whole island appears to have been converted to Mahomedanism in
the course of the sixteenth century  or at least at the period of the
establishment of the Dutch at Batavia in 1620

The natives are still devotedly attached to their ancient institutions
and though they have long ceased to respect the temples and idols of a
former worship  they still retain a high respect for the laws  usages
and national observances which prevailed before the introduction of
Mahomedanism  And although some few individuals among them may aspire
to a higher sanctity and closer conformity to Mahomedanism than
others  it may be fairly stated  that the Javans in general  while
they believe in one supreme God  and that Mahomed was his Prophet
and observe some of the outward forms of the worship and observances
are little acquainted with the doctrines of that religion  and are
the least bigoted of its followers  Few of the chiefs decline the use
of wine  and if the common people abstain from inebriating liquors
it is not from any religious motive  Mahomedan institutions  however
are still gaining ground  and with a free trade a great accession of
Arab teachers might be expected to arrive  Property usually descends
according to the Mahomedan law  but in other cases  the Mahomedan code
as adopted by the Javans  is strangely blended with the more ancient
institutions of the country 204

Pilgrimages to Mecca are common  When the Dutch first established
themselves on Java  it was not unusual for the chiefs of the highest
rank to undertake the voyage  as will be seen in the course of the
native history  As soon  however  as the Dutch obtained a supremacy
they did all they could to check this practice  as well as the
admission of Arab missionaries  and by the operation of the system of
commercial monopoly which they adopted  succeeded pretty effectually
It does not  however  appear that this arose from any desire to check
the progress of Mahomedanism on Java  or that it was with any view to
introduce the doctrines of Christianity  that they wished to cut off
the communication with Mecca  their sole objects appear to have been
the safety of their own power and the tranquillity of the country
Every Arab from Mecca  as well as every Javan who had returned from
a pilgrimage thither  assumed on Java the character of a saint  and
the credulity of the common people was such  that they too often
attributed to such persons supernatural powers  Thus respected  it
was not difficult for them to rouse the country to rebellion  and
they became the most dangerous instruments in the hands of the native
authorities opposed to the Dutch interests  The Mahomedan priests have
almost invariably been found most active in every case of insurrection
Numbers of them  generally a mixed breed between the Arabs and the
islanders  go about from state to state in the Eastern Islands  and it
is generally by their intrigues and exhortations that the native chiefs
are stirred up to attack or massacre the Europeans  as infidels and
intruders

The commercial monopoly of the Dutch  however injurious to the country
in other respects  was in this highly advantageous to the character of
the Javans  as it preserved them from the reception of many of the more
intolerable and deteriorating tenets of the  KÃ³ran

I have already mentioned  that every village has its priest  and that
in every village of importance there is a mosque or building set apart
adapted to religious worship  The usual Mahomedan service is performed
and the  PanghÃºlu   or priest  consulted  and decides in all cases of
marriage  divorce  and inheritance  He is bound also to remind the
villagers of the proper season for the cultivation of the lands  He
is remunerated by a tithe of the produce of the land  certain fees
which are paid on circumcisions  marriages  divorces  and funerals
and presents which are usual at particular seasons and on particular
occasions

In every chief town there is a high priest  who with the assistance
of several inferior priests  holds an ecclesiastical court  and
superintends the priests who are appointed in the subordinate districts
and villages  His emoluments consist of a share  which varies in
different districts  of the  zakÃ¡t  levied by the village priests  of
fees of court  presents   c  These chief priests are usually either
Arabs  or descendants of Arabs  by women of the islands  Their number
in some of the large towns is considerable  at  PakalÃ³ngan  and
GrÃ©sik  they have amounted to some hundreds  The village priests are
mostly Javans  On entering the profession  they adopt a dress different
from that of the Javans in general  wearing a turban and long gown
after the manner of the Arabs  and encouraging  as much as possible
the growth of a few hairs on the chin  as a beard  It is probable  that
the total number of priests is not less than fifty thousand  which
forms a ninetieth part of the whole population of the island

In common with other Mahomedans  the Javans observe the ceremony of
circumcision   sÃ³nat    which is performed at about eight years of age
and in a manner somewhat differing from that usual in other countries
The ceremony is usually attended with a feast and rejoicing  Girls  at
the same age  suffer a slight operation  intended to be analogous  and
called by the same name

In their processions and rejoicings on religious festivals and other
occasions  the Javans are free from that noisy clamour and uproar
which is usual with the Mahomedans of continental India  The ceremony
of  hÃºsen hÃ¡sen   which on the continent excites such a general noise
throughout the country  here passes by almost without notice  and the
processions of the Sepoys on this occasion  during the period of the
British government on Java  excited the utmost astonishment among
them  on account of their novelty  noise  and gaudy effect  but nobody
seemed inclined to join in  or to imitate them  indeed the Javans
have too chaste an ear to bear with pleasure the dissonant sounds and
unharmonious uproar of the Indians 205

The Mahomedan religion  as it at present exists on Java  seems only
to have penetrated the surface  and to have taken but little root in
the heart of the Javans  Some there are who are enthusiastic  and all
consider it a point of honour to support and respect its doctrines  but
as a nation  the Javans by no means feel hatred towards Europeans as
infidels   and this perhaps may be given as the best proof that they
are very imperfect Mahomedans  As another example of the very slight
hold which Mahomedanism has of them  may be adduced the conduct of the
reigning prince  the  SusÃºnan   in the recent conspiracy among the
Sepoys serving on Java  The intimacy between this prince and the Sepoys
first commenced from his attending the ceremonies of their religious
worship  which was Hindu  and assisting them with several idols of
that worship which had been preserved in his family  The conspirators
availing themselves of this predilection of the prince for the religion
of his ancestors  flattered him by addressing him as a descendant of
the great  RÃ¡ma   and a deliberate plan was formed  the object of which
was to place the European provinces once more under a Hindu power
Had this plan been attended with success  it would probably have been
followed by the almost immediate and general re conversion of the
Javans themselves to the Hindu faith 206

Whatever of their more ancient faith may remain in the institutions
habits  and affections of the Javans  the island abounds in less
perishable memorials of it  The antiquities of Java consist of ruins of
edifices  and in particular of temples sacred to the former worship
images of deities found within them  and scattered throughout the
country  either sculptured in stone or cast in metal  inscriptions on
stone and copper in ancient characters  and ancient coins

The antiquities of Java have not  till lately  excited much notice
nor have they yet been sufficiently explored  The narrow policy
of the Dutch denied to other nations facilities of research  and
their own devotion to the pursuits of commerce was too exclusive to
allow of their being much interested by the subject  The numerous
and interesting remains of former art and grandeur  which exist in
the ruins of temples and other edifices  the abundant treasures of
sculpture and statuary with which some parts of the island are covered
and the evidences of a former state of religious belief and national
improvement  which are presented in images  devices  and inscriptions
either lay entirely buried under rubbish  or were but partially
examined  Nothing  therefore  of the ancient history of the people
of their institutions prior to the introduction of Mahomedanism  of
their magnificence and power before the distraction of internal war
and the division of the country into petty contending sovereignties
or of their relations either to adjacent or distant tribes  in their
origin  language  and religion  could be accurately known or fully
relied on  The grandeur of their ancestors sounds like a fable in the
mouth of the degenerate Javan  and it is only when it can be traced in
monuments  which cannot be falsified  that we are led to give credit
to their traditions concerning it  Of these monuments  existing in
great profusion in several places  and forming  if I may so express
myself  the most interesting part of the annals of the people  none
are so striking as those found at  BrambÃ¡nan  in  MatÃ¡rem   near the
middle of the island  at  BÃ³ro BÃ³do  in  KÃ©du   on  GÃºnung PrÃ¡hu  and
its vicinity  in  KedÃ­rÃ­   and at  Sing a SÃ¡ri  in the district of
MÃ¡lang   in the eastern part of the island

In addition to their claims on the consideration of the antiquarian
the ruins at two of these places   BrambÃ¡nan  and  BÃ³ro BÃ³do   are
admirable as majestic works of art  The great extent of the masses of
building covered in some parts with the luxuriant vegetation of the
climate  the beauty and delicate execution of the separate portions
the symmetry and regularity of the whole  the great number and
interesting character of the statues and bas reliefs  with which they
are ornamented  excite our wonder that they were not earlier examined
sketched  and described

With respect to the ruins at  BrÃ¡mbanan   we find  upon the authority
of a Dutch engineer  who in 1797 went to construct a fort at  KlÃ¡ten
on the highway between the two native capitals  and not far from the
site of the temples  that no description of its antiquities existed at
that period  He found great difficulty in clearing away the rubbish
and plants  so as to obtain a view of the ruins and to be enabled
to sketch them  The indifference of the natives had been as great
as that of their conquerors  and had led them to neglect the works
of their ancestors which they could not imitate  They had allowed a
powerful vegetation  not only to cover the surface of the buildings
but to dislocate and almost to overthrow them  They still viewed with
veneration  however  the most conspicuous statue in the ruins  and in
spite of their Mahomedan principles  add
