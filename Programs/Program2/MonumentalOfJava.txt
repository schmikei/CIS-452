If this book needs an apology  it is one to myself for taking the public
at large into the confidence of cherished recollections  The writing
was a diversion from studies in a quite different direction and letting
my pen go  while living again the happy hours I spent  between arduous
duties  with the beautiful monuments of Java s past  I did nothing but
seek my own pleasure  Should it turn out that my personal impressions
given in black and white  please others too  so much the better  In any
case they must be taken for what they are  a beguilement of lone moments
of leisure

Whoever find them readable  they will not satisfy  I hope  a certain
class of critics  those  I mean  who extend the paltry rule of mutual
admiration   nul n aura de l esprit que nous et nos amis   to any
field they claim their own and  of whom to be dispraised were no small
praise   Desirous  I must confess  to stimulate their flattering
disapproval  I hasten to admit in advance my many shortcomings  a full
list of which they will doubtless oblige me with in due process of
censorious comment  My work sets up no pretence to completeness  there
is no full enumeration of all the Hindu and Buddhist temples known by
their remains  there are no measurements  no technical details  no
statistics  a great recommendation to my mind  as Dutch East Indian
statistics go  I am not guilty of an ambitious attempt to enrich the
world with an exhaustive treatise on ancient Javanese architecture and
sculpture  far be it from me to harbour such an audacious design  I
disclaim even the presumption to aspire at being classed as a useful
companion on a visit to the island  I deny most emphatically that I
intend to swell the disquieting number of tourists  vade mecums already
up for sale  clamouring for recognition  and   horribile dictu   scores
more coming  Be they sufficient or insufficient  qualitatively speaking
I am not going to increase their quantity

So much for what this book is not  What it is  I could not help making
it  choosing from the material stored in my memory  reliving  as fancy
dictated in long northern winter evenings  the sunny spells between
1874 and 1903 when I might call Java my home  resuming my walks in the
charming island pleasance of the East  fain to leave the congested main
roads and disport myself along by paths and unfrequented lanes where
solace and repose await the weary wanderer  The undertaking  somewhat
too confidently indicated by the title  tempted to excursions off the
beaten historical  geographical and archaeological tracks  which
perhaps will contribute to a better understanding of the monuments
described in their proper setting  their relations to natural scenery
and native civilisation  but certainly do not tend to conformity with
the regulation style of compositions of the kind  Invoking the aid of
Ganesa  the sagacious guide  countenancer of poor mortals in creative
throes  for  thank Heaven  the fever of production is indissolubly one
with the anguish that heightens its delights   I never hesitated in
letting the idea of self gratification prevail  even when the question
of illustration arose after the plan had ripened of inviting indulgent
readers to partake  In this respect too I struggled free from anxious
deliberation   Wer gar zu viel bedenkt  wird wenig leisten   And  Ganesa
aiding  the following kaleidoscopic view of the land I love so well  was
the result of my delicious travail

Looking for the flowers in the ill kept garden of Java  the
delinquencies of the gardeners could not be ignored and here I touch
the unpleasant side of the recreation I sought  especially disagreeable
when proposing to strangers that they should share  but a picture needs
shade as well as light to become intelligible  And to paint true to life
the picture of Dutch East Indian passivity  activity only in vandalism
regarding treasures of art inconvertible into cash  shade ought to be
preponderant and light relegated to the subordinate place of a little
star glimmering dimly in the darkness  a little star of hope for the
future  Disinclined  however  to spoil my pleasure by dwelling on the
tenebrous general aspect of governmental archaeology in the past  I
have no more than mentioned such disgraceful incidents as the Mendoot
squabbles  and omitted   e g    all reference to such ludicrously heated
controversies as that about the  kala makara  versus the  garuda naga
ornament  exhaustive of the energy which the officially learned might
have employed to so much greater advantage by rescuing the venerable
temples they fought over  from decay and willful demolition

The neglect of the ancient monuments of Java has been nothing short
of scandalous  the evil effects of the habitual languid detachment of
the colonial authorities from the business they are supposed to look
after  being  in their case  intensified by acts of dilapidation which
even a Government centuries back on the road of enlightenment would
have checked  1  not to speak of downright plunder and theft  The more
honour deserve men like Junghuhn among the dead and Rouffaer among the
still living  who lifted their voice against the intolerable negligence
which hastened the ruin of some of the finest existing specimens of
Hindu and Buddhist architecture  At last  in 1901  an Archaeological
Commission was appointed  whose labours were directed by Dr  J  L
A  Brandes  their head and soul  After his regretted death in 1905
he was succeeded by Dr  N  J  Krom  who has no easy task in fanning
the spark  struck by his predecessor from the hard flint of official
laisser aller  into a steady  bright flame of real  continuous
solicitude for the country s antiquities

Antiquities  except when sold  do not bring money to the exchequer  and
the Dutch Government s most holy colonial traditions are diametrically
opposed to expenses without promise of immediate pecuniary profit  If
sympathies in matters alien to that prime purpose are miraculously
aroused  such interest  revealing itself at the very best by fits and
starts to serve ambitious schemes  soon flags and dies  Especially in
Dutch East Indian enthusiasm for enterprises financially uncommendable
the adage holds good that  tout lasse  tout casse  tout passe   The
efforts of the Archaeological Commission can be traced only at the
respectful distance of at least a couple of years  the drowsy dignity
of red tapeism putting as long a space as possible between the vulgar
gaze of the unofficially curious and the official accounts of things
accomplished  meetly compiled  arranged  amended  corrected  revised
purged  padded and bolstered up by the editing experts of successively
the circumlocution offices at Batavia  Buitenzorg and the Hague  The
reports  published in this manner  whatever they represent as having
been done  lay no stress  of course  upon what has been left undone
upon the architectural marvels unprovided for  still suffered to
crumble away  to be stripped and demolished  the valuable statuary
and ornaments to be carried off piecemeal by unscrupulous collectors
the lower priced stones they left  sculptured or not  by the builders
of private dwellings and factories  of Government bridges  dams and
embankments

The illustrations  inserted to explain  imperfect though it be
the charm of the temple ruins I treated of  are reproductions of
photographs  taken for the Dutch East Indian Archaeological Service
I obtained from Messrs  Charls and van Es at Weltevreden  by courtesy
of Dr  N  J  Krom  and of photographs taken for the Centrum Company
at Batavia  and by Mr  C  Nieuwenhuis and the late Cephas Sr  at
Jogjakarta  The work of restoration can be appreciated from the
photo prints of the  chandi  Pawon and  with respect to the  chandis
Mendoot and Boro Budoor  from those facing pp  215 and 280  they are
the numbers 24 and 40 on the list of the illustrations  and I owe
them to Major T  van Erp  also through the intermediary of Dr  Krom
My indebtedness for the text so far as it does not rest on personal
observation and information obtained in the localities referred to  is
a very large one to many authors on many subjects separately specified
in the notes  Concerning the historical parts  I beg leave to state
that my readings on controversial points have been determined by a
careful sifting of the most acceptable theories advanced  at the risk of
critics of the stamp alluded to  proving my preferred records absolutely
inadmissible  If so  I having pulled the long bow  Ã  l instar  of the
annalists and chroniclers of ancient Java  and consequently being shown
up for indicating the way in which things did not happen and could not
have happened  instead of sticking to the historical truth agreed upon
until one of the hall marked omniscient makes a name for himself by
inducing the others to agree upon something else  my sin falls back on
the shoulders of the  savants  prone to lead their admirers astray by
their occasional imitation of the eminent historian at whose inborn
disrespect for facts Professor Freeman used to poke fun  I am afraid
that the system of transliteration I adopted  will also meet with scant
recognition in the same quarter  but finding none that  strictly carried
through  adjusts itself equally well to the exigencies both of Javanese
and Malay names and expressions  I shall adhere to this one until taught
better

This must suffice for a preface if  indeed  it does not exceed the
measure allowed by my readers  patience  Knowing Java  they will
however  excuse my fervour in introducing reminiscences of beauty
breathing scenes which  once enjoyed  linger like delights in memory

                    the memory of a dream
   Which now is sad because it hath been sweet

Not knowing Java yet  they will forgive later  when they have visited
the matchless old shrines  images of her past and symbolic of her hopes
for blessings hidden in the womb of time  when they have tried to read
the riddle of her children s destiny in the Boro Budoor

            seated in an island strong
   Abounding all with delices most rare

CHAPTER I

THE COUNTRY  THE PEOPLE AND THEIR WORK

   It is the crowning virtue of all great Art that  however little
   is left of it by the injuries of time  that little will be lovely
   JOHN RUSKIN   Mornings in Florence  Santa Croce


Java s ancient monuments are eloquent evidence of that innate
consciousness of something beyond earthly existence which moves men to
propitiate the principle of life by sacrifice in temples as gloriously
divine as mortal hand can raise  Fear  however  especially where
Buddhism moulded their thought by contemplation intent upon absorption
of self  entered little into the religion of the children of this pearl
of islands  Nature  beautiful  almighty nature  guided them and their
work  even the terror inspired by the cosmic energy throbbing under
their feet  by frequent volcanic upheavals dealing destruction and
death  flowered into promise of new joy  thanks to the consummate art of
their builders and sculptors  whose master minds  conceiving grandly
devising boldly and finishing with elaborate ornament  emphasised most
cunningly the lofty yet lovely majesty of their natural surroundings
They made them images of the Supreme Being in his different aspects and
symbolised attributes  free from the abject dread which dominated his
worship by other earthlings of his fashioning in other climes  whose
notion of All Power was more one of Vengeance than of All Sufficiency
They lived and meditated and wrought  impressing their mentality upon
the material world given for their use  and so they created marvels of
beauty  developed an architecture which belongs pre eminently to their
luxuriant soil under the clear blue of their sky  in the brilliant light
of their sun

Truly high art ever shows a natural fitness  as we can observe in our
gothic cathedrals  in the classic remains of Hellas  including those
of Magna Graecia  the temples of Poseidonia  Egesta and Acragas  the
theatres of Syracuse and Tauromenium  gates opened to the splendour
of heaven and earth by the undying virtue of mortal endeavour  Other
countries  other revelations of the divine essence in human effort  but
not even the shrines of India as I came to know them  born of a common
origin with Javanese religious structures in almost similar conditions
of climate  physical needs  moral aspirations  can equal their stately
grandeur balanced by exquisite elegance  calm yet passionate  always in
keeping with the dignified repose of landscapes which at any moment may
have their charms dissolved in earthquakes  fire and ashes  Angkor Vat
turned from the service of four faced Brahma to Buddhist self negation
stands perhaps nearest in the happy effect produced  if not in outline
And what is the secret of that quiet  subtle magic exercised by the
builders of Java  Nothing but a matter of technical skill  of such a
control over the practical details of their craft as  for instance  made
them scorn metal bindings  while using mortar only to a very limited
extent  Or was it their faith  leavening design and execution  attaching
the master s seal to general plan and minutest ornamental scroll  In
this connection it seems worthy of remark that architect and sculptor
though independent in their labours  with the exception of one or two
edifices of a late date   achieved invariably  in the distribution of
surfaces and decoration  both as to front and side elevations  complete
unity of expression of the fundamental idea

Geographically  the ancient monuments of Java may be divided into
three main groups  a western one  rather scanty and confined to a
comparatively small area  a central one  rich both in SivaÃ¯te and
Buddhist temples of the highest excellence  an eastern one  including
Madura and Bali  illustrative of the island s Hindu art in its
decadence  Taking it roughly  the order is also chronologically from
West to East  and to a certain extent we can trace the history of the
remarkable people who improved so nobly upon the ideas they received
from India  in the ruins they left to our wondering gaze  There has
been a good deal of controversy respecting the date up to which the
inhabitants of Java developed themselves on lines of aboriginal thought
before the advent of the Hindus or  more correctly speaking  before
Hindu influences became prevalent  In fact  there is hardly any question
regarding the history of the island and its civilisation before the
white conquerors carried everything before them  which has not given
rise to controversy  and many important points are still very far
from being settled  perhaps they never will be  In the face of such
disagreement it behoves us to go warily and what follows hereafter rests
but on arguments  pro  and  contra  deemed most plausible and founded
principally on the accounts of the  babads  or Javanese chronicles  2
always liable to correction when new discoveries with new wordy battles
in their wake bring new light  if they do  Rude attempts at rock carving
near Karang Bolong  Sukabumi  and Chitapen  Cheribon  are ascribed by
some to artists of the pre Hindu period  Professor J  H  C  Kern s
reading of inscriptions on four monoliths in Batavia  glorifications
of a certain king Purnavarman  proves that the first Hindus of whom we
have knowledge in Java  were Vaishnavas  Then comes a blank of several
centuries while they made their way to Central and East Java where
however  when the veil is partly lifted  the Saivas predominate  almost
swamping the rival sect  Fa Hien  the Chinese pilgrim who visited the
island in 412 or 413  having suffered shipwreck on its coast  speaks of
Brahmanism being  in floribus  and making converts  but complains of
Buddhism as still of small account among the natives

The strangers arrived in increasing numbers on the hospitable shores
of the good and generous  negri jawa   whose kindly reception of those
adventurers is marvellously well represented on two of the sculptured
slabs of the Boro Budoor  a tale of rescue from the dangers of the sea
a picture of the past and a prophetic vision of the welcome extended in
later days also to Muhammadans and Christians  to be how repaid  The
Hindus acquitted their debt of gratitude by building and carving with
an energy  to quote James Fergusson  and to an extent nowhere surpassed
in their native lands  dignifying their new home with imperishable
records of their art and civilisation     The Venggi inscriptions of
the DiÃ«ng and the Kadu leave no doubt that the oldest manifestations
of HinduÃ¯sm in Central and West Java were intimately related
and that the first strong infusion of the imported creed must
have operated until 850 Saka  A D  928   In 654 Saka  A D  732
according to an inscription found at Changgal  Kadu  the ruler of
the land bore a Sanskrit name and sacrificed to Siva  erecting a
linga   3  An inscription of 700 Saka  A D  778   found at Kalasan
Jogjakarta  is Buddhistic and confirms the evidence of many other
records carved in stone and copper  of the oldest Javanese literature
last but not least of the temple ruins  all concurring in this that the
two religions flourished side by side  the adoration of the Brahman
triad  led by Siva  acquiring a tinge of the beatitude derived from
emancipation through annihilation of self  Buddhism  in its younger
mahayana  form  becoming strongly impregnated with SivaÃ¯sm  to the
point even of endowing the Adi Buddha in his five more tangible
personifications with spouses and sons  Between two currents of faith
each imbued with the male and female principle in a country where the
problem of sex will not be hid  it depended often upon a trifle what
kind of emblematic shape the sculptor was going to give to his block of
stone  whether he would carve a  linga  or a  yoni   4  a Dhyani Buddha
a Bodhisatva  a Tara or one of her Hindu peers

Subsequent waves of immigration  the Muhammadan invasion  the Christian
conquests  did little to nourish the artistic flame  on the contrary
they damped artistic ardour  Hereanent our historical data are somewhat
more precise  The IslÄm takes its way to Sumatra in the wake of trade
conversions  en masse  seem to have first occurred in Pasei and Acheh
while merchants of Arabian and Persian nationality prepared its advent
also in other regions of the north and later of the west coast  Marco
Polo speaks of a Muhammadan principality in the North at the end of the
thirteenth century  Ibn Batutah of several more in 1345  Acheh is fully
islÄmised under Sooltan Ali Moghayat Shah  1507 1522  about the same
time Menangkabau  ruled by maharajahs proud of their descent in the
right line from Alexander the Great  Iskander Dzu l Karnein  reaches
its apogee as a formidable Moslim state and remains the stronghold of
Malayan true believers until the fanaticism of the  padris   stirred
by the Wahabite movement  ends  in 1837  in the submission of the last
Prince of Pagar Rujoong to the Dutch Government  which annexes his
already much diminished empire  About 1400 the IslÄm had been introduced
into Java  Zabej  as the Arabs called it  probably via Malacca and
Sumatra  more especially Palembang  The oldest effort recorded was that
of a certain Haji Poorwa in Pajajaran  but it appears not to have met
with great success  Gresik in East Java  a port of call frequented by
many oriental skippers  offered a better field for the religious zeal
of Arab sailing masters  supercargoes and tradesmen  every one of them
a missionary too  Maulana Malik Ibrahim secured the largest following
and was succeeded in his apostolic work by Raden Paku  who settled at
Giri  not far from Gresik  whence his title of Susuhunan Giri  and by
Raden Rahmat  who married a daughter of Angka Wijaya  King of Mojopahit
and founded a Muhammadan school at Ngampel  Surabaya  Their teachings
resulted soon in the conversion of the population of the northeast coast
of the island  where Demak  Drajat  Tuban  Kalinjamat and a few smaller
vassal states of Mojopahit made themselves independent under Moslim
princes or  walis   who at last combined for a holy war against Hindu
supremacy  They wiped Mojopahit in her idolatrous wickedness from the
face of the earth and the leadership went to Demak  from which Pajang
derived its political ascendency to merge later in Mataram  While the
IslÄm spread from Giri in East and Central Java  even to Mataram and
crossing the water  to Madura  by the exertions of saintly men who
knew the future   an Arab sheik  arriving at Cheribon  directly from
foreign parts  at some time between 1445 and 1490  Noor ad Din Ibrahim
bin Maulana IsraÃ¯l  better known as Sunan Gunoong Jati  undertook
the conversion of West Java  And of Cheribon in her relation to the
Pasoondan may be repeated what a Javanese historian said of Demak  where
the Evil One was outwitted by the building of a  mesdjid   a Muhammadan
house of prayer  the oldest in the island  two human virtues remained
so many as embraced the true religion went after them

The two remaining virtues got hard pressed when Christian strangers
came to explore and exploit  Portuguese  English and Dutch  the latter
dominant up to this day  Viewed from the standpoint of the dominated
their god was a god of plunder  their emblem  to suit the symbolism
of the Hindu Pantheon  was a  maryam   a heavy piece of ordnance
their  vahana   the animal representative of their most characteristic
qualities  was the tiger   machan  still being synonymous with  orang
wolanda   Hollander  in confidential  figurative speech  How Skanda
the deity of war  incited and Kuwera  the corpulent bestower of riches
directed their warriors and negotiators after the appearance of Cornelis
Houtman s ships in the Bay of Bantam  need not detain us  That story of
the past  with a hint at the possible future  is told in the legend of
the legitimately wedded but for the time cruelly separated  maryams
of which one  very appropriately  awaits the fulfilment of a prophecy
at the capital of the intruders  and the other where they first put
foot on land  both being objects of veneration and granters of desires
especially kind to barren women who come  in a spirit of humiliation  to
pray for the blessing of motherhood  A visit to Batavia is not complete
without a pilgrimage to the Pinang gate  once an approach to the East
India Company s castle  now in its supernatural cleanness  with its
hideously black funeral urns and statues of Mars and Mercury or whoever
they may be  giving access to the old town  the first public monument
which attracted the attention of young Verdant Green in the age of
sailing vessels after he had paid his due to the customs at the  boom
Not far from that Pinang gate  symbolic of a colonial system under
which short weight flourished with forced labour and trade carried on at
the edge of the sword  lies the man cannon  Kiahi Satomo  whose pommel
presents a hand  closed so as to make the gesture of contempt   la
fica   which Vanni Fucci of Pistoja permitted himself when interrogated
in the abode of despair by the poet   quem genuit parvi Florentia mater
amoris   and which accounts for the peculiar forms sacrifice assumes at
this altar  His favourite spouse  discovered floating on the sea near
old Bantam  an extraordinary thing to do for such a big heavy piece of
metal  was given a temporary home on the spot where finally she lay
down to rest from her travels  a certain Haji Bool built her a bambu
house after the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883  her presence having saved
Karang Antu from the fate of Anyer and Cheringin  Waiting for the great
consummation  when her reunion with her lord at Batavia will announce
the hour of the oppressors  defeat and their expulsion from Java  she
is not less honoured than he  Dressed in a white cloth  which covers
the circular inscription in Arabic characters on breech and cascabel
while the priming hole is decorated in square ornament  with five solid
rings to facilitate conveyance if she prefers being carried to moving
by her own exertion as of yore  anointed and salved with  boreh   5
the spouse  expecting the summons in the fragrance of incense and
flowers   kananga  and  champaka   is often surrounded by fervent
devotees  muttering their  dzikr  on their prayer mats  grateful for
bounty received or hopeful of future delivery from bondage  Husband and
wife will meet and then a third cannon  far away in Central Java  in the
aloon aloon  6  before the  kraton  6  of the Susuhunan of Surakarta
inhabited by a ghost  dispenser of dreams  the  sapu jagad   will
vindicate that name   broom of the world   by sweeping all infidels into
the sea  Though the scoffing unbeliever counts this a dream of dreams
to the confiding children of the land it is a disclosure of things
hidden in the womb of time  not the less true because Kiahi Satomo has
an older mate  Niahi Satomi  the wife of his youth  the robed in red of
the Susuhunan s artillery park  which glories in many  maryams  renowned
in myth and history  among them another married couple  Koomba rawa
and Koomba rawi  who shielded the ancient Sooltans of Pajang  being
the official defenders of their palace  But Kiahi Satomo s heart is in
Bantam  at Karang Antu  as Niahi Satomi has reason to suspect since
she  the more legitimate and more advanced in age  cannot keep him at
her side  It avails nothing that the Susuhunan s retainers chain the
reluctant head of the family to the Bangsal Pangrawit  the imperial
audience chamber constructed after a heavenly model in gold  always and
always he flies back to Batavia  anxious to be ready where the beloved
bini muda   lit  young wife  has trysted him for sweet dalliance  from
which victory will be born and release

While predictions of the kind may be laughed at  the native belief in
them and the foundations on which that belief rests  are no laughable
matter by any means  Stories of mythical beings like Kiahi Satomo
and Niahi Satomi  transformed into pieces of ordnance connected with
the legendary lore of Trunajaya on one side and Moslim fanaticism
personified in the cannon of Karang Antu on the other  prove that the
native mind is still strongly imbued with pre Muhammadan and even
pre Hindu ideas and modes of thought  Its imagination is fed by the
fortunes  and misfortunes   of an island which may be compared in the
heterogeneous factors of its culture with Sicily  where Greek colonists
built their temples in the high places of aboriginal idolatry  and
the Saracens constructed their qubbehs overtopping the churches and
cloisters into which the Christians had transformed the cellae and
colonnades consecrated to Zeus  Hera  Poseidon  Aphrodite  Pallas
Athene  Artemis  the Dioscuri  and the Normans added their arched
doorways and massive masonry to perplex posterity entirely  In Java
the Hindu element  with a strong Buddhist admixture  predominates  it
prevails wholly in ancient architectural activity  not to speak of
Soondanese and Javanese folklore and literature  while later Christian
influence is negligible if not negative  Everywhere in the island we
find under the Muhammadan coating the old conceptions of life from
which the Loro Jonggrang group and the Boro Budoor sprang  scratch the
orang slam  and the Saiva or Buddhist will immediately appear  As the
Padang Highlands  which preserve the traditions of Menangkabau  still
ring with the fame of the Buddhist King Adityawarman  and scrupulously
Moslim Palembang still cherishes the memory of Buddhist San bo tsaÃ¯
while South Sumatra clings to Hindu customs and habits for all its
submission to IslÄm  so Java reveres whatever has been handed down from
her pantheistic  tempo dahulu   time of yore   however attached to the
law of the Prophet  SivaÃ¯sm and Buddhism were deeply rooted in the
island  if the political power of its old creeds was broken in 1767 with
the taking of Balambangan  HinduÃ¯sm nevertheless lingering among the
Tenggerese and in Bali  their spirit goes on leavening the new doctrine
and we meet with their symbolism at every turn  Not to mention Central
Java  where especially in Surakarta and Jogjakarta their tenacious
sway strikes the most casual observer  the great staircase of the
Muhammadan sanctum at Giri is adorned with a huge  naga   the worshipful
rain cloud descending in the likeness of a serpent  despite the QorÄnic
injunction to abstain from the representation of animate creation  The
pillars of reception halls and audience chambers in the houses of the
high and mighty  East and West  bear a remarkable resemblance to the
linga   witness   e g    the  kedaton  7  built by the Sooltan Sepooh
Martawijaya of Cheribon  a Moslim prince who ought to have evinced the
strongest repugnance to Siva s prime attribute

Under the circumstances we need not wonder that the IslÄm did so little
to stimulate art in Java  Christianity did still less  rather clogged
it in its application to native industries  which suffered from the
country being flooded with stuff as cheap as possible in every respect
but sold at the highest possible prices to benefit manufacturers in
Europe  This is not the place to expatiate on this subject nor to
discuss present efforts  in which alas  personal ambitions play first
fiddle and jeopardise results  to revive what lies at the point of
death after centuries of culpable discouragement  the professional
secrets and peculiar devices of native arts and crafts  requiring
hereditary skill and the delicate touch of experienced fingers to attain
former perfection  being now already half forgotten or altogether
lost  Concerning the ancient monuments of Java  it is to the British
Interregnum  to Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles that we owe the first
measures for their preservation and the first systematic survey of
specimens of Hindu workmanship as beautiful as any in the world  more
in particular of the Prambanan temples  and also of the Boro Budoor  by
common consent the masterpiece of Buddhist architecture  Marshalling
his assistants in the archaeological field  especially Cornelius and
Wardenaar  whose fruitful explorations and excavations deserved fuller
acknowledgment than they received from him   a diligent student besides
of the history and literature of the island  doing for Java in that
respect what Marsden had done for Sumatra  he inspired Dr  Leyden
Colonel Mackenzie and his rival John Crawfurd among his contemporaries
and of younger generations now equally gone  Wilsen  Leemans  Brumund
Friederich  Junghuhn  Cohen Stuart  Holle    j en passe et des
meilleurs   The value of their labours must be recognised and it is
the fault of the Dutch Government s apathetic attitude that with such
forces at its disposal  so little has been achieved  Each of them  with
few exceptions  worked independently of the other and blazed his own
personal path in the wilderness of Dutch East Indian antiquities  There
was  as Fergusson complained  no system  no leading spirit to give
unity to the whole  Disconnected  sometimes misdirected investigation
did not result in more than an accumulation of fragmentary material
for possible future use   rudis indigestaque moles   And meanwhile the
glorious remains of a lost civilisation went more and more to ruin  They
were drawn upon for purposes of public and private building  statues
and ornament disappeared  not only in consequence of the unchecked
persistent nibbling of the tooth of time  and it seemed almost so much
gained if Doorga or Ganesa reappeared occasionally in the function of
domestic goddess or god to some Resident or Assistant Resident who
demonstrated his devotion to ancient art and care for the preservation
of its masterpieces by a periodical process of whitewashing or tarring
Worse than that  dilettantism began to tamper with the finest temples
and the miserable bungling of mischievous  quasi scientific enthusiasts
reached its climax in the sorry spectacle prepared for the visitors of
the last international exhibition in Paris  1900   There was to be seen
in the Dutch East Indian section  a mean  ridiculous imitation of one
of the Buddhist jewels of Central Java  a caricature of the  chandi  8
Sari  the exterior in nondescript confectioner s style  daubed dirty
white  the interior made hideous by a purple awning  abomination heaped
on abomination  And that piteous botch  in fact an unconscious avowal of
Dutch colonial shortcomings  did service as a sample of  la magnificence
d une religion prodigue en ornaments  en feuillages et en voluptÃ©s

After an era of dabbling by pseudo Winckelmanns and Schliemanns
spicing their pretences with mutual admiration  the Government decided
finally to appoint a permanent Archaeological Commission  Things
indeed  had come to such a pass that there was danger in delay  the
island is becoming more and more accessible to globe trotters of all
nationalities  not a few of whom publish their impressions  and if
erring authority wields a vigorous Press Law to silence criticism at
home  against foreign criticism it has no weapon of the kind  however
touchy it may be  So it began to move and the Archaeological Commission
short for Commission for Archaeological Research in Java and Madura
though without a single trained archaeologist among its members
displayed at once a good deal of activity under its first President
Dr  J  L  A  Brandes  exploring in East Java  restoring the  chandi
Toompang  attending to the Mendoot and Boro Budoor in Central Java  in
order that  acting upon King Pururava s injunction  at last understood
and accepted  after a fashion  by Batavia and the Hague  no monument
shall be lost which has been wrought in the right spirit  It can be
imagined that subordinate officials  eager to follow their superiors
lead  now revel daily in numberless finds  reported not only from
districts  near and remote  in the star island  but from the exterior
possessions  from Soombawa  from Jambi in Sumatra  from Kutei in East
from Sanggau and Sakadan in West Borneo  etc  etc  Like the encouraging
of native art applied to weaving  wood carving  the manufacture of
pottery  of household utensils of copper and bronze  and so on  the
ferreting out of sculptural and architectural ties with the past is
quite the latest craze  a stepping stone to preferment or at least a
means of ingratiation with those who set the pace  There would be no
harm in this if obsequious ambition did not burgeon here and there into
an excess of zeal which makes one tremble  pregnant as it proves to be
with dangers well defined by Ruskin  Of all destructive manias that of
restoration is the frightfullest and foolishest

Curiosity being excited  there is the impulse to satisfy vulgar demands
to cater to coarse appetites when admitting every one who knocks at the
door of the treasure house however unworthy  Trippers from the trading
centres on the coast swarm round as their fancies guide  tourists from
distant climes scour the land  either single spies or driven in noisy
battalions of  conducted parties   Travel in Java is already assuming
the character of holiday excursions pressed upon the public in bombastic
handbills and posters of transportation companies  Revenue being the
principal objective of Dutch colonial solicitude  the opportunity
they create is gladly seized to levy gate money from visitors to the
chandi  Mendoot  9  And since the Philistines  who do not appreciate
the beauties of a building they cannot comprehend  expect something
in exchange for their contribution to the upkeep  visible tokens of
their really having been there  we shall soon hear of photographers
established in the temple to perpetuate the memory of spoony couples
giggling and offensive  magnesium flashed at the feet of the Most
Venerable  or of the Boro Budoor in a blaze of Bengal fire to please
mediocrity  which wants barbarous stimulants  And apart from such
concessions to the exigencies of inane modern travel  how distressing
the plain tokens of neglect and spoliation  As Psyche began to mourn
Love after she had come to grasp his excellence  so the discerning
one  advancing to the apprehension of eternal truth there enshrined in
beauty  a call to heaven in stone  laments less what is gone of material
substance by the ravages of time  than what is taken from the spiritual
essence by willful mutilation  by methods of repair embodied in iron
scrapers to remove moss and weeds  incidentally spoiling the delicate
lines of reliefs and decoration  by filling gaps with any rubbish
lying about  mending and patching  Ã  la grosse morbleu   by additions
for the convenience of sightseers  like the unsightly staircase askew
near one of the original  dilapidated approaches  It is devoutly to be
hoped that the overhauling now in progress will  at least  remove such
incongruities and avoid new horrors of so called restoration  10

Dr  Brandes  whose learning and good sense led the Archaeological
Commission in a track of sound activity  died  unfortunately  in
1905  Though the theft of antiquities has been discontinued on paper
impudent souvenir hunting is still winked at by authorities fawning
on distinguished guests  Untitled and unofficial collectors will have
some trouble perhaps  at any rate incur a good deal more expense than
formerly  in filling their private art galleries  but for officials
of the type of Nicolaus Engelhard 11  no difficulties seem to exist
and even the Boro Budoor was very recently despoiled to please a
royal personage  So much for Java  as to the exterior possessions
the Minahassa was plundered  even more recently  for the benefit of
foreign explorers of name and fame  Since the respective Government
edicts 12  multiplied  fixing responsibility at random  cases of
strange disappearance multiplied too  on the principle  it seems  of
making hay while the sun shines  the pen driving departments  issuing
circulars on everything  for everything  against everything  about
everything  effect absolutely nothing unless their insistence be
taken  often rightly by him who reads between the lines  for a covert
invitation to do precisely the contrary  considering friendships  family
relations  party obligations  etc  etc   of powers and dominions
The force of regulations and rescripts in the Dutch East Indies is
notoriously short lived in the best of circumstances  and we have it on
the authority of Hans Sachs   Je mehr HÃ¼rten  je Ã¼bler Hut   The very
scrupulous and wise  moreover  drag off whatever is loose or can be
detached  separating details of ornament  reliefs and statues from their
surroundings  which are indispensable to their proper understanding  to
hide and forget them in cellars and lofts of museums until  the stars
being favourable  accidentally rediscovered after years and years  and
ticketed and huddled together with other ticketed objects in long
dreary rows of forbidding  bewildering aspect  That is   if  they are
rescued and classified and ticketed  tant bien que mal   the colonial
section in the Museum of Antiquities at Leyden  a byword among the
lovers of Dutch East Indian architecture  shows clearly the obstruction
caused by hopeless negligence in the past and lack of backbone in
the present zeal  energy  ardour  nay  frenzy of investigation
Everything in Dutch colonial affairs goes by fits and starts with long
blanks of indifference between  To give but one instance  the  Corpus
Inscriptionum Javanarum   planned with flourish of trumpets in 1843
still awaits the preliminaries of a beginning of execution  Concerning
the fever of restoration which has broken out  one feels inclined  in
support of Ruskin s opinion quoted above  to sound the note of warning
engraved on the signet ring of Prosper MÃ©rimÃ©e  Inspector of the
Historical Monuments of France almost a century ago  Î¼á½³Î¼Î½Î±Ïƒ  á¼€Ï€Î¹ÏƒÏ„Îµá¿–Î½
lest the last state become worse than the first  and excess of zeal
deface what time and the hand of man  even the Department of Public
Works itself  quarrying its material for bridges  dams  embankments
and the shapeless Government buildings of which it possesses the
monopoly  have left standing  Without  however  insisting on the
dark aspect of the situation  let us trust that a sense of shame  if
not of duty  will sustain the interest in the old monuments of Java
now in vogue  and may then the faddish  pompous display  turned into
channels of quiet  responsible  persistent endeavour  herald a brighter
day

CHAPTER II

WEST JAVA

   Quedaron mudos los cuerpos
   Solas las almas se hablan
   Que en las luces de los ojos
   Iban y venian las almas  13

    Romancero Morisco  Celin de Escariche


The Batu Tulis  lit   the inscribed stone   near Bogor  commemorates the
feats of a certain prince  Parabu Raja Purana  otherwise Ratu Dewata
and calls him the founder of Pakuan  ruler   maharajah ratu aji   of
Pakuan Pajajaran  That kingdom is the centre of everything tradition has
transmitted regarding the Hindus in West Java  Its origin  according to
native belief  goes back to a settlement of princely adventurers from
Tumapel in East Java  and when Mojopahit flourished after the fall of
that mighty empire  it rose to equal eminence at the other end of the
island  only to be destroyed by the same agency  the growing power of
IslÄm  The subjection of the mountain tribes of the Priangan by the
settlers from the East proceeded in the beginning but slowly and the
children of the land  even after they had yielded to the inevitable
must have retained a share in the management of their affairs  for
Soondanese  pantoons  14  mention separately  as two factors of
government  the  ratu   king of Pakuan  and the  menak   nobility of
Pajajaran  However this may be  from about 1100 until the beginning of
the sixteenth century  Pajajaran was a political unity that counted  She
could send an army of a hundred thousand warriors into the field  Her
kings disposed at will of large territories  gained by conquest  one of
them conferred upon his brother Kalayalang the dominion of Jayakarta
in later years better known under the name of Yacatra  and on his
brother Barudin the dominion of Bantam  principalities destined to play
an important part in the overthrow of the sovereign state  Nothing
save the meagre accounts of the  babads  and the scanty remains to be
referred to at the end of this chapter  reminds now of Pajajaran  except
the Badooy in South Bantam  who constitute a community apart  entirely
isolated from the rest of the population and whose peculiar customs and
religious observances so far as known  make it probable that they are
the descendants of fugitives before the Muhammadan inroad

When Noor ad Din Ibrahim bin Maulana IsraÃ¯l had established in Cheribon
not only his religion but also his political power  he began  under
the name and title of Sunan Gunoong Jati  to propagate the faith by
force of arms in the whole of West Java  First he cast his eyes on
Bantam  then a mighty realm  the possession or at least the control
of which  leaving spiritual motives alone  would materially benefit
Moslim trade by securing a free passage through the Straits of Soonda
whenever trouble with the Portuguese made the Straits of Malacca unsafe
The SivaÃ¯te Prince of Bantam  trying to preserve his independence by
fostering the commercial rivalry between his Muhammadan and Christian
friends  received the latter with open arms and besought their
assistance against Cheribon and Demak  but Maulana Hasan ad Din  a
son of Sunan Gunoong Jati  defeated him none the less and introduced
the IslÄm among his people both in Bantam proper and in the Lampongs
Another son of Sunan Gunoong Jati founded the Muhammadan principality
of Soonda Kalapa  notwithstanding the fortifications erected there
by the Portuguese  at the instance of their Bantamese ally  to stem
the tide of Muhammadan conquest  After subjugating the vassal state
Maulana Hasan ad Din attacked  about 1526  the troops of Pajajaran
under the King s son Sili Wangi  and routed them  taking the capital
and proselytising by the sword wherever he went  following the example
set by Raden Patah of Demak in East Java  It is probable that Bantam
once islÄmised and consequently turning against the Portuguese  took the
side of Cheribon in these wars  At any rate  we find Bantam and Cheribon
together acknowledging the suzerainty of Demak  like the more eastern
principalities of the north coast  and when that central Muhammadan
state of Java lost the hegemony in consequence of its breaking up
after the death of Pangeran Tranggana  and at last the Sooltan of
Pajang  15  into which it dissolved  had to humble himself with his
allies  the Adipati of Surabaya and the Sunan of Giri  before the
Senapati of Mataram  his former regent in that territory  this valiant
and clever potentate claimed the lordship over the island  These were
the beginnings of a glorious new Mataram  perhaps identical with Mendang
Kamulan

Cheribon  which had conquered Bantam and Pajajaran  lost gradually her
strength  became tributary to Mataram in 1625 and wholly dependent in
1632  She declined still more after the death of Panambahan Girilaya
who divided his succession between his sons Pangeran Martawijaya  later
Sooltan Sepooh  and Pangeran Kartawijaya  later Sooltan Anom   on
condition of their providing for a third son  Pangeran Wangsakarta
of Godong  later Panambahan   Embroiled in the rebellion of Trunajaya
against the authority of Mataram and captured  Martawijaya and
Kartawijaya were kept as hostages at its capital  Karta  Released
through the intervention of Sooltan Tirtayasa of Bantam  more commonly
known as Abu l Fatah  they returned home only to get again mixed up
in hostilities against Mataram and the Dutch East India Company
which overran Cheribon with its soldiers and improved the opportunity
by regulating the affairs of Girilaya s three sons to its own best
advantage  The foundation of Batavia on the site of old Yacatra  taken
by Jan Pietersz Coen  May 30  1619  had meant  among other things
an always keener competition in trade with Bantam or  rather  the
establishment of a free rendezvous    i e   free of bickerings with
native princes and princelings  for the fleets of the Company on their
long voyage to the Moluccos  Bantam having outstripped Cheribon by the
importance she derived from English and Dutch shipping  resented the
blow which threatened to relegate her to a second or third place  and
this resulted in frequent conflicts with the intruders  though the
boundary line of their settlement and their mutual relationship had been
carefully defined in the treaty of 1659  On the other side in occasional
difficulties with Mataram  the Company  acting on the  divide et impera
principle  encouraged the rivalry between the middle and western
empires  which both strove for supremacy in the Priangan  How the
Company accomplished its purpose and triumphed  needs here no detailed
examination  Its objects and the considerations which moved it  are
wittily discussed in a Javanese mock epic  the  Serat Baron Sakendher
a satire on the rise of Dutch power at Batavia  the foundation of Moor
Yang Koong  Jan Pietersz Coen   If that pattern of regents  outre
mer   the first Dutch Governor General in Java  whose motto was  never
despair   whose grip like the grip of the tiger  has invited comparison
with Ganesa  firstborn of Siva and Parvati  for wisdom and cautious
statecraft  with Skanda  also sprung from the Mahadeva s loins but
without the Devi s collaboration  for resolution and mettle  here we
find him as the son of Baron Sookmool  Baron Sakendher s brother
and Tanaruga  16  daughter of the Pajajaranese Princess Retna Sakar
Mandhapa  and the poet makes the personification of the Company say
to his twelve hopefuls  the earliest Tuan Tuan Edeleer  or honourable
members of the Governor General s Council  Good measures you will
enforce  without quarrelling amongst yourselves  and  even if it were
larceny  the moment you have decided upon it by common consent  I give
my permission   a speech delightfully in keeping with the tactics of his
father  whose artillery prevailed  not with iron cannon balls  but with
golden grapeshot of ducats and doubloons

The ruins of the Fort Speelwijck and the minaret of Pangeran Muhammad s
mesdjid  at Old Bantam are very illustrative of the insinuating way
in which the pioneers of the Company planted their factories  once
admitted on the strength of their promises  they gained a firm footing
by military superiority  driving hard bargains and ousting the IslÄm
from what it had come to regard as its own  Near by is the neglected
overgrown Dutch cemetery  where many of those pioneers were laid to
rest  far from home  family and friends  killed in the Company s battles
or by strenuous obedience to exacting orders  bartering their health in
a murderous climate for a handful of silver  wasting body and soul to
swell the Company s dividends  A tangle of weeds and briars closes over
their remains  thick moss  covering their broken gravestones  effaces
their forgotten names  even the mausoleums dedicated to the memory of
the leaders among them  commanders and commercial agents in chief  are
crumbling away  harbouring hungry guests which leave safe lairs in
the forests  when deer and wild pigs become scarce  to raid at night
the village sheepfolds  while snakes may dart forth from the cracks
and fissures at any moment and mosquitoes swarm round in myriads  the
worst plague of all to him who seeks communion with the dead in that
jungle  The burial ground of the Sooltans of Bantam  gathered round
Hasan ad Din  the first preacher of the true faith in this region  is
in better condition  Though Shafei  to whose  madsheb  or school the
Moslemin of the Dutch East Indies belong  disapproved of elaborate tombs
and prescribed that sepulchral cavities  after the deposition of the
bodies  should be filled up and made level with the ground  memorial
tokens to mark the graves of Muhammadan saints  famous princes and
heroes  often venerated as  kramats   are a familiar sight in Java
they consist generally of pieces of wood or stone   tengger   standing
upright at both ends  at the head and at the feet  differently shaped
for men and for women  Many such are found where Pangeran Muhammad
raised his  mesdjid  with the minaret detached like the campanile of
some mediaeval Italian church  Tombs all round  tombs of Sooltans
their brothers and sons and cousins  their great councillors and
generals  a Bantamese Aliscamps with Hasan ad Din occupying the place
of honour under a canopy  prayer mats and prayer books lying around
a benign breeze stirring the muslin hangings and filling the air with
the fragrance of the  kambojas   17  Whoever wants to know of the
excellent deeds of the Sooltans of Bantam  their acts of devotion in
peace and their prowess in war  can receive information from Pangeran
Muhammad Ali in  kampong  Kanari  one of their descendants  keeper
of the archives of the  mesdjid  and the surrounding garden of the
departed  He will tell furthermore of the well near the north wall
of the new building  which is fed from the well Zemzem at Mecca and
thanks to the child IshmaÃ¯l  beneath whose feet its water bubbled
forth  possesses the property of curing disease  It is also connected
with the miraculous source at Luar Batang  whose water possesses the
property of detecting perverters of the truth  the man who tries there
to slake his thirst with a falsehood on his conscience  from a downright
lie to a terminological inexactitude  or even a little fib for the
sake of domestic tranquillity  will not be able to swallow a drop  his
throat refusing liquid comfort until expiation of guilt  and so the
devotees who flock to the shrine of the saint of Hadramaut at Pasar
Ikan  Batavia  leave that source prudently alone  one may have sinned
unwittingly or under strong provocation  Such holy places are thickly
strewn and the last habitation of Hasan ad Din is one of the holiest
being overshadowed by the venerable minaret of Pangeran Muhammad s
mesdjid   which signified to Bantam what the  mesdjid  of Ngampel did
to the eastern and the  mesdjid  of Demak to the middle states of Moslim
Java  The intact preservation of the latter as the oldest existing
edifice erected 18  for Muhammadan worship in the island  is of high
importance  superstitionis causa   and exceeding care was taken in 1845
when the danger of its tumbling down became imminent  to rebuild it not
all at once  but one part after the other  round the four principal
supports of the original structure  and to restore the beautifully
carved lintels and posts exactly to their accustomed position  Nothing
is left at Demak of Raden Patah s princely dwelling  but the graves
are shown of Panambahan Jimboon  Pangeran Sabrang Lor and Pangeran
Tranggana  who was killed by one of his servants on an expedition to
still SivaÃ¯tic Pasuruan

Pangeran Tranggana had auxiliaries from Bantam among his troops and
this leads us back to West Java after our slight digression in favour
of Demak  the energetic central state which  at the time here spoken
of  ruled the roast in matters of conquest for the propagation of the
faith  The Bantamese  more than their converters  have conserved a
reputation for fanaticism and it is not yet a quarter of a century
since a certain Abool Karim of the district Tanara preached the
holy war  the brotherhood of the Naqshibendyah fanning the flame of
sedition he kindled  His  murids   disciples  Tubagoos IsmaÃ¯l  Marduki
and Wasid having spread the movement  a mob  led by a certain Haji
Iskak  massacred several Europeans at Chilegon  1888   But for the
Government s bayonets  rather than a course of conciliation based on a
thorough knowledge of the agrarian causes at the bottom of the unrest
among the population  the whole of Bantam might have blazed up and
Cheribon might have followed  Seeing that they could not prevail  the
dissatisfied betook themselves again to prayer  there at the grave of
Hasan ad Din  here at the grave of Sheik Noor ad Din Ibrahim  situated
not far from the capital he founded  on a hill near the sea  the
Gunoong Jati  whence his title  The terraces of the  astana  so called
first home of the IslÄm in this region  much venerated however much
defaced  savour of more ancient heathen monuments in all their odour
of Muhammadan sacredness  not otherwise than the  Kitab Papakam
the Cheribon code of laws  savours of Indian maxims and even at this
date betrays its birth from the legislation introduced by the Hindu
immigrants  though in 1768  and not before that year  more than three
centuries after the introduction of the law of the Prophet    the
Kutara Manawa  has officially been abrogated in the Sooltanate  The
lowest three terraces of the  astana  serve as a burial ground for the
descendants of Sunan Gunoong Jati and the men of mark in the annals of
his empire  a road  winding upward  a Moslim Via delle Tombe  conducts
the pilgrim to a  mesdjid  on the fourth  not to be desecrated by the
feet of unbelievers  19  above the  mesdjid   on the fifth  the  sanctum
sanctorum   rest the mortal remains of the saint himself  Speaking of
Cheribon in its relations to HinduÃ¯sm and the IslÄm  a reference to
Chinese influences on Javanese architecture cannot be omitted  They
are most evident  of course  where the sons of the Flowery Empire have
settled earliest and in greatest numbers  In several localities Chinese
temples are found for the building and decorating of which renowned
architects  wood carvers and painters have expressly been summoned to
Java at great expense  Reputedly the finest is the  klenteng   situated
at a stone s throw from the shed wherein Sunan Gunoong Jati s  grobak
is kept  the vehicle in which he descended from heaven to proclaim the
Word  Transplanting their curved roof trees and gaudy ornament  the
Chinese brought also a taste for grotto work  once notably conspicuous
in the  kraton  of Sooltan Anom  On the road to Tagal  near the
dessa   village  Sunyaragi  lies a rocky labyrinth belonging to the
pleasure grounds of Sooltan Sepooh s famous country seat  Among other
clever devices it contains an artificial cave so constructed that the
kanjeng goosti   retiring thither on a hot afternoon for dalliance
with his favourite of the hour  might shut himself completely off from
the world by a discreet artificial waterfall  securing privacy behind
its liquid screen and a refreshing atmosphere stimulative to amorous
exercise  The Chinaman who elaborated the idea  had his eyes gouged out
to prevent his creating another such wonder of architecture adapted to
the diversions of oriental potentates

It seems fitting that in Java  the sweet island whose air is balm and
where always the delicious sound of running water is heard  where
the cult of bathing is perfected by inclination as well as necessity
of climate  some of the oldest signs of civilisation are found in
sheltered nooks and corners still frequented by those who appreciate
an invigorating plunge  Kota Batu  near Bogor  the supposed site of
the capital of Pajajaran  is an instance in point  Destroyed  says
the Soondanese tradition  because the illustrious King Noro Pati had
lifted up his heart to boast against the message of the Prophet
his sons completed the calamity by their wrangling for the lordship
over outlying  as yet unsubjugated and unconverted dependencies  and
righteousness left the country  The same reasons which made Pajajaran
slow to accept the IslÄm  had hindered her acceptance of HinduÃ¯sm  The
mountainous Priangan was sparsely populated and  even if we accept the
statements of native historians who give Hindu civilisation in West Java
a long life by dating the colonisation from India back to the first
century of the Christian era  20  confined to a limited area  as the
antiquities discovered make clear  it remained far behind that which
reared the superb temples of Central Java  To the best of our knowledge
there were never any Hindu temples at all in West Java  where the people
seem to have contented themselves with prayer and sacrifice in the
open  While Central Java attained to the loftiest and noblest in art
West Java vegetated until improved communication  stimulated by war and
trade  brought about a dissemination of more eastern artistic notions
discernible in raised levels and terraces as those of Gunoong Jati
which remind one faintly of the Boro Budoor  in earthen walls as those
on the Bukit Tronggool  which are arranged after a plan somewhat like
that of the squares enclosing the principal temple and the surrounding
smaller ones of the  chandi  Sewu  Even then Polynesian clumsiness was
not shaken off  At Batu Tulis  a  kampong  in the outskirts of Bogor
where the hosts of two religions fought the battle which decided the
fate of Pajajaran  are several ungainly images and impressions of the
feet of Poorwakali  the spouse of one of that realm s petrified kings
who mourned him with such copious tears that she softened the very rock
she stood upon  according to one legend  and  according to another
legend  of the feet of a certain Raja Mantri who tarried so long in
contemplation of the inscribed stone already mentioned  pondering over
the meaning of its strange characters  that he sank gradually into the
hard ground  There are more impressions of more feet and a coarsely
carved  linga   Siva s fecundating attribute  transformed by Muhammadan
piety into the miracle working staff of a Moslim santon  Hardly greater
interest is awakened by the primitive statues Kota Batu derives its
appellation from   city of stones   which form a sort of  Ruhmes Allee
lining the path from the main road to the bath house  with many of the
same pattern scattered to right and left  All of them are petrified
worthies of Pajajaran  which their own mothers would not recognise
though the natives know each of them by praenomen  nomen  cognomen and
title  King Moonding Wangi   i e   the nice smelling buffalo  looking
perhaps a trifle more human than the rest  Of a similar nature are the
archadomas   a collection of about eight hundred blocks of stone on
the estate Pondok Gedeh  which need a vivid imagination in the beholder
to pass for the figures of men and animals  A good specimen of the
Pajajaran type of sculpture  if it deserves that name  is the lachrymose
Poorwakali already referred to as standing  petrified herself  at a
little distance from the Batu Tulis where she solaces her widowhood by
keeping company with Kidangpenanjong  forgetting her royal husband
after her paroxysm of grief  in a plebeian flirtation  Such is woman

From these crude attempts at a representation of animate creation
sprang nevertheless an art which  in the hands of the master builders
and sculptors of Central Java  who sought the beauty of truth that
is verily without a rival  flowered out in prayers of stone  visible
tokens of their yearning for heavenly reward  born of communion with
the divine in deep reflection  only to descend again to lower planes
to the seeking of the praise of man  in the decadent conventionality
of the later eastern Hindu empires  The story of the development of
architecture and sculpture in the island from the immaturity identified
with Pajajaran to the luxurious grandeur of the temples of Prambanan
the Mendoot and the Boro Budoor  hides a riddle no less strange
than that of the bursting forth of Arabic poetry  full blown in all
its subtleness of thought  exuberance of imagination  perfection
of language  The story of decline is written in the evolution of
decorative design  the significance of motives based on the observation
of the earth and her precious gifts  evaporates gradually in nicely
waving lines  elaborate scrolls  insipid fineries  The  kala  head
changes into the roots of a tree  figurative of the forest  the trunk
of Ganapati into its bole  at last the tree  roots  trunk  branches
foliage and all  with the sun rising over the forest  with mountains
touching the sky  with rivers flowing to the sea  into conventional
ornament  IslÄmic ideals were not conducive to a revival of artistic
conceptions fading into nothingness  neither was  to repeat that too
the painful contact with Christian civilisation  When the natives were
made to toil and moil for alien masters  their virtues and energies
blighted into the defects and failings of apathy  How could it be
otherwise where an inefficient  venal police and a slow  defective
administration of justice did  and does  not protect property against
depredation  where exertion beyond what is strictly necessary for
bare subsistence  meant  and means  not prosperity but increased
taxation  With all its pretensions to superiority and display of
ethical sentiment  the Dutch Government can scarcely be said to differ
much from Baron Sookmool  the personified East India Company of more
than three centuries ago  Holland s wards in her rich colonies may be
moulded into men  angels or devils  like the Triloka  the triple people
of the Hindus  according to the treatment meted out to them and the
education they receive  As far as Java is concerned  hoping in heaven s
mercy  they live in their old traditions  the light of the past and
the shadow of the present  What will the future bring in advance of
the day on which mankind shall be scattered abroad like moths  There
is no knowledge of it but with God and the secret lies behind the
Banaspati  21  in the hand of him of the budding lotus flower  the
Deliverer from Evil

CHAPTER III

THE DIÃ‹NG

   Where Silence undisturbed might watch alone
   So cold  so bright  so still

   PERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY   Queen Mab


Where five residencies  Samarang  Pekalongan  Banyumas  the Bagelen
and the Kadu  meet between two seas  the wonderland of the DiÃ«ng links
the eastern and western chain of volcanoes which are the vertebrae of
Java s spine  The DiÃ«ng plateau  the first part created  as tradition
goes  and destined to remain longest above water in the island s final
destruction and submersion  is nothing but a huge crater  Nature  in her
most mysterious mood  exercises here a charm of a peculiar character
well expressed by the name  according to the Javanese derivation from
adi aÃ«ng    i e   marvellously beautiful  22  The temples in this
region belong to the oldest and finest if by no means the largest of
Java  The discovery of a stone with a Venggi inscription has led to the
conjecture that the Hindu settlement to which we owe them  originated
from the Priangan  other indications point to immigration directly
from Southern India  However this may be  the dates ascertained  one
in an inscription reproduced by me in 1885 for further examination at
Batavia  leaving the stone in the place where I had found it  from 731
Saka  A D  809  on  witness to the lost civilisation of the DiÃ«ng having
reached its apogee at the time the Abbassides flourished in Baghdad and
the Omayyads in Cordova  How it rose  declined and fell  we do not know
For four centuries its memory lived only as a fantastic tale  the DiÃ«ng
remaining utterly deserted  a wilderness of mountain and forest
inhabited by devils and demons of the Khara and Dushana type

Resettled since about 1800  its villages increase in number and size
and its wild animals  big and small  disappear gradually  though the
tigers are still troublesome  evincing a growing disposition to vary
their accustomed fare with domestic kine and sheep  The sombre woods are
gone and efforts at reafforestation gave so far no perceptible results
The ground yields abundant crops of cabbage  onions and tobacco  in
which a lively trade is done with Chinese middlemen  who buy for the
merchants at Pekalongan  whence the product is shipped to larger centres
of trade  These middlemen congregate principally at Batoor  a prosperous
village  where travellers to the DiÃ«ng  arriving from that side  will
appreciate the hospitable disposition of the  wedono   the native chief
of the district  Many a one has been entertained under his roof  looked
down upon from the  palupooh   split bambu  walls by the Royal Family of
Great Britain and Kaiser Wilhelm in chromolithographic splendour  while
discussing a substantial lunch or arranging for sleeping accommodation
if too tired to push on  or desirous of visiting the Pakaraman  the
valley of death  at break of day when the uncanny manifestations of
that place of horror are strongest  Another source of income for
some of the Chinamen of Batoor and their henchmen of the DiÃ«ng is
opium smuggling  The geographical position  commanding access to five
administrative divisions of the island at once  lends itself admirably
to that lucrative business  And if the smugglers cater to a low vice
they can advance an excuse logically unanswerable by those in authority
who punish them when caught  they satisfy but a demand  in competition
with the Government that created it  introduced the drug and encourages
its use  artificially whetting a depraved appetite and demoralising the
children of the land for the sake of more revenue

Often though I went up to forget the cares of exacting duties in happy
holidays on the DiÃ«ng  trying the different approaches  the impressions
of my first ascent in October 1885 are freshest in my memory  Starting
from Wonosobo  I preferred to a more direct route the roundabout way via
Temanggoong  spending a day on the road between the twin volcanoes
Soombing and Sindoro  enjoying the views to right and left  every new
turn disclosing new wonders  mountain slopes basking in the warmth which
radiated triumphantly from a sky of dazzling brightness  valleys of
perfect loveliness losing their brilliant hues in the shades of evening
as if a curtain fell between the world left and the world entered  The
following morning early I rode from Temanggoong in a thick mist which
rolling away before the sun  uncovered a landscape more and more rugged
as I passed Parakan and Ngadirejo  but always more charming  a feast
to the eye  Near Ngadirejo the  chandis  Perot and Pringapoos claimed
my attention  Built for the worship of Siva  his  sakti  Doorga and
their eldest son  they offered a sad spectacle of decay  the former
crumbling away in the baneful embrace of a gigantic tamarind  one of
whose branches rose from the midst of the ruin straight up to heaven
overshadowing Ganesa  the conqueror of obstacles  in his meditations
the latter holding an image of Siva s  vahana  or  nandi   the bull
symbol of his creative power  still an object of veneration as the
boreh  indicated  the walls of the temple being decorated with splendid
bas reliefs representing a scene from Javanese history or mythology
analogous to the rape of the Sabine women  23  Farther on  surprise
succeeding surprise  lies Joomprit  another delicious spot  sanctified
by a holy grave  at the source of the Progo  The water  gushing forth
from the mouth of a cavern and trickling down its sides  is immediately
lost to sight in a declivity among the ferns  Curious monkeys herd
round  led by their brawny chief  imperious like Hanoman  born from the
wind  swinging through space  commanding the simian army of Sugriva
they constitute one of the few colonies of sacred apes which form a
living link with the Hindu epoch  that of Gaja Moongkoor on the DiÃ«ng
has ceased to exist

From Joomprit on  it was pretty steep climbing to a point where  at a
sudden turn  I beheld the lowlands  far beneath the clouds gathering
round me  fair plains resting under their hazy veil of midday repose
calm and undisturbed  Drinking deep of the invigorating mountain air  I
noticed the red cheeks of the women and girls who returned from market
in little groups  After descending to the tea plantations of Tambi
the clambering up began again  pretty hard for my pony  to which I
gave an occasional rest  looking back over hills and valleys as they
dissolved in soft melting tints  impressing the beholder with a sense
of eternal light in limitless space  Wonder akin to awe seized me
when  panorama like  a landscape of silent grandeur  quite different
from the graceful majesty of the rose gardens of Wonosobo and the
palm groves of Temanggoong  unfolded itself  I was on the DiÃ«ng plateau
Notwithstanding the late hour  my admiration of the scenery having made
my progress slow  I could not resist the temptation to dismount and
follow the trail which led me down to the source of the Serayu beside
the road  and pay my compliments to the shade of stalwart Bimo by way of
introduction to the regions resounding in its temples with his exploits
and those of other worthies sung in the  Brata Yuda   24  Nor indeed
only in its temples  this same delightful retreat commemorates Bimo s
prowess according to a legend which in its astonishing account of his
supernatural virility cannot be repeated  Enough to say that Arjuno
making him dig up the  toog  Bimo  on the advice of SamÄr  the wily
was the first  by determining the course of the Serayu  to direct the
water from the mountains of Central Java to the sea  therewith obtaining
the realm of Ngastino  And whoever takes a bath  alone and at night  in
the water springing from mother earth under the  pohoon chemeti   the
weeping willow of Bimo s fountain  will have no occasion for certain
elixirs largely advertised in daily and weekly papers  will retain
youthful vigour into hoariest age

It was dark when I arrived at the  pasangrahan   the Government
rest house  received first by a shaggy  plumetailed dog of the DiÃ«ng
variety  suspicious of strangers  Her name proved to be Sarama
suggesting classical associations not sustained  I am sorry to record
by her master  mine host  a Swiss  retired from service in the Dutch
colonial army and put in charge of the place  Speaking innumerable
languages and every one of them as if it were a  lingua franca
composed of all the others  he showed me my room  took orders for my
supper and made me comfortable  the broad  perpetual smile on his
honest face illumining our polyglot conversation  Alas  Wielandt is no
more  Indra  who knows men s hearts  has certainly assigned to this
diamond  more polished  presumably  in its celestial than in its former
terrestrial state  a worthy station among the jewels of the city of
bliss  Amaravati  A man of family instincts  good Wielandt left several
daughters  at the time of my visit of initiation extremely shy little
girls  and a son  then Sinjo Endrik  the obliging and attentive  ever
ready to act as a guide to and otherwise to assist his father s guests
on their excursions  now Tuan Endrik  his father s successor in the
pasangrahan   while one of his brothers in law keeps a small  private
hotel  opened to meet the increasing influx of sightseers and seekers
of health  The DiÃ«ng plateau  especially in the dry season  would be an
ideal site for a sanatorium  The sufferer from the debilitating heat on
the coast in the enervating conditions of a continuous struggle for the
next dollar or official preferment with fatter salary  may find there
rest and a cool climate  Going to the bath room before setting out early
on some expedition  I have often found miniature icicles pendent from
the  panchuran   the water conduit  and riding off  have often heard
in crossing a puddle  the thin coating of ice crackle under the hoofs
of my pony  Sometimes  at sunrise  the few remaining temples stand out
white  the whole plateau being covered with frost  which makes a strange
impression on one who but the day before yesterday sweltered in the
fiery furnace of  for instance  the Heerenstraat at Samarang

Waking up the morning after my first arrival  feeling cold  though
the scene my eyes met was not quite so severely wintry as that just
described  my dreams seemed to continue in reality  I beheld a tranquil
plain different in its bright serenity from everything I had so far seen
anywhere else  the Bimo temple rising to the left and the Arjuno group
to the right  sharply outlined against the hills and the sky  their
dark gray colour in wonderful harmony with the verdure of earth and
the blue expanse of heaven  One moment they appeared near in the clear
atmosphere as if I could seize them with my hand  and then again very
very far  never to be approached  A vapour  clinging to the slope of
the Pangonan in the direction of the Kawah Kidang  reminded me of the
tremendous cosmic energy entering into the composition of this soothing
stillness  this tonic for the sick and worried  with the certainty of
annihilation as final pledge of freedom  Once a lake of seething lava
the plateau lies enclosed by the tops of five mountains  the Prahu
Sroyo  Bismo  Nogosari and Jimat  2050 metres above the level of the
sea  the Pangonan and Pagar Kandang are old eruptive cones  formed
of the mud and sand thrown out  which accumulated at their bases and
raised the surrounding ground  The plateau in its narrower sense is
now a flat stretch of turf  in places  especially in the middle  a
morass  called the Rawa Baleh Kambang for its northern  and the Rawa
Glonggong for its southern part  Ruins have been found everywhere in
the plain and up the slopes of the hills  even up to the summit of the
Prahu  Here stand stone posts in a row  used by Arjuno  according to
the legend  to tether his elephants  while his cows  after grazing on
the Pangonan  were corralled for the night in the hollow of the Pagar
Kandang  lit   fence of the cattle pen   there  as in DiÃ«ng Kidool
layers of ashes among the slags and other debris  mark the situation
in the past of the burning grounds  which yield a steady harvest of
bronze and gold finger rings  bracelets  anklets and other objects of
personal adornment  Ancient aqueducts  walls  staircases  foundations of
secular buildings  clustered round the temples  remains of an important
religious centre  so various and rich that Junghuhn did not exaggerate
when calling them inexhaustible  suggest the existence  once upon a
time  in those mountain wilds  of a Javanese Benares  minus the Ganges
but plus a setting of unceasing volcanic activity  which demolished it
by a sudden  violent outbreak  Such suggestions need only the seconding
of one of the learned to be utterly ridiculed by his equally learned
brethren of an opposite school     We will let the matter rest at
that and simply enjoy the actual calm of a landscape evidently exposed
to destruction at the shortest notice  of nature recuperating from
outrageous debauch

Voices solemn and sweet summon to close communion with the power behind
those manifestations  the universal soul of things human and superhuman
infernal and divine  One look more at the strip of turf which clasps
the mysteries as a girdle embossed with gems  the Arjuno and Bimo
shrines  shining in the splendour of early morning   we shall return
to them after our stroll of orientation  In the  dessa  DiÃ«ng Wetan
close to the  pasangrahan   is  or rather was  the  watu rawit   a wall
constructed of big blocks of stone  two portions of which still exist
with a narrow staircase  hewn on a smaller scale  leading to the coping
The structure  largely drawn upon for building material  goes also by
the name of  benteng   fort of  Buddha  an appellation incompatible
with the SivaÃ¯te origin of DiÃ«ng architecture and a contradiction in
terms besides  considering the character of Gautama s teaching  but in
native parlance everything connected with the Hindu period is referred
to as belonging to the  jaman buda   while the expression  agama
buda  includes every pre Muhammadan ancestral religion  Via Patak
Banteng  Jojogan and Parikesit the  dessa  Simboongan may be reached
until recently the highest in Java  2078 metres   Founded in 1815 by
the grandfather of the present  lurah   or chief of the village  its
inhabitants  on whose stature and colour of skin the cool climate has
had a visible influence  are very prosperous  their principal occupation
being the preparation of a hair oil from the seeds of the  gandapura
 Hibiscus Abelmoschus    Simboongan lies on the west bank of Telaga
Chebong  one of the many lakes which add to the indescribable charm
of the DiÃ«ng  some possessing uncanny echoes  some being yellow and
sulphurous  some of ever changing hue  some of crystalline clearness
and stocked with goldfish  while the marshy shores are a favourite
haunt of  meliwis   a kind of duck much prized as food and becoming
correspondingly scarce  Proceeding to Sikunang we get beautiful views in
the direction of Batoor  hidden among its Chinese graves and orchards
as in an airy robe of white and green  along the mountain rills which
hasten impetuously to the valley of Banjarnegara  meeting in the
radiance of the sun s promise for union with the sea  down to the
ricefields of Temanggoong  resplendent at the feet of the high mountains
which keep guard over the Kadu  a paradise dominated by the sister
volcanoes Soombing and Sindoro  a joy to behold

Passing Sikunang and turning round the Gunoong Teroos  a spur of the
Pakuojo  we notice some trachyte steps  the head of a staircase made
for the convenience of pilgrims from what is now the residency Bagelen
to the city of temples  an ascent of five thousand feet  Over a long
distance  following the course of the river Lawang  that gigantic
roadway can be traced far below Telaga Menjer by stones left in holes
from which it was not easy to remove them for building purposes
Another of these  ondo buda  on the north side of the plateau  served
the pilgrims coming from what is now the residency Pekalongan  via Deles
and Sigamploong  and disappeared in the same manner  Descending  a smell
of sulphur announces a lion of the DiÃ«ng of a less innocent  in fact of
a decidedly satanic aspect  on this soil always the unsuspected turns
up  the remains of an ancient civilisation forcing themselves upon our
attention together with impressive reminders of the subterranean forces
which extinguished it  From a number of cavities on the slope of the
Pangonan  bare of vegetation  a picture of desolation  noxious vapours
rise and bubbles of mud are blown forth and burst with a rumbling noise
High above the rest works the Kawah Kidang  the deer kettle  spouting
and growling  throwing the hot liquid round with relish  and it is
advisable to keep her well to leeward on her days of gala  for she
changes frequently her aim and her mood  an index of Kala s disposition
when stirring the bowels of the earth  Being the pulse of the DiÃ«ng
so to speak  she is regularly excited to fiercer exertion by the rainy
season  differing also in this particular from the Chondro di Muka
her rival near the Pakaraman  with whom she has been confused even by
geographers of name  greatly to her disparagement since she commands
a considerably wider sphere of influence  not scrupling to encroach
upon the domain of her neighbours by moving about  Wherever one pokes
into the ground within her sphere of action  the steam rushes out and
seething puddles are formed  it is wary walking and the wise will take
warning from the foolhardy ContrÃ´leur whose curiosity prompted him a
step too far  sinking through the upper crust into the boiling mud
he had his legs so badly burnt that he died of the consequences and
was buried at Wonosobo instead of marrying his Resident s daughter at
Poorworejo

With its mofettes  solfataras  steam holes  mud geysers  sulphurous
lakes  its treacherously opening and closing chasms  25  last but
not least its notorious valley of death  26  the DiÃ«ng is the region
above all others in volcanic Java  of miracles that expound the
antagonism between fratricide life and death on our turbulent planet
which continuously prepares for or recovers from spasms of generative
destruction  One of these spasms  on a grander scale than usual in
the short span of human history  was the eruption of Krakatoa in
1883  which raised and submerged islands  shaking and altering the
Straits of Soonda  a resultant tidal wave razing the towns of Anyer
and Cheringin  The DiÃ«ng  some three hundred miles off  responded
faithfully  as might have been expected  the Kawah Kidang roaring and
splashing mud furiously  the wall of the crater lake Chebong cracking
in several places  so that part of its water  instead of flowing
through the old channel  now seeks its way through the fissures thus
created  remunerative tobacco fields being transformed into swamps  Such
disasters preach an eloquent sermon on the text  hewn in stone by the
builders of the temples here erected to Siva as Kala  the Overthrower
and  transmitted with the wisdom of ages by a later religion  happily
expressed by the German poet

    Was hilft es Menschen seyn  was liebe Blumen kÃ¼ssen
   Wann sie sind schÃ¶ne zwar  doch balde nichts seyn mÃ¼ssen   27

The news that a troop of strolling players had arrived  dispelled
however  ideas of that sort  unpalatable truth never proving successful
against the pleasurable excitement of the moment  They were going to
perform at the house of the reputedly wealthiest man of the plateau
and not the less highly considered by his neighbours because caught
redhanded  not once but repeatedly  in handling the forbidden  as I
heard afterwards  Living near one of the enclosures traditionally
associated with the pyres which were extinguished when the Hindu
priests deserted their altars  he gave the  ton  to the upper ten of
DiÃ«ng society   disporting like any other fly  unterrified by daily
manifestations of cosmic potency  Surrounded by his  ganadavatas
gods of the second rank  he welcomed me to the show  Mounted on sham
horses  the actors delighted their audience with a sham battle which
soon became a single combat between two valiant knights  encouraged by
masked clowns  funny yet exquisitely graceful in their movements  the
savoir vivre  of this people is perfectly matched with their elegance
of carriage and correctness of speech and innate propriety of demeanour
The comedians  stage properties did not amount to much and their
inventive genius shone the more brilliantly  a tiger  for a hunt of his
highness our common uncle 28  followed the joust  was improvised with
jute bagging and two pieces of wood  representing the jaws  snapping
ferociously  perhaps a compliment to the  orang wolanda  present  his
biped equivalent in native estimation  as already remarked  Or an
allusion may have been intended to local events  not longer than a week
before  Paman had tried to force Wielandt s stable  cooling his wrath
when baffled  on Sarama s pups

So much for my recollections of the histrionic exercises on the DiÃ«ng
and now about the temples  If Thomas Horsfield  in his narrative of the
tour he made through the island between 1802 and 1807  mentioned the
so called Buddha roads  it was Raffles who sent Cornelius  Lieutenant in
the Corps of Engineers  to survey the architectural remains on the DiÃ«ng
plateau proper  which the earlier traveller had not visited  According
to the official account of his mission  kept in the library of the
Museum of Antiquities at Leyden and still unpublished  he found whatever
was standing of some forty groups  covered with clay and volcanic ashes
up to nearly a fourth of the original height  Captain Baker  also
commissioned by Raffles  worked three weeks on the DiÃ«ng after his
examination of the ruins at Prambanan and the Boro Budoor  Junghuhn
whose observations date from 1838 to 1845  speaks of more than twenty
temples in a wilderness of marshy woods  The woods have disappeared  the
marshes hold their own and of his twenty temples only eight are left in
a recognisable shape  five of them belong to the Arjuno group  including
the so called house of SamÄr  the best preserved is the Wergodoro or
Bimo  the Andorowati and Gatot Kocho crumble away even faster than the
rest  It has already been remarked that the DiÃ«ng structures belong
to the oldest in the island  the  hanasima  inscription  transferred
to Batavia  furnishing a record of the DiÃ«ng civilisation which goes
back to 731 Saka  A D  809   They are interesting to the Indian
antiquary  wrote Fergusson   because they are Indian temples pure and
simple  and dedicated to Indian gods      what  they  tell us further
is  that if Java got her Buddhism from Gujerat and the mouths of the
Indus  she got her HinduÃ¯sm from Telingana and the mouths of the
Kistnah     Nor are  they  Dravidian in any sense of the word  They
are in storeys  but not with cells  nor any reminiscences of such
but they are Chalukyan   Later learning accepts this statement only
with cautious reserve  Whether Chalukyan or not  though  it is plain
even to the unlearned that  erected to Siva  the Mahadeva worshipped
principally in his character of Bhatara Guru  the divine teacher  to his
sakti  Doorga and their first born Ganesa  these temples  radiating the
all soul in the fierce glare of the midday sun  unfolding their secrets
in the mellow moonbeams of night  partake fully of their mysterious
surroundings  are integral portions of the ground they occupy  as
may be said of all ancient Javanese buildings  Men of great power of
imagination  deep reasoning sentiment  the builders of these marvels
working their thoughts up to the sky  rescued for us the essence of
the DiÃ«ng s past existence  Their apprehension of universal happiness
without beginning or end  sharpened by the desire to enjoy heaven on
earth  lent immortality to the greatness of a people every vestige of
whom would have disappeared but for their creative enthusiasm

Illustration  III   CHANDI  ARJUNO ON THE DIÃ‹NG PLATEAU

Archaeological Service through Charls and van Es

Prurient prudery  keen on the scent of the nasty  feels shocked at
the  lingas  and  yonis  lying round  unable in its fly blown purity
to grasp the divinity of eternal love in the poem of generation  the
union of the Deva and the Devi in causation and conception of life
The Philistine sees little more than rubbish  heaps of stone of no
earthly use except as havens of refuge when out shooting  meliwis
and overtaken by rain  In the Rawa Baleh Gambang we find five such
clustered together  the  chandis  Arjuno with the house of SamÄr
Srikandi  Ongko Wijoyo   Poontadewa  Trumo Kasumo or Sami Aji  and
Sembrada  Sepropo   the chief hero of the  Brata Yuda  being honoured
in the midst of family and friends  including his funny and faithful
servant  The  kala makara  29  ornament of the entrance to the  chandi
Arjuno tells its tale  so do the empty niches designed for free standing
statuettes dissolved into space  Like the  chandi  Srikandi it was once
surrounded by a wall and another point of resemblance is the small
rectangular building called the  chandi  SamÄr  probably destined for
secular purposes  of the Srikandi dependency  however  only the base
can be traced  The  chandi  Sembrada deviates somewhat in architectural
plan and detail  and the ground idea of the decoration can be studied
to best advantage in the  chandi  Poontadewa  finest of the group
exquisitely graceful on its high basement  Here again the  makara
ornament prevails  budding into leaves and flowers  chiselled with a
chaste appreciation of the esthetic principle of self control   In
der BeschrÃ¤nkung zeigt sich erst der Meister   Under the tapering
roofs  fallen or falling in  which give the inner chambers an air of
indescribable elegance  notwithstanding the cramped dimensions  images
of holiness stood on pedestals  the images have been removed  heaven
knows whither  and even the pedestals have fared badly at the hands
of sacrilegious robbers digging for hidden treasure  Trumo Kasumo
supposed to keep sentinel over his  chandi   in bas relief  north side
cannot but be scandalised at modern methods of research and modern
behaviour in general

The morass shows  in the dry season  the foundations of buildings
regularly arranged  lining streets which intersected at right angles
over a considerable part of the Rawa Baleh Gambang  Their disposition
has been advanced to support the theory that the population of the DiÃ«ng
lived in wooden houses  built on those substructures of stone  The
theory that the superstructures of stone have been carried away and the
submerged substructures left because not so easy to get at  is just as
plausible  perhaps a little more so  But whatever they were  temples and
priestly or private dwellings of wood or stone  the officiating clergy
their assistants and the inhabitants of the city ministering to their
fleshly needs  must have suffered a good deal from the dampness of the
soil  the plateau offering already in those early days a field of rich
promise for the experiments of hydraulic engineers  Among canals and
ditches of less importance  the Guwa Aswotomo  a  cloaca maxima  some
twelve centuries old  still relieves the plain of its superfluous water
According to the legend  for nothing in this locality goes without at
least one   according to the legend then  the subterraneous passage
was dug by Aswotomo on his expedition to the DiÃ«ng for the purpose
of smashing the Pandawas  and nearing Arjuno s residence he pushed
his way up to the surface  from distance to distance  spying how far
he had yet to continue his underground march  Descending into one of
the peep holes he made  in a season of extreme drought  I was able to
crawl on to the next  through mud and debris which blocked my further
progress and  unable to crawl out on a level fifteen or twenty feet
lower  the watercourse sloping deeper and deeper down  I had to return
to my point of ingress  The glory of this feat diminishes in the light
of my knowledge of the circumstance that the DiÃ«ng plateau harbours
no snakes  30  save the decorative  nagas  of temple architecture
and that a companion followed my movements above ground  had we been
provided with ropes  we might have carried our work of exploration
much further  but that must wait for another time  Of the rare plant
which grows nowhere but in Aswotomo s burrow and owes its growth to
his copious perspiration while at his task  a fern possessing rare
qualities  highly beneficial to him who pulls it out by the roots  I saw
or  rather  felt nothing in groping my way through mire and darkness
Taking its course in a direction inverse to the mole man s initial
tunnel boring  his Guwa begins at the Arjuno temples as an unpretentious
drain and runs  for about half a mile  slanting toward the source of the
river Dolok  where Junghuhn has set up two  lingas

Illustration  IV   CHANDI  BIMO OR WERGODORO ON THE DIÃ‹NG PLATEAU

Archaeological Service through Charls and van Es

The largest remaining and most beautiful temple on the DiÃ«ng is the
chandi  Wergodoro or Bimo  31  where the Pangonan rises out of
the Rawa Glonggong  Notwithstanding Fergusson s opinion  competent
critics  deriving their conclusions from the horizontal lines of the
roof storeys  maintain its Dravidian or Southern Indian instead of
Chalukyan character  32  The niches with busts  which impress one as
windows with people poking out their heads to see who is disturbing
their quiet  suggest an approach to ideas further developed in the
architecture of the plain of Prambanan  These curious persons look out
only at the back and at the sides  the niches of the roof in front  over
the projecting porch with  kala makara  ornament  are all empty  With
its entrance facing east  in contradistinction to those of the other
temples on the plateau  which face west  the  chandi  Bimo possesses
also notable peculiarities in the details of its sculpture  the double
lotus of the cornice  lotus buds and diminutive bo trees of uncommon
shapes  etc   while the upward tapering structural design displays a
tendency to the slightly curved lines so dearly loved by Greek builders
of the best period and adapted by the masters of early Gothic  The
larger  lower niches have been despoiled  architraves and mouldings
festooned with foliage  flowers and seed pods  divide the open spaces
round about in a tasteful  sober manner  exciting without fatiguing
the eye  From the fact that the decoration has not been completed  it
is inferred that the sculptors were interrupted like their comrades at
work on other monuments of Central Java  overwhelmed perhaps by the
catastrophe of volcanic or martial nature  which depopulated the DiÃ«ng
and coincided with the decline of the ancient empire of Hindu Mataram
The miraculous voice heard in the  chandi  Bimo at dead of night  is
silent on this point  All temples have their  shetans   their bad
rarely good spirits  but the  genius loci  of the Bimo excels the whole
Arjuno crowd of them in efficacy and unfailing attention to the business
of the seekers of advice  who arrive from far and wide to consult the
oracle  Entering after dusk the gate of the Dread One  Kala  one with
Rudra  the Roarer  the Kawa Kidang  near by  they have but to wait in
prayer at the altar of the wondrous fane  A strange whisper  mounting
like the odour of  melati  and  kenanga   tells them how to avoid the
grim giant Danger if  on leaving  they are firmly determined to pursue
the road of Good Desert

The  chandis  Gatot Kocho and Andorowati  falling into hopeless ruin
will soon be remembered only by their location  like the  chandi
Parikesit  and it is a pity to think of those which left no trace at
all  whose very names are forgotten  The state of affairs on the DiÃ«ng
plateau  said Captain  now Major T  van Erp  33  commissioned for the
restoration of the Boro Budoor  leaves everything to be desired
Villages came into existence and expanded  The inhabitants need stone
substructures in building their houses and it is a matter of course that
they use temple stones for that purpose  these are here much smaller
than those of the monuments in the valley of the Progo and the plain of
Prambanan  easily carried off and exactly of the right size     This is
the case of the spoliation of the temples on the DiÃ«ng in a nutshell
But it should be added that the natives are not the only offenders  So
much  indeed  is implied in Major van Erp s anecdote of a tourist who
examining the statuary adorning the grounds of the  pasangrahan   a
remarkable collection formed from miscellaneous loot  was invited to
make his choice  the selected plunder to be delivered at Wonosobo in
consideration of five guilders  a little over eight shillings   Many
others had the same experience  numberless statues and stones carved
into ornament have been appropriated by official and unofficial visitors
to enrich museums and private collections  The appointment of Wielandt
Sr   later of Wielandt Jr  as keeper of the  pasangrahan  and of the
antiquities in a region of archaeological interest equal to Pompeii and
Herculaneum  without any funds whatsoever at their disposal  was only
an incident in the continuous farce performed by the Dutch East Indian
Government in all its relations to monumental Java up to the date of its
laborious confinement of the Archaeological Commission  and after  as I
shall have abundant occasion to show  a farce with consequences sad to
contemplate  This applies to antiquities of every description  I turn to
my diary  In different places  when digging  layers of ashes are found
with charred human bones imbedded  and often trinkets  The natives
however  keep their treasure troves secret for fear of the Government
which has decreed  and rightly  reserving its rights  that they may
not sell without asking for and obtaining permission  but appropriates
everything it hears of  at ridiculously low prices  a good deal is
therefore sold and bought privately  notwithstanding the prohibition
even by officials  a systematic search never having been attempted  none
the less fine trifles are unearthed and not always trifles either  last
night  in the  pasangrahan   some rings were shown to me  the owner
acting very mysteriously  produced at last a statuette from under his
baju   about six inches of solid gold  beautifully wrought  its mate
equal in height  material and workmanship  he had been forced to sell
according to his story  for seventy guilders  less than  6   he wanted
more to part with this one and it is certainly worth many and many times
that sum  a change in the usual sordid Government practice would result
in remarkable discoveries  recently  as Dr  L  told me  an inscribed
stone was laid bare  when trying to have a look at it the same day  his
informant told him that it had already been spirited away to prevent
susah   trouble   not much is necessary to be sentenced to  krakal
hard labour in the chain gang  at Wonosobo

It is true the Government sent some one to the DiÃ«ng  about fifty years
ago  to photograph the temples as they then existed and  fortunately
the operator chosen was I  van Kinsbergen who  having made his dÃ©but in
Java as a member of an opera troupe  developed a rare artistic sense
in portraying the deteriorating outlines of the ancient fanes of the
island  But there the matter rested until the complaints became too loud
and in 1910 hopes were held out that steps would be taken to clear the
ruins of parasitic vegetation  to drain the plateau by repairing the
trenches and conduits still in working order since the Hindu period
incidentally to consider the possibility of restoring the sanctuaries
not yet tumbled down  Names I heard in connection with this charge
make me tremble  writes a correspondent from Batavia  for a repetition
of the vandalism committed in the plain of Prambanan  particularly
the criminal assaults on the  chandi  Plahosan and the  chandi  Sewu
where a Government commissioner tried to arrest further decay on the
homoeopathic principle   similia similibus curantur   Government
solicitude for conservation proves often more destructive than simple
neglect and  to take an illustration from the DiÃ«ng itself  others will
be culled in the course of my observations  from a plentiful supply of
official  bÃªtises  and  bÃ©vues   if not worse  in other localities   no
sooner was general attention drawn to the enigmatic sign  described by
Junghuhn and copied in his standard work from a rock between the lakes
Warna and Pengilon  than it began to fade  Still quite clear in 1885
and up to 1895  despite its having been exposed to wind and weather
during ten centuries  as surmised   it became fainter and fainter after
that year  the process of a gradual loss of colour being duly noted at
subsequent visits  until in 1902 I found it hardly distinguishable  To
make up for the injury  a ContrÃ´leur discovered  in 1889  supplementary
tokens  not black but red  on the same Batu Tulis  or Watu KetÃ¨q as
the natives rather call it   monkey stone   because they recognise in
the figure recorded by Junghuhn  a likeness to the animal referred to
The smaller red letters  or whatever they were intended for  steadily
increasing in number  appearing in places where I had never noticed
anything before  I could not help suspecting the little shepherds who
look so innocent and shy and hardly venture an answer when spoken to  of
knowing more about this miraculous growth of a hieroglyphic inscription
than their artlessness implied  For all their stolid mien  the natives
are exceedingly fond of a joke and what greater sport can be imagined
than to get the wise men of Batavia and of European centres of erudition
by the ears  inciting them to raise always more learned dust in their
efforts to decipher the undecipherable characters of an impossible
language  each being cocksure of the infallibility of his individual
interpretation  If  however  we have not to do with Kromo or Wongso his
mark  the ghost of the Batu Tulis must be held responsible for  among
the incorporeal inhabitants of the many caves in this neighbourhood
the dweller beneath the monkey stone is of greatest occult potency and
the good people who come from the adjoining lowland districts  even from
Surakarta and Jogjakarta  to hear and translate the voices of the DiÃ«ng
repair hither  after partaking of good advice in the Bimo temple  to
sembah   make their salutation  before the entrance and ask  slamat
blessing and success  on their foreshadowed undertakings  Nocturnal
devotions inside the cave of the Watu KetÃ¨q on a lucky  right lucky
carefully calculated night  means untold wealth  and whoever dares to
brave the resident sprite of darkness with that desire in his heart  as
very few do  and still remains a poor devil  has doubtless skipped a
word of power in muttering his incantations or disregarded some other
essential observance

To the lover of mountain scenery it is far more profitable to wait
for dawn near the triangulation pillar and point of junction of four
residencies  Samarang  Pekalongan  Banyumas and the Bagelen  with a
fifth  the Kadu  only a few paces off  when the Eye of Day rises to
divide the waters behind the mountains and the rack of clouds  and
to the north and the south of the island  the sea begins to glimmer
in the azure and orange tints sent before to meet the melting gray of
vanquished darkness  Following its course in all compassing space  the
soul enters into silent communion with nature  the divine creation of
the supremely divine which teaches feeble men how to worship  Such
moments bring a wholesome chastening of the flesh and as we descend
goaded by the fierce darts of the conqueror overhead who makes the
earth wrap herself in her vapoury robe of protection  veiling the
grand vision   as we descend where the runnels descend that feed the
Serayu and the Tulis winding its way to the Kawah Kidang  we find the
plain with the  chandis  one immense temple of adoration  The Vedic
subtle body yearns to enter the sheath of prayer  to be moulded by
its creator into the form fit for union with the spirit of the world
respiration becomes aspiration to the beatitude of manifest truth  of
final rest in extinction of sin and shame and sorrow  So pass the hours
in purification  in desire of a spark of the thought which breathes
life into mortification of self  Then  at the passing of the light
with the last flush from the West  in awe inspiring stillness  the
quivering stars lift their heads to watch the holy city of the dead  in
clear toned stillness  the night wind moaning  the Rawa lamenting the
lost civilisation of a lost religion whose symbols remain but are not
understood  a mourning for humanity labouring in vain  The DiÃ«ng has
been repopulated with a race between whose fanciful ideals  rooted in
a forgotten past  and the rapacity of foreign rulers no lasting accord
seems possible  Is it ordained that they  the thralls and the masters
shall continue in their present relations  Or will they disappear in
their turn and  to quote Junghuhn  this mountain region revert to its
free  natural state  Perhaps in the hour of upheaval native seers
prophesy  when safety shall be found by none except to whom the Just
Reckoner grants it  And mingling in one measure  which comprises the
jaman buda   the time of bondage and the future  their dim notions
of Mahadeva  the Beneficent Destroyer  and their conception of the
dispensation of the Book  the leaders of religious exercise in the
villages abide by their advice of submission until the true believers
win the day  a day of glory for IslÄm  sure to arrive in the circular
course of existence  which is nothing but Sansara  in attainment of
Moslim brotherhood  which is nothing but Brahma Vihara  the sublime
condition of love  Meanwhile  hearing is to be practised  haply it
will lead to the comprehension of a lesson inculcated by each of the
three creeds amalgamated in the Javanese mind and best expressed in the
form borrowed from a fourth  The thing that hath been  is that which
shall be  and that which is done  is that which shall be done   or  in
the version of the greatest poet of our own age   CiÃ² che fu  torna e

CHAPTER IV

PRAMBANAN

    Queen Gertrude

                all that lives must die
   Passing through nature to eternity

   WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE   Hamlet  Prince of Denmark   I   ii


The vast plain of Prambanan  which extends southward from the foot of
the Merapi  one of Java s most active volcanoes  35  is  or rather was
studded with SivaÃ¯te and Buddhist temples  Called  in the later days
of ignorance regarding their signification  after some outstanding
feature  Sewu  Loomboong  Asu   after gods  demi gods and heroes of
romance  as on the DiÃ«ng   after the villages near which they were found
Kalasan or Kali Bening   or after their general position  a good many
might share the appellation Prambanan  In speaking of  the  Prambanan
temples  however  the group is meant which lies beside the main road
between Surakarta and Jogjakarta  where the two residencies meet  but
still within the boundaries of the latter  Excepting the Boro Budoor
and Mendoot  it comprises the finest and most famous monuments of
Central Java  which from olden times have been held in great veneration
by the population  even in their neglected condition  when reduced to
little more than heaps of overgrown debris  lairs of wild animals  Freed
from their luxurious vegetation and excavated  architectural remains
of the first order came to light with sculptured ornament nowhere
else surpassed in richness of detail and correctness of execution
Surrounded by ruins of a mainly Buddhist character  these buildings
were consecrated to the Hindu Trinity with Siva leading the Trimoorti
as Bhatara Guru  Master and Teacher of the World  A date recently
discovered  886 Saka  A D  964   or  according to another reading
996 Saka  A D  1074   points to the period when SivaÃ¯sm in Java had
already become strongly impregnated with Buddhism  a circumstance
fully borne out by the external decoration

Illustration  IV  EAST FRONT OF THE SIVA  LORO JONGGRANG  TEMPLE OF THE
PRAMBANAN GROUP IN 1895

Cephas Sr

Among the natives  the Prambanan ruins go by the name of  chandi
Loro 36  Jonggrang because of the legend connected with their origin
Once upon a time Prambanan was ruled by a giant king  Ratu Boko
possessed of an only daughter  Princess Jonggrang  and an adopted son
Raden Gupolo  whose father had been killed by command of the King of
Pengging  Having sworn revenge  Raden Gupolo feigned love for the
beautiful daughter of that monarch and asked Ratu Boko to assist him
in making her his wife  Ambassadors were despatched with instructions
to negotiate the marriage  His Majesty of Pengging received them in
a friendly manner and entertained them at his Court but  not wanting
Raden Gupolo for a son in law  he sent secret agents in all directions
to seek and bind to his service a hero with power to resist and subdue
the giants  Ratu Boko s subjects  of whom he was in mortal fear  One
of those emissaries  searching the slopes of the Soombing  met with
the recluse Damar Moyo of the children of Sumendi Petoong  the chief
of the  legÃ¨n  drawers  37  Damar Moyo s wife had blessed him with two
sons  Bondowoso  a tall and strong fellow  and Bambang Kandilaras
less muscular but more favoured in outward appearance and of a gentler
disposition  whom he recommended as just the man needed for the rescue
of the Princess of Pengging and ready for the task  provided her royal
father would consent  in consideration of the defeat of the giants
to give his daughter to the young man with half his kingdom as dowry
and the other half to follow after his death  which conditions prove
that even in those remote days the saintly did not despise worldly
advantage  The King of Pengging consented and Bambang Kandilaras marched
against Prambanan  but no weapon could harm Ratu Boko  who roared so
dreadfully that the sound and his breath combined were enough to knock
any human foe down at a distance too far to distinguish a man from
a woman or a giant from a  waringin  tree  Bambang Kandilaras fled
reporting at Damar Moyo s cave  and was commanded to try once more with
the assistance of his brother Bondowoso  They accomplished nothing
Bambang Kandilaras ran away even before the battle commenced  to hide
himself in a ravine where the troops of Prambanan could not follow
him  and Bondowoso  blown off his legs by a puff from Ratu Boko s
formidable lungs  sought safety in precipitate retreat to the mountain
Soombing  Then Damar Moyo taught him a magical word which  pronounced
twice  would make him big and heavy as an elephant  and give him the
strength of a thousand of those animals  Thus armed  Bondowoso returned
to Prambanan  where he killed half of Ratu Boko s warriors in their
sleep  while the other half  waking up  concentrated backward  with
the enemy in hot pursuit  to tell their king what had happened  Nobody
shall stir  said he  I myself alone will settle this little business
Meeting Bondowoso near the village Tangkisan  38  he began to roar as
loud and fume as hard as he could but  to his astonishment  his breath
lacked the accustomed power and so he had to fight for his life hand to
hand  It was a terrible fight  houses and gardens were trampled down
forests rooted up and mountains kicked over  while the perspiration
dripping from the bodies of the enraged combatants formed a large pool
the Telaga Powiniyan  39  To end the struggle  Bondowoso  in a supreme
effort  seized Ratu Boko round the middle and threw him into that pool
where he sank and  drowning  made the earth tremble with a last roar
of anger and distress  40  Raden Gupolo  hearing the noise  hastened
to his assistance with a few drops of the water of life in a cup  an
elixir prepared by Mboq Loro Jonggrang   only a few drops  but enough to
resuscitate the dead giant king if put to his lips  Bambang Kandilaras
however  drew his bow and  from the place where he had watched the
fight  shot the cup out of the hand of Raden Gupolo  who thereupon
attacked Bondowoso  Bambang Kandilaras let more arrows fly at the
giant warriors of Prambanan  who now rushed up to avenge their king s
death  In the general  mÃªlÃ©e  Bondowoso killed also Raden Gupolo and cut
off his head  which he threw away in an easterly direction  changing it
into a mountain  the Gunoong Gampeng  but his brains and heart he threw
away in a southwesterly direction  changing them into another mountain
the Gunoong Woongkal  Thereupon he defeated the remaining half of the
army of Prambanan and repaired to Pengging  claiming the reward for
his brother  The king of that country  glad to be rid of the giants
was as good as his word  wedded his beautiful daughter to Bambang
Kandilaras and appointed Bondowoso his viceroy in Prambanan  with the
rank and title of  bupati   Taking up his abode in the palace of the
late Raden Gupolo  Bondowoso happened to see Mboq Loro Jonggrang  who
continued living in the  kraton  of Ratu Boko  and fell in love with
her  He asked her hand in marriage and she  abhorring the man who had
killed her father  and one so unprepossessing in countenance too  but
afraid to provoke his displeasure by a blank refusal  answered that she
was willing to become his wife on condition of his providing a suitable
sasrahan  or wedding present  nothing more nor less than six deep wells
in six buildings  the like of which no mortal eye had ever seen  with
a thousand statues of the former kings of Prambanan and their divine
ancestors  the gods in heaven  all to be dug and built and carved in one
night  Bondowoso called in the help of his father  the recluse Damar
Moyo  of the King of Pengging and of his brother Bambang Kandilaras  all
three of whom responded  going to Prambanan and uniting in prayer on the
day before the night agreed upon by the spirits of the lower regions
who had been commandeered for the task by the saint of the mountain
Soombing  The evening fell and as soon as darkness enveloped the earth
a weird sound was heard of invisible hands busy laying foundations
erecting walls and sculpturing statuary  By half past three o clock the
six wells were dug  the six buildings completed and nine hundred and
ninety nine statues standing in their places  But Mboq Loro Jonggrang
roused from her slumbers by the hammering and chiselling  and suspecting
what was going on  ordered her handmaidens out to stamp the  padi  41
and to strew the ground  where the noise was loudest  with flowers and
to sprinkle perfume  The spirits of the lower regions cannot bear the
odour of flowers and perfumes  as everybody knows  so they had to desist
and deserted their almost finished work in precipitate flight  to the
consternation of Bondowoso  who pronounced this curse  Since the girls
of Prambanan take pleasure in fooling a faithful suitor  may the gods
grant that they shall have to wait long before they become brides  42
Having said this  yet hoping against hope  he called on his lady  who
asked tauntingly whether the honour of his visit meant the announcement
that the task imposed upon him by way of testing his love  had been
completed  This filled the measure and he answered  No  it is not and
you shall complete it yourself  The threat was immediately realised
Loro Jonggrang changed into a statue of stone  the thousandth  which
terminated the labour of the spirits and is still to be seen in a niche
on the north side of the principal edifice

The reader will recognise in this legend the hoary eastern material of
many others current also in western lands  It pervades the legendary
lore connected with the plain of Prambanan in widest sense  and one of
its many variations  to be recorded farther on  applies specially to the
Buddhist  chandi  Sewu or  thousand temples   only a little distance
from the Loro Jonggrang group  43  in fact  originally adapted to
account for the many ruins scattered over a vast area in that region
it has taken separate forms to meet the requirements of separate
localities  Apart from tradition  we owe the oldest extant description
of the Prambanan antiquities to the East India Company s servant Lons at
Samarang  who wrote in 1733  The Governor General van Imhoff referred to
them in 1746 and Raffles  his successor during the British Interregnum
not satisfied with writing and talking alone  commissioned Cornelius
with Wardenaar to survey them and make plans for reconstruction  After
1816 things returned to the accustomed neglect  A short stay in the
plain of Prambanan  says an authority already quoted  44  is sufficient
to note that thousands of valuable hewn and sculptured stones have been
and still are used for all sorts of purposes      from time immemorial
great quantities of stone have been  and still are  taken from
Prambanan by his Highness the Sooltan of Jogjakarta  generally once or
twice a year      this happens  if I am well informed  in compliance
with a written demand  fiated by the local authorities  The foundation
in 1885  of the Archaeological Society of Jogjakarta  which undertook
the excavation of the parts of the Loro Jonggrang group covered with
debris and vegetation  and the clearing of the whole  did little to
ameliorate the situation with respect to the carrying away from the
Prambanan temples  speaking collectively  of stones for the building of
houses  factories  etc   and of ornament for the decoration of private
grounds and gardens  Though bills were posted all over the ruins
including Doorga s  alias Loro Jonggrang s sanctum  prohibiting  by
order of that Society  the salving of gods and goddesses with  boreh
and the defacing of the walls with inscriptions  its members themselves
dragged statues away to fill a so called museum of their contrivance
at the provincial capital  dislocating things of beauty  ranging the
disjecta membra  on scaffoldings in a shed as crockery on the shelves
of a cupboard  The monuments of Prambanan being primarily mausolea
their first concern was to dig for the  saptaratna   the seven treasures
buried with the ashes of the dead under the images of the deities
hallowing those perishable remains  The plunder consisted in urns
containing  besides the ashes  coins  rubies and other precious stones
pieces of gold  and silver leaf with cut figures  serpents  tortoises
flowers   strips of gold foil inscribed with ancient characters
fragments of copper and glass  etc  The mortuary pits easiest to rifle
had already been emptied before the semi official spoilers turned their
attention to them  This chapter is not the most glorious in the history
of the Archaeological Society of Jogjakarta which  on the other hand
started a work too long neglected by the Dutch Government  even after
Raffles  vigorous initial effort  Incidentally it promoted the schemes
of the superficial yet very ambitious  pushing to the front on the
strength of what should have been put to the credit of more capable but
to their detriment  more modest labourers in the archaeological field
It is not always the most deserving horses that get the oats  says a
Dutch proverb

IN 1901

Cephas Sr

The SivaÃ¯te character of the temples of Prambanan would be sufficiently
indicated  if there were no other proofs  by the sepulchral cavities
they inclose and which define them as the monuments of a graveyard
consecrated to the memory of the great and mighty of Hindu Mataram  who
worshipped Siva as Mahadeva  the Supreme God  Paramesvara  the Maker
the Maintainer  the Marrer to make again  Sepulchral pits or wells are
indeed  the SivaÃ¯te hall mark in the architecture of Java and here  at
Prambanan  we find  in so far as preserved  the finest of the edifices
raised to encompass and revet such pits  temple tombs built for the
glorification of the Creator in creative consciousness  highest boon
granted to humanity  a glimmering of his All Soul which  leaving
the dust to return to dust  aspires to union with the Uncreated  A
central group of eight shrines  once surrounded by numberless smaller
ones  witnesses  in soberness of well balanced outline  in precision of
detail  to the exquisite art of those Hindu Javanese master builders
who  like the architects of our old cathedrals  were unconcerned as to
the opinion of man  but had the adoration of the godhead in mind and
made the whole world partake of the divine blessing which quickened
heart and hand  whether then descending from Siva s nature as the
essence of the Trimoorti  or from the sublime truth symbolised in the
Christian Holy Trinity  The marvels of design and execution still
standing at Prambanan in their dilapidated state  on a terrace excavated
in 1893 4  were arranged  with the smaller ones now altogether gone  in
a square whose sides faced the cardinal points  The material used in
their construction was a kind of trachyte which  originally yellowish
and hard to chisel into shape  has assumed a dark gray colour and by the
richness of the sculptured ornament gives an impression as if easily
moulded like wax  The three western temples  of which the one in the
middle  consecrated to Siva or  according to the natives  the  chandi
Loro Jonggrang proper  is the largest  correspond each with a smaller
structure to the east  still smaller  chandis  bound the space between
the two rows to the north and south  The buildings dedicated to the
Trimoorti  set squarely with a square projection on each side  rest on
basements of the same polygonous conformation  so much in favour with
the architects of that period  the inner rooms are on an elevated level
because of their position over the vault like compartments saved out in
the substructures  and can be reached by staircases  once provided with
porches  leading to the storeyed galleries  Vestiges of 157 diminutive
chandis  outside the rampart which encircled the central group
testify to the former existence of many and many more  shut in by a
second and a third demolished wall  A closer inspection of the ruins
revealing beauties not yet departed  leads to an apprehension of what
has been irrevocably lost  These temples of the three gods who are but
one  always reminded me in their pathetic desolation of the  capellas
imparfeitas  of Santa Maria da Victoria  what is incomplete  however
unfinished at Batalha  has run to decay at Prambanan  there the budding
promise and arrested blossoming of an artistic idea  here the scattered
petals of the full blown flower rudely broken off its stem

Siva is the keynote of the Prambanan group  Siva  the Jagad  the Bhatara
Guru  according to his prevalent title in the island  In the temple
which bears his name  he appeared as the leader in the exterior chapel
looking south  his wife  Doorga  looks north  their first born  Ganesa
looks west  The latter  sitting on his lotus cushion  is represented as
the Ekadanta  the elephant deprived of one of his tusks when fighting
Parashu Rama  a third eye in his forehead betokens his keenness of
sight  he wears in his crown the emblematic skull and crescent of his
father  one of his left hands brandishes his father s battle axe  one
of his right hands holds the string of beads suggesting prayer  his
father s  upawita   the hooded snake  is strung round his left shoulder
and breast  Doorga  his mother  born from the flames which proceeded
from the mouths of the gods  stands on the steer she killed when the
terrific animal had stormed Indra s heaven and humiliated the immortals
her eight hands 45  wield the weapons and other gifts bestowed upon her
by the deities at their delivery  Vishnu s discus  Surya s arrows  etc
etc   while her nethermost right hand seizes the enemy s tail and her
nethermost left hand the shaggy locks of the demon Maheso  who tries to
escape with the monster s life  This magnificent piece of sculpture
highly dramatic and yet within the limits of plastic art  the unknown
maker having instinctively obeyed the rules formulated in Lessing s
Laokoon   some thousand years after his labours were ended  is the
petrified Lady Jonggrang  victim of Bondowoso s revengeful love  It
does not matter to the native that Siva has always claimed her as his
consort  if not under the name of Doorga then under that of Kali or Uma
ever since she  Parvati  the Mother of Nature  divided herself into
three female entities to marry her three sons  who are none but he who
sits enthroned as Mahadeva in the inner chamber  looking east  with his
less placid personifications  the  dvarapalas   doorkeepers  Nandisvara
and Mahakala  the wielders of trident and cudgel  guarding the entrance
supported by demi gods and heroes  The colossal statue of their heavenly
lord  broken into pieces by the falling roof  has been restored and
replaced on its  padmasana   lotus cushion   In this shape the god
wears the  makuta   crown  with skull and crescent  has a third eye in
his forehead and a cobra strung round his left shoulder and breast
his body  decked with a tiger s skin  rests against the  prabha   his
aureole  one of his left hands holds his fly flap  one of his right
hands his string of beads  of his trident only the stick remains

Siva  the one of dreadful charm  is everywhere  either personified or
in his attributes  he dominates the external decoration of the Vishnu
and the Brahma temples too  in the latter case as  guru   even to
the exclusion of all other gods  the middle  chandi  of the eastern
row  facing his principal shrine  has his  vahana   the bull  the one
to the north his smaller image  while in the third  to the south
wholly demolished  no statuary can be traced  The inner chambers of
the subordinate buildings show more plainly than that of Siva  which
is adorned with flowery ornament  that the SivaÃ¯te style concentrated
ornamentation rather on the exterior than on the interior  The four
statues of Brahma  the master of the four crowned countenances  who
lies shattered among the debris of his temple  and the four statues
of Vishnu in his  a large one with  makuta    prabha    chakra  and
sanka   and three smaller ones  representing him in his fourth and
fifth  avatar  and in his married state with his  sakti  Lakshmi in
miniature on his left arm   are chastely conceived in the chaste
surroundings of their chapels  In addition to the sorely damaged
Ramayana  reliefs  presently to be spoken of  they dwell  however
simple the interior arrangement of their cells may be  among richly
carved images of their peers and followers stationed outside  Vishnu
among his own less famous  avatars  and supposed Bodhisatvas between
female figures  Brahma  as already remarked  among personifications of
the ubiquitous Siva in his quality of teacher  accompanied by bearded
men of holiness  Siva s  nandi   a beautifully moulded humped bull
emblem of divine virility  watches his master s abode  attentive to
the word of command   watches day and night as symbolised by Surya
the beaming sun  carrying the flowers of life when rising behind her
seven horses  and by Chandra  the three eyed moon  drawn by ten horses
waving a banner and also presenting a flower  but one wrapped in a
cloud  The  chandis  of the eastern row  fortunately not yet despoiled
of these striking specimens of SivaÃ¯te sculpture  the statue of Siva
opposite the Vishnu temple and enough to enable one to recognise that
they too had once a band of ornament in high and low relief  emphasise
even in the ruinous condition of their substructures  polygonous like
those of the larger temples but on square foundations  the mystery
attaching to the fascination exercised by the main building they
supplement  and whose decoration  strictly SivaÃ¯tic on the inside
while partaking of the Buddhistic on the outside  has racked many
brains for an explanation  The bo trees and prayer bells  profusely
employed in its external embellishment  together with figures agreeable
to the Bodhisatva theory  have led some to advance the opinion that
it is a purely Buddhist creation  though perhaps tinged with SivaÃ¯te
notions  They were met with the objection that there is no sign of
a dagob as distinguishing Buddhist feature  that the riddle of the
resemblance between the statuary on the outside of the Siva temple
and the conventional representation of Bodhisatvas  could find its
solution in the canonisation or deification of kings and famous chiefs
a practice as old as ancestor worship  which held its own in Java from
pre Hindu days up to our own  However this may be  if the Prambanan
temples  and especially the one particularly dedicated to the great
god of the Trimoorti  preached orthodox SivaÃ¯sm to the elect of its
innermost conviction  while tainted externally with the heresy of the
deniers of the existence of gods  the indubitably Buddhist Mendoot
reverses the process  This and the syncretism discernible in nearly all
the  chandis  of Java  shows the religious tolerance of the Javanese
in the Hindu period  And religiously tolerant they are still as true
believers in the true faith of IslÄm  the fanaticism one occasionally
hears of  roots rather in discontent from economic causes than in
bigotry or over zealous devotion to a creed which declares rebellion for
conscience  sake against a firmly established rule that recognises it
to be unlawful

The demi gods and heroes with their followers on the outside of the
Siva temple  occupy  counting from the base upward  the third tier
of ornamentation  also the highest in the roofless condition of the
building  the few niches left above are empty  Beneath  the story of
Rama  an incarnation of Vishnu  is told in bas reliefs which belong to
the very best Hindu sculpture discovered in Java or anywhere else  The
division of the casements is effected by bo trees  sitting lions and
standing or dancing women in haut relief  especially the last being of
exquisite workmanship  In endlessly varying attitudes  embracing one
another or tripping the light fantastic toe  retreating and advancing
their measured steps being regulated by the musicians on interspersed
panels  they represent the  apsaras   nymphs of heaven  adorning the
house of prayer to acquaint mortal man with the joys in store for
the doer of good  The human birds and other mythical animals under
the bo trees  the prayer bells and flowers in the garlanded foliage
enhance the charm of this ingenious decoration  the splendidly limbed
virgins disporting themselves in a frame of imposing magnificence  their
graceful movements being worthily seconded by the sumptuous setting
Nor does this wealth of detail  this marvellous display of artistic
power  of skill perfected by imaginative thought  divert the attention
from the divine idea embodied in Siva or from the introduction to its
understanding provided by the  Ramayana   initiating the beholder s
intelligence by degrees  All is so well balanced that the lower guides
to the higher in whetting comprehensive desire  First  on reaching the
terrace  starting from the low level of vulgar interest  curiosity and
sympathy are awakened by the epic which shared popular favour with the
Brata Yuda   It is not known who enriched the literature of Java with
a version of the  Ramayana  adapted to Javanese requirements  as in the
case of the  Mahabharata  he was probably one of the poets living at the
cultured courts of the eastern part of the island  Whatever his name
he made a hit with his tale of the god who descended from heaven  bent
on flirting with the daughters of men  and won a wife  the tenderly
loving Sita  by drawing Dhanusha  the mighty bow of Siva  His success
may be appraised by the circumstance that scenes taken from his poem
were deemed suitable to embellish the tombs of sovereign rulers  Can it
be called an improvement after more than a thousand years of progressive
western civilisation that we  to honour the memory of our dead
make shift with inflated epitaphs advertising virtues in life often
conspicuous by an absence which the maudlin angels of our cemeteries
rather than shedding undeserved  vicarious tears  perpetually seem to
bemoan on their own account

The adventures of Vishnu in his Rama guise are told from the moment
of Dasharatha  King of Ayodhya  invoking his aid to make the royal
consorts partake of the blessing of motherhood  Vishnu  resting on the
seven headed serpent of the sea  Sesha or Ananta  the one without end
dispenses a potion which makes Kantalya  who drinks half of it  conceive
Rama  Kaykaji  who drinks a fourth part of it  Bharata  and the third
spouse  who drinks the rest  the twins Lakshmana and Shatrughna  We can
follow Vishnu  reborn from mortal woman  on the reliefs of the Siva
temple  which are tolerably preserved  through the first stages of his
earthly career as Rama  but must renounce studying his subsequent story
on the exterior of the temples dedicated to himself and Brahma  where
the third tier of sculpture has altogether disappeared  save a few
mutilated bas reliefs  That is a great pity  for the illustration of the
Ramayana  by the artists entrusted with the decoration of the  chandi
Prambanan  judging from what we still possess  marks the apogee of
Hindu Javanese art  revelling in accessory ornament  it never surfeits
keeping the leading idea well in view  every embellishment adding to its
intrinsic value  The heavy moulding above the lowest band of chiselled
work of the Siva temple has fortunately protected it from being damaged
by falling stones  here we are able to discover the sculptor s technique
at close quarters and it is worthy of note that some of the curly lions
are wanting in their appointed places  This  coupled with the fact that
a few of the  apsaras  remained unfinished  while others  like statues
of gods on higher planes  have only been outlined  and spaces  evidently
contrived for ornament  present flat surfaces  has led to the conjecture
of a catastrophe which surprised the builders and made them suspend
their labours as in the case of the Bimo temple of the DiÃ«ng plateau

One of the salient features of the decoration at Prambanan  indeed of
all ancient Javanese art  SivaÃ¯te and Buddhist  is the representation
of animal life as an important factor in human destiny  If the Buddha
was called the Sakya Sinha  the Lion of the Sakyas  and his sylvan
embodiment adorns in many reproductions the Boro Budoor  his stateliest
temple  at SivaÃ¯te Prambanan we find the king of the desert extensively
utilised in the general decoration  together with the beasts of the
field under the bo trees and fanciful combinations of man and his lowly
friends  not dumb but of different speech  like the  kinnaris   the
bird people  The  Ramayana  bas reliefs echo the kindness 46  shown to
those humble companions in Indian myth  history and present day asylums
for the aged and infirm among them  Attending the monkey warriors
with whose help the simian deity Hanoman restored King Sugriva to the
throne of his forefathers at Kishkindhya  an allusion  it is thought
to the doughty deeds of the aborigines of the Deccan    bajings  47
and  bolooks  47  are gambolling round the house of the Most Awful
and Mysterious  once worshipped here by great nations whose very names
are lost  but whose art  giving a place to all creation in symbolic
expression of the divine  still teaches us the lesson that the animals
are also children of the gods  endowed with life not to be exterminated
to serve our pleasure and our vanity  or to be abused for our profit
but to enjoy the fullness of the earth and the good gifts of heaven as
we do ourselves  or might do if we were wise  Mother Nature  Siva s
sakti  Doorga  nurses at her bosom all her husband s offspring  without
distinction  and at Prambanan she superintends the growing world  as the
mistress of his household  in the highly finished form the artist has
given her  Loro Jonggrang  daughter of Ratu Boko of the Javanese legend
Not in her outward character of the demon steer subduing virago does she
attract her worshippers here  nor in that of the woman of the golden
skin riding the tiger  full of menace  but in that of Uma  the gentle
goddess who sheds light on perplexing problems of conduct  to whom one
turns in distress  Ideal of high born loveliness  Loro Jonggrang is
especially venerated by those of her own sex who are in trouble or have
a desire to propound in the fumes of incense they burn  barren matrons
praying for issue from their bodies to their lords and masters  like the
wives of King Dasharatha  virgins anxious to get married  pseudo virgins
who have trusted too much in the promises of their lovers  following the
hadat  established by herself at Prambanan and diligently observed
not only  it should be noticed  in that neighbourhood  but likewise
where no one ever heard of Loro Jonggrang and her  escapades d amour
insisting that  in the name of the precedent she set  consequences shall
be warded off  When  pasar    i e   market  falls on a Friday  48  her
votaries are exceptionally numerous  mostly native women entreating
deliverance from female ills or help in the attainment of feminine
wishes  Chinese  half caste and occasionally European ladies may
however  be observed among them  it is said that several happy mothers
of the ruling race at Jogjakarta and Surakarta owe their husbands
and children to Notre Dame de Bon Secours of Prambanan  that brides
having obtained their heart s desire in union with the beloved  the
bridegrooms in their turn repair to her shrine  after a honeymoon ended
in storm clouds  with an earnest supplication for means of release  This
explains the sprinkling of males among the fair devotees on Fridays
dejected looking persons who smear the statue of Doorga with  boreh
despite notices to desist  supplicating her to repeal former decrees
having different objects in view  of course  with their salvings of
Ganesa and Siva s  nandi   Favours are requested  pledges are given
votive sacrifices are performed  the gods and their attributes  Mboq
Loro Jonggrang in the first place  are wreathed and festooned with
flowers in compliance with an old Hindu custom so deeply rooted that
we may notice grave  turbaned  hajis  yielding to it  unheedful of
the Prophet s anathemas against those who commit the unpardonable sin
of idolatry  straying more widely from the right path than the brute
cattle  wicked doers  companions of hell fire whose everlasting couch

As the exhalations of the incense rise to the dying rays of the sun
and mix with the scent of the  kembangan telon   the flowers of
sacrifice   melati    kananga  and  kantil   the soughing of the
trees in the evening breeze repeats the lessons taught by an ancient
inscription found near the temples of Prambanan  and a summary of which
Hindu Javanese  Libro del Principe   taken from a translation by a
Panambahan of Sumanap  may be acceptable  What has been here set down
was in the beginning an ancestral tradition  very useful if observed
but  if disregarded  it becomes a curse  This inscription was made in
the year 396      in the third month  on a Friday in the sixth era
Let it inform you of the most exalted  of the road to enlightenment
and happiness  to attain your country s progress and prosperity  Proof
thereof will be cheap food and raiment  and universal peace  that those
who honour the gods may lead tranquil lives  Honouring the gods is the
perfection of conduct  Whosoever strives after that will be smiled
upon by them  for the practising of virtue provides access to heaven
which shines in splendour  and all gods will unite with the supreme
Siva Bathara Indra to assist the practiser of virtue  But whosoever
does wrong will go to perdition and his appearance will be monstrous
his shape like the shape of a dog  such a one acts unwisely because he
turns away from virtue and obeys his passions  which are his enemies
It seems good to know this in life  in order to practise virtue and
praise the godhead  believing in Bhatara  who has power over the world
possessing heaven and earth  The teachers must also be respected
without exception  because of their venerable charge  and you must
learn of them to honour Bathara above all gods  the Omnipotent  the
Ruler and Maintainer of everything  Praise him in order that you may
gain happiness and bliss even while you live on earth  Honour your
parents and the parents of your parents and their teachings  which are
inviolable  as they before you considered inviolable the teachings which
came to them from their parents and ancestors as received from the god
Bathara  who opened their hearts to probity  Know that they were allowed
to adorn themselves with fragrant flower buds wherever their influence
penetrated  this will also be your privilege after the purification of
your minds  Conduct yourselves honestly according to divine direction
acquire discretion and try to resemble the illustrious kings of the
past who compassed the felicity of their subjects  Be no regarders of
persons either among the good or among the bad  all are mortals in a
fleeting world  This consider  Bathara is the King of Kings who ordains
the holy institutions  Fill the place of a father among his children
If there are any of your subjects who act wickedly  command them to
mend their ways  if they persist in evil  teach them to distinguish
between what is good and what is bad in their souls  to the advantage
of the living  Excellent men must be appointed to manage the affairs of
the people  These three things are of highest importance  that proper
instruction be given  that your subjects become prosperous instead of
poor through oppression  that every one of them know the boundaries of
his fields  Persevere in honouring Bathara  Glorify him and inherit joy
Dress cleanly and keep your bodies clean  Acknowledge the omnipotence of
Bathara Giri Nata and  protected by him  no one can harm you  May his
superiority be reflected in you to confound the wicked doers  If you
desire a change of station  seek seclusion to do penance in order that
Bathara s brilliancy may become visible in you  Nothing is so beautiful
and so profitable to you as the conquest of your passions  subduing
them to a pure mind and lofty aspirations  vanquishing the enemies of
virtue who reveal themselves  it will help to proclaim your lustrous
righteousness  Glorify Bathara  He will descend in his beneficence to
show you the way  Reflect seriously  some day you must die  ponder
over the mystery of life and make the ignorant understand for their
own salvation  Behaving in this manner  happiness cannot escape you
kings of good rule  all of whose prayers will be listened to and with
whom no one can be compared  this is the sign of the eminence of the
sovereign who dominates men as the tiger dominates whatever breathes
in the forest  The gods will protect such kings to the benefit of
their subjects  traders and carriers of merchandise and labourers in
the fields  Nothing is denied to the obedient  for the gods ward off
evil from their thrones  evil is known in heaven before it touches the
mortals on earth  Glorify Bathara  The men of rank and high birth who
serve kings  must be of middle age  In their fiftieth year it behoves
them to retire from the world into prayerful solitude to die as a child
dies  let the body suffer for the soul  crowning the end of life  As
you grow in knowledge your wishes will be fulfilled and your soul will
leave its prison  The token of higher knowledge is evident  Where does
the soul go  It gains in beatitude or  if no progress has been made  it
seeks a refuge in the bodies of animals and people of mean appetites
Gaining in beatitude  it reaches heaven  the garden of rest  but hell is
the abode of sin  Cleanse  therefore  your thoughts  eschew impurity  Do
not favour the wealthy  nor despise the poor  all are equally confided
to your care  O ye  who are kings and represent the gods in your
kingdoms  listen to this admonition and know your responsibility for the
ultimate lot of your subjects  Bathara  the lord of life and death  will
call you to account  Woman has been created inferior to man  but many
men are enticed to wrong doing by the smooth speech of their women folk
who lack perception by the inscrutable decree of the gods  Woman wishes
to control man  taking her caprice for wisdom  always pressing him
to follow her fancies  The chronicles  however  mention the names of
queens like Sri Chitra Wati  Sinta Devi and Sakjrevati Drupadi  In the
days of Dhipara Jaga  Tirta Jaga  Karta Jaga and Sang Ngara bloody wars
devastated the land  kings were bewitched and changed into dragons and
elephants because they disregarded the ordinances of Bathara and also
because they were weak  not able to restrain their burning passion for
beautiful women  acting differently from that which behoves those in
authority  Possess your souls in continence  Bathara watches and you are
unacquainted with the hour of your death

The shadows of evening thicken  darkness gathers  darkness in the train
of Rahu  the devourer of sun and moon  robing the temples in gloom
Fire flies  darting from between the sculptured bo trees and festooned
foliage  begin to hold their nocturnal feast but subside before a red
glare  nascent in the holy of holies  They return  as if borne by
strange  wild melodies  and grow into the luxurious forms of luminous
nymphs  the  apsaras   who leave their stations round the house of fear
to dance their voluptuous dance of death  renouncing their allegiance to
the Mahadeva to court Kama of the flowery bow  consumed by the desire
to enjoy life and life s best before the approach of the mower cutting
them down  Their mates  the  gandharvas   excite them in their weird
revelry with songs and the musicians urge them with the clang of tabors
and cymbals  Shaped for the enchanting arts of love  skilled in the
wiles of female magic  they move in a whirl of passion  like flames of
fire  more redoubtable to man than the sword and arrows of his bitterest
foe  Luring the unwary who tarry at Prambanan when the fates  weaving
the web of the world  change the colours of day into night s blackest
dyes  when the lotus blossoms hang heavy on their stems and the air
is burdened with the odour of incense and sacrificial wreaths  they
intend his subversion by a mirage of delight  a hallucination of the
senses  and present the gratification of carnal desire as the triumph
of reason  Woe to him if he does not resist in the delirium of his
infatuation  The moment he tries to grasp their flitting forms  they
evade him as a mountain stream in spate  as the spray of its water
dashing down the rocks  as foam on the surging brine  The  apsaras
mock  the  gandharvas  hiss him  the musicians howl  all turning again
to stone  having instilled their subtle poison into his heart  He seeks
in vain the joy they held out to him  begs in vain for a draught of the
soma   the nectar of the gods  Then  shooting out from the great god s
abode as a flash of lightning  the red glare takes substance and Siva
appears in his most terrible aspect  Kala  destroying time  waving the
skull which springs from the lotus stem  menacing men and cattle  the
wild beasts of the woods  the fowl of the air and the fish of the sea
with the  trishula   the trident of desolation  Behind him the Devi  his
spouse  emerges from her niche  riding Vayu  the stormwind  not Doorga
or Uma disguised as Loro Jonggrang  but Kali  the furious  of hideous
countenance  crowned with snakes  dripping with blood  Lifting up her
voice above the roaring of her steed  she joins the Dread One  Rudra
the Thunderer  and passion and baffled desire become a portion of the
tempest she raises  the odour of the  kembangan telon  breathing agony
Mahakala  the Almighty Overthrower  deals death under his veil  But if
the night of terror begins in darkness  it will end in dawn and light
of day  all that lives  is born to die for new life to succeed  and so
teaches Siva himself  the Bhatara Guru  In adoration of Ganesa  the
fruit of his union with Parvati  wisdom will accrue to him who learns
the lesson  enlightenment from the spectacle of time  the demolisher
fortifying fecund nature  reanimating the universe in anguish of decay
Wisdom is the great gift  purification of the soul in abstinence from
the pleasures which drag it down  to keep the spark of the divine
undefiled in its earthly sheath with the aid of the father and the
son  whose distinctive qualities merge in Wighnesa  the vanquisher of
obstacles  Drinking their essence  man s hearing and knowing leads to
affection and commiseration  to the second Brahma Vihara  the sublime
condition of sorrow at the sorrow of others  and when dissolution
arrives as a reward  Yama  the judge of the dead  will find no cause
for reproach  The good will enter the diamond gate  but grievous
torment awaits the foolish who pamper the flesh and are ensnared by the
daughters of lust

CHAPTER V

MORE OF CENTRAL JAVA

   Le bon sens nous dit que les choses de la terre n existent que
   bien peu et que la vraie rÃ©alitÃ© est dans les rÃªves  CHARLES
   BAUDELAIRE   Les Paradis Artificiels  DÃ©dication


Except during a period of some four centuries and a half  from about 940
till the palmy days of Mojopahit  when declining Hindu civilisation  for
reasons as yet unexplained  sought a refuge farther east  Central Java
and especially that part of it known in our time as the Principalities
i e   Surakarta and Jogjakarta  has always been the heart of the
island  There lived and live the true Javanese  the people of heaven s
mercy  cherishing their old traditions  these and the beautiful scenery
of their fire mountains and fertile valleys are still theirs  whatever
else may fail  glory  power and freedom  They lived and live in their
world of custom and formality a life unintelligible in its inner
workings to the western brain  impenetrable to the western eye  There
are forces hidden in the Javanese mind  the resultant of a strangely
moved past  which we can never understand  though we may admire their
creative energy  revealed in the now conventional designs guiding the
hand of the potter  the wood carver  the goldsmith  the armourer  the
batikker   49  hereditary practisers of dying arts and crafts  in the
remains of a marvellous architecture long since altogether dead  No
chapter in the whole history of eastern art  says Fergusson  is so full
of apparent anomalies or upsets so completely our preconceived ideas of
things as they ought to be  as that which treats of the architectural
history of the island of Java      the one country to which they  the
Hindus  overflowed  was Java  and there they colonised to such an
extent as for nearly a thousand years to obliterate the native arts
and civilisation and supplant it by their own      what is still more
singular is  that it was not from the nearest shores of India that
these emigrants departed but from the western coast     A  linga
erected in the Kadu in the year 654 Saka  A D  732   a SivaÃ¯te symbol
of generation  marks the origin of an artistic activity whose most
brilliant period  the classical one of central Javanese architecture
as G  P  Rouffaer styles it rightly  begins with the construction of
such buildings as the Buddhist  chandi  Kalasan or Kali Bening  The
inscription of King Sanjaya in Venggi characters  and vestiges of
Vaishnav tendencies in the Suku and Cheto temples of a much later date
point to the worship of Vishnu  while Brahma s four sublime conditions
and more subtle transcendentalism do not seem to have attracted the
Javanese converts to HinduÃ¯sm  They could grasp the unity of Siva s
threefold functions much better and accepted him as Mahadeva at the
head of the Trimoorti  The advent of Buddhism in its  mahayanistic
form  the creed of the northern church so called  served to emphasise
native tolerance  SivaÃ¯sm and whatever there was of VishnuÃ¯sm
harmonised with Buddhism to the extent of borrowing and lending symbols
emblems and divine attributes  Hindu gods played puss in the corner
with Bodhisatvas  as already remarked upon in the preceding chapter
the  chandi  Chupuwatu surprises us with a  stupa linga   50  a
Javanese prince of the thirteenth century bears the expressive name of
Siva Buddha  the old Javanese  Sang Hiang Kamahayanikan  contains the
dictum  Siva is identical with Buddha  51  If more inscriptions had been
found  more light might have been thrown on the anomalous ornamentation
of  for instance  the Prambanan temples and the Mendoot  but SivaÃ¯te
records of the kind leaving the matter unexplained  Buddhist information
is still scantier  perhaps a consequence of Baghavat s followers not
excelling in epigraphy or literary labours of any description

If the backwash of great political events or religious discussion when
the IslÄm superseded older creeds  may have aided Kala  the Destroyer
in demolishing a good many buildings of the classical period  whose
sites even are sought in vain  it is certain that the pioneers of
western civilisation  proud of their superiority  willfully and wantonly
undid in many places work that had been spared by time and earthquakes
and volcanic eruptions and enemies born of the soil  devastating with
fire and sword their brethren s hearths and houses  Christian zealots
regarded the ancient monuments as assembly rooms of the Devil where the
benighted heathen used to foregather in idolatry  lodges of abomination
the sooner razed the better  a pious feeling often translated into
action on grounds of utility  the stones offered excellent building
material  Officials and  particulieren  52  of broader views  besides
acknowledging the serviceableness of  chandis  in this respect  went
recho  hunting 53  for the adornment of their houses and gardens  Quite
a collection has been formed in the residency grounds at Jogjakarta  the
nucleus of which was moved thither from the estate Tanjong Tirta  whose
former occupants  like most of the landed gentry  made exceedingly free
with the temples and monasteries in that neighbourhood  As neither they
nor the others bothered about noting where they got this or that piece
of sculpture  we are entirely at sea concerning the meaning of several
beautiful statues  This is the case   e g    with one of remarkably fine
execution  a crowned goddess  sitting on a lotus cushion and encircled
by a flaming aureole  pressing her hands to her bosom  She has been
fortunate enough to escape the fate of some deities who shared her
sequestration and were left to the care of the convicts detailed to keep
the Resident s compound in trim  a duty performed by whitewashing or
daubing them with a grayish substance  excepting the hair of the head
the eyebrows  the eyeballs and the  prabha   which the gentlemen artists
of the chain gang are in the habit of painting black  enhancing the
general effect by  restoring  lost hands and feet and damaged faces
after methods nothing short of barbarous  but therefore the better in
keeping with the traditional attitude of those in authority  For this
infamous disfiguration and desecration  which makes any one unaccustomed
to Dutch East Indian processes shudder with horror  never disturbed the
aesthetic sense or equanimity of the several occupants of the residency
who  during the last thirty five years  saw it going on under their
very eyes  the eyes of the representatives of a Government lavish in
circulars 54  recommending the country s antiquities to their care
Neither are those eyes shocked by the  museum  adjoining the residency
a jumble of plunder from  chandis  far and near  nor by the chaotic mass
of torsos  arms and legs  fragmentary evidence of wholesale spoliation
behind that pitiful exhibition of archaeology turned topsyturvy

So much for the statuary removed from the  chandis   as far as it can
be traced  Concerning the  chandis  themselves  it should be remembered
that the greater part has wholly disappeared  Hillocks  overspread
with brushwood  sometimes awaken hopes that by digging foundations
and portions of walls may be discovered  heaps of debris  tenanted
by lizards and snakes  point to structures of which nothing that is
left  indicates the former use  shattered ornamental stones speak of
magnificent buildings fallen or pulled down  glimmerings of splendour
that was  The temples still standing are reduced to ruins and diminish
almost visibly in attractiveness and size  Rouffaer 55  gave an
interesting example of their fate in the story of the spiriting away
of the  chandi  Darawati  in 1889 tolerably well preserved  though two
large statues of the Buddha had been dragged off to the dwelling of a
European in the  dessa  Gedaren  it was gone in 1894  vanished into air
The temples constructed of brick  like the  chandi  Abang  have suffered
even more  of course  than those of stone  the memory of whose grandeur
is retained in a few ghastly wrecks  Reserving the Buddhist remains
for later treatment and passing by the SivaÃ¯te caves with rectangular
porches in the Bagelen  mentioned by Fergusson  I shall deal here with
the  chandis  Suku and Cheto  and the most noteworthy ruins in the
southern mountains  The latter comprise the  kraton  of Ratu Boko  Mboq
Loro Jonggrang s father  as the natives call it  and the temple group of
the Gunoong Ijo  Of the legendary kingly residence little more is left
than a square terrace with portions of a wall and the sill of a gate
The  chandi  Ijo consists of a large temple of the usual polygonal form
with ten smaller ones and a pit which contained two stone receptacles
and strips of gold leaf with the image of a deity and an inscription
the buildings are in a sad condition  but decay has not impaired their
beauteous dignity and the landscape alone repays a visit to Soro Gedoog
an estate whose gradual reclamation of the jungle led to their discovery
in 1886 when ground was cleared for an extension of the plantations

The  chandis  Suku and Cheto are situated respectively on the western
and northern slope of the Gunoong Lawu  a volcano on the boundary
between Surakarta and Madioon  not less expressive in its scenery of
what heaven has done for this delicious island  Shortly after the
mysterious pyramids of Suku had drawn the attention of Resident Johnson
in the British Interregnum  Thomas Horsfield visited them and made some
drawings  The inscriptions and the sculptured ornament of Cheto were
reported upon by C  J  van der Vlis  in 1842  The groups belong to the
latest  most decadent period of Hindu architecture in Java and their
foundation  Suku being a few years older than Cheto  must have coincided
with the introduction of the IslÄm  Bondowoso  the son of the recluse
Damar Moyo  who assisted the King of Pengging against Ratu Boko and took
such signal revenge upon the latter s daughter  Loro Jonggrang  for
rejecting him  the uncouth slayer of her father  is supposed to have
erected the buildings at Suku  Those at Cheto owe their origin to a
prince of Mojopahit  who quarrelled with his brother  the ruler of that
empire  or  according to another legend  to a certain Kiahi Patiro  who
refused to become a convert to the new faith and repaired to the Lawu
where he lived as a hermit and was killed by Pragiwongso  an emissary
of the Moslim King of Demak   Linga  worship returned in the temple
groups of the Lawu to its crudest modes of expression  and Fergusson
who mentions the dates 1435 and 1440  speaks of a degraded form of the
VishnuÃ¯te religion  the  garuda   56  the boar  the tortoise  etc
being of frequent occurrence in the ornamentation  Junghuhn described
the staircases he found  which connected the terraces  and the statues
which hardly came up to the artistic standard of Prambanan and the Boro
Budoor  one of them distinguishing itself by a colossal head whose
measurement from chin to crown was three feet  half of the whole height
Comparing his description with the actual state of things  much must
have been removed  heaven knows whither  Notwithstanding the obvious
truth of Fergusson s remark that a proper illustration of Suku and
Cheto  and  I may be permitted to add  of the remains on the summit
of the mountain  whether originally tree temples or consecrated to
devotional exercises in the open   Ã  l instar  of West Java  promises
to be of great importance to the history of architecture in the island
very little has been done in that direction or even for the conservation
of the ruins where  recho  hunters and a luxurious vegetation vie in
obliterating the traces of most interesting antiquities  Junghuhn
sounded a note of warning apropos of the falling in of the peculiarly
constructed pyramidal temple  May 1838  but this and the other monuments
have been suffered since  as before  to crumble quietly away and the
easily removable sculpture to be carried off  Ganesa  in his manifold
reproductions  seconds on the Lawu his father Siva  head of the
Trimoorti  continuing the lead obtained seven centuries earlier in the
plain of Prambanan  and a systematic study of the reliefs  now covered
with moss and lichens  might shed a good deal of light on several
unsettled questions  One of those reliefs  blending the human and the
divine in the manner of the allusions to the  Brata Yuda  on the DiÃ«ng
plateau and the Rama legend on the walls of the  chandi  Loro Jonggrang
represents a complete armoury  with Ganesa  protector of arts and
crafts  between the armourer himself and his assistant who works the
bellows  If  with Rouffaer  we divide the long era during which the
Hindus  first as immigrants and then as rulers  merged gradually in the
aboriginal population  into a Hindu Javanese period of Central Java and
a Javanese Hindu period of East Java  the monuments of Suku and Cheto
belong evidently to the epoch of Javanese Hindu decline  decadent art
flowing back to its classical source  tarnishing original Hindu Javanese
conceptions  Leaving Buddhist architecture to be dealt with in the
last chapters  and before turning to the  chandis  of East Java  a
short historical review may aid in the appreciation of this decline and
subsequent paralysis of the creative faculty  Kartikeya  the god of
war  a younger son of Siva and Parvati  had his strong hand in this
and how he invested and divested mighty princes  who conquered or were
defeated and finally passed away  causing the rise and fall of glorious
kingdoms  is written in the  babads   the Javanese chronicles  by no
means such old wives  tales as Dominee Valentijn tried to make them out
but containing in their extravagance a kernel of stern reality  not the
less explanatory of the condition of the fairy island Java because the
magnanimes mensonges  of a vivid imagination animate the dull facts

Of the Hindu empire Mataram in Central Java nothing tangible is left
except the ruins referred to  a few objects in metal and stone
accidentally unearthed or dug up by treasure seekers  and some
inscriptions  title deeds  etc   the scanty  genuine charters of Java
as van Limburg Brouwer defined them  The name Mataram has been preserved
on a copper plate  dating from about 900  which agrees in this respect
with four other records  discovered in East Java  the capital of the
Maharaja i Mataram  is called Medang  For two centuries  from the
beginning of the eighth until the beginning of the tenth  Mataram seems
to have flourished as the most powerful state in the island  especially
aggressive towards the east  Native tradition  in fond exaggeration
of her importance  makes her sway the destinies of the world  Her
star waned suddenly  by what cause is unknown  but whether it was the
invasion of a mightier enemy or a natural catastrophe  the same as that
which overtook the builders of the DiÃ«ng and the plain of Prambanan
forcing them to leave their work unfinished  ancient Mataram sank into
insignificance  From the middle of the tenth until the beginning of
the sixteenth century  the successors of her former eastern vassals
that is whichever of them happened to be on top in the continual
struggle for supremacy  did in East and Central Java as they pleased
warring  intermarrying  annexing their neighbours  domains  only to
lose them again and their own kingdoms to boot  to usurpers  ambitious
ministers  popular governors of provinces  enterprising  condottieri
or mere adventurers favoured by Dame Fortune  In that overflowing
arena of high rivalry  dynasties succeeding one another with amazing
rapidity  Daha  situated in what is now Kediri  secured paramount
influence after Kahuripan  situated in what is now Southern Surabaya
then Tumapel  situated in what is now Pasuruan  became ascendant  then
Daha once more and  last of the great Hindu empires  Mojopahit  about
1300  to be overthrown  after two centuries of preponderance  by the
sword of IslÄm  Jayabaya  King of Daha  from about 1130 till about
1160  has been called 57  the Charlemagne of Java  in whose reign
learning and letters were encouraged  or the Javanese King Arthur  whose
life among his heroes  in peace and war  is reflected in the idylls
of the  Panji  cycle  at whose Court the famous poet Mpu Sedah began
his version of the  Mahabharata   the  Brata Yuda   finished by Mpu
Panulooh  author of the  Gatotkachasraya   while Tanakoong wrote the
Wretta Sansaya   a sort of  Epistola de Arte Poetica   When Tumapel
expanded  especially under Ken Angrok  troublous times arrived for
Daha  which could hardly hold her own against the encroachments of that
unscrupulous monarch  Ken Angrok or Arok  born in 1182 at Singosari
had seized the royal power after assassinating the old King in 1222 or
1223  The kris he used  had been ordered expressly for that deed from
the famous armourer Mpu Gandring  who was its first victim because he
tarried in delivering it  the tempering of the steel having taken more
time than suited the usurper s patience  Dying under the murderous
stroke  Mpu Gandring uttered a prophetic curse  This kris will kill
Ken Angrok  it will kill his children and grandchildren  it will
kill seven kings  The prophecy came true with wonderful exactness
Ken Angrok having married Dedes  the widow of the old King he had
despatched  was himself killed as the third victim of Mpu Gandring s
kris in the hand of a bravo commissioned by their son Anusapati  the
Hamlet of Javanese history  And how blood followed blood during the
hundred years of Tumapel s hegemony  how Ken Angrok s descendants
harassed their neighbours before the curse took effect upon each of
them  appearing like luminous stars in the sky of politics and war  and
then disappearing behind the shadowy cloud of untimely death  is it not
written in the  Pararaton  or Book of the Kings of Tumapel and
Mojopahit

The foundation of Mojopahit has been attributed to scions of several
royal families  among them to Raden Tanduran  a prince of Pajajaran
in West Java which  it will be remembered  owed its origin to princes
of Tumapel  The most widely accepted reading is  however  that a
certain Raden Wijaya  commander of the army of King Kertanegara
great grandson of Ken Angrok  profiting from his master s quarrels with
Jaya Katong  ruler of Daha in those days  carved out a kingdom for
himself  reclaiming  always with that end in view  a large area of wild
land  Mojo Lengko or Mojo Lengu  near Tarik in Wirosobo  the present
Mojokerto  King Kertanegara who  by branding the Chinese envoy Meng Ki
had stirred up trouble with the Flowery Empire  was unable to punish
this act of arrogance  and his violent death in a battle won by the
legions of Daha  meant the inglorious end of Tumapel  This happened in
1292 and the expeditionary force sent from China to chastise him for his
ungracious treatment of ambassadors to his Court  consequently found
their object accomplished or  more correctly speaking  unaccomplishable
when landing in 1293  But its leader indemnified his martial ardour
by entering the service of Raden Wijaya who  with his assistance
subjugated Daha  which had tried to reassume her former precedence
Firmly established on the throne of the realm he had fashioned out of
Daha  Tumapel and his own territory near Tarik  he refused  however
to pay the price stipulated by his Chinese ally and when the auxiliary
troops asked the fulfilment of his promises  arms in hand  he proved to
them that superior strength is the ultimate arbiter of right and sent
them home much diminished in numbers and pride  The Emperor of China
wroth that the beautiful princesses of Tumapel  daughters of the late
King Kertanegara  whom he had deigned to accept as concubines  were not
forthcoming  but stayed behind to adorn the harem of the self made King
of Mojopahit  ordered his unsuccessful generalissimo to be flogged by
way of example to other commanding officers  Raden Wijaya who  with the
kingly title  had assumed the name of Kertarajasa  enjoyed his royal
dignity only until 1295 and his ashes were entombed in two places not
yet located  in the  dalem   the inner  private part  of his palace
conformably to the Buddhist  and at Simping conformably to the SivaÃ¯te
ritual  not otherwise than King Kertanegara received last honours in the
guise of Siva Buddha at Singosari and in the guise of a Dhyani Buddha at
Sakala  and the remains of King Kertarajasa s successor were interred in
three places according to the VishnuÃ¯te ritual  circumstances from which
we may conclude that in East as in Central Java the different creeds
lived together in most amiable harmony

The kris of Mpu Gandring might limit the earthly term of the descendants
of Ken Angrok  it could not check their prowess while they were still
up and doing  Overlords of East and Central Java  extending their rule
to Pajajaran  they even looked for conquest to the other islands of
the Malay Archipelago  Under Hayam Wurook or Rajasa Nagara  in the
latter half of the fourteenth century  Mojopahit reached her zenith  a
record of 1389 mentions Bali as being tributary since about 1340  Aru
Palembang and Menangkabau in Sumatra  Pahang with Tumanik in Malacca
Tanjong Pura in Borneo  Dompo in Soombawa  Ceram and the Goram islands
acknowledged Nayam Wurook s suzerainty too  Seeing no more worlds to
subdue  he died and  as in the case of Alexander the Great  his empire
fell to pieces  in East Java itself Balambangan seceded from Mojopahit
proper and the Muhammadan propaganda  fanning discord between the
Hindu princes of old and new dynasties  prepared their common doom
The beginnings of the IslÄm in East Java have already been spoken of
with Gresik as a missionary centre  Maulana Malik Ibrahim as the first
wali  in that region and the conversion into Moslim vassal states
of the dependencies of Mojopahit  whose princes  combining under the
auspices of Demak against their liege lord  sealed his fate  Raden
Patah of Demak was a man of war and destiny  The fire of the new faith
burning fiercely within him  he hurled his defiance at the stronghold
of the heathen  speaking to the last King of Mojopahit  his father or
grandfather according to tradition  as Amaziah  King of Juda  spoke
to Joash  the son of Jehoahaz  the son of Jehu  King of IsraÃ«l  Come
let us see one another in the face   but with a different result  the
challenger from Demak came out victorious and Mojopahit ceased to exist
an issue fraught with grave consequences  This occurred about the year
1500 58  and Raden Patah  pursuing the royal family on their flight
defeated the King or one of his sons again at Malang  where a last stand
was made  But Gajah Mada  the Prime Minister of Mojopahit  founded a
new empire  Supit Urang  which comprised much of the territory once
belonging to Singosari  The Saivas also held out at Pasuruan  which
was invested by Pangeran Tranggana  a successor of Raden Patah  but
after his assassination by one of his servants  the troops of Demak
returned home  Pasuruan and Surabaya reverted  later on  to the Regent
of Madura  a son in law of Pangeran Tranggana  Yet  HinduÃ¯sm lingered on
in the island  its political power was only broken with the conquest of
Balambangan by the East India Company in 1767  and the population of the
Tengger mountain region did not commence to accept the IslÄm until very
recently

In the confusion which resulted after the death of Pangeran Tranggana
from the disruption of his domains into Cheribon  Jayakarta and Bantam
in the western  Gresik and Kediri in the eastern  and Demak proper and
Pajang in the central part of the island  the latter territory absorbed
Jipang and its Prince Tingkir  a scion of the royal family of Mojopahit
was proclaimed Sooltan by the spiritual authority of Gresik  the first
time we find that title mentioned in the history of Java  Sooltan
Tingkir appointed one of his trusted servants  Kiahi Ageng Pamanahan
governor of the tract of land which had preserved the name of Mataram
Kiahi Ageng Pamanahan improved the condition of the people and his son
Suta Wijaya  who had married a daughter of the Sooltan  making himself
independent by rebelling  by poisoning his father in law after his
having been captured and pardoned  finally by taking possession of
the regalia in the subsequent war of succession  became master of the
situation and laid in New Mataram the foundation of another state which
in the reign of his successor Ageng  1613 1646  gained the ascendency
over the rest of Java with Madura  subjugating even Sukadana in West
Borneo  Not  however  without strenuous exertion for Balambangan gave
a good deal of trouble in the East and the conquest of Sumedang in the
West  in 1626  taxed the military strength of the rising empire to
its utmost  When the East India Company began to make its influence
felt  Moslim solidarity proved a valuable asset as  for instance  in
the relations with Bantam and Cheribon  whose Pangeran proposed the
title of Susuhunan for Ageng  1625  before Mecca promoted him to the
Sooltanate  1630   In 1628 and 1629 he ventured to attack Batavia  the
new settlement of the Dutch  but had to retire and  what was even worse
by provoking those upstart strangers  he damaged his trade  they closed
the channels of export to Malacca and other foreign ports of rice  the
principal produce of the land   Mataram must now become our friend
wrote the Governor General to his masters  the Honourable Seventeen
and  indeed  Mangku Rat I   Ageng s son  found himself obliged to
sign a treaty of friendship with the Company  a dangerous friendship
Differences between their  friend  and Bantam with Cheribon were
sedulously fostered by the authorities at Batavia  the Company took a
hand in the putting down of disturbances created in East Java by Taruna
Jaya of Madura and KraÃ«ng Galesoong of Macassar  the Company patronised
and protected the reigning Sooltans  who moved their residence from
Karta to Kartasura  against pretenders and exacted payment in land
privileges  concessions  monopolies  etc   shamelessly in excess of the
real or pretended assistance afforded in quelling purposely manufactured
anarchy  precisely as we see it happen nowadays wherever western
civilisation offers her  disinterested  services to eastern countries of
promising complexion for exploitation by western greed

Mataram  trying to escape from the extortionate friendship of the
honey tongued strangers at Batavia  whose thirst for gold seemed
unquenchable  has its counterparts in benighted regions now being
civilised  after the time honoured recipe  interference which upsets
peace and order  more interference to restore peace and order with
the naturally opposite result  occupation until peace and order will
be restored  gradual annexation  The East India Company s mean spirit
of haggling was held in utter contempt by the native princes   grands
seigneurs  in thought and action  too proud to pay the hucksters with
their own coin  though bad forebodings must have filled the mind
for instance  of Susuhunan Puger  recognised at Batavia as Mataram s
figurehead under the name of Paku Buwono I   59  when near his capital
a Dutch fort was built and garrisoned with Dutch soldiers to back him
in his exactions for the benefit of alien usurers and sharpers  Like
the rat of Ganesa  they penetrated everywhere and the tale of their
relations to the lords of the land is one of tortuous insinuation until
they had firmly established themselves and could give the rein to their
sordid commercialism in always more exorbitant claims  Paku Buwono II
feeling his end approach  was prevailed upon  in 1749  to bequeath his
realm to the Company  but one of the most influential members of the
imperial family decided that this was carrying it a little too far
Mangku Bumi  60  brother of Paku Buwono II   supported by Mas SaÃ¯d  son
of the exiled Mangku Negara  61  and other  pangerans   princes of the
blood   stood up in arms to defend their country s rights and inflicted
severe losses on the Dutch troops in stubborn guerrilla warfare  This
led to the partition of Mataram between Paku Buwono III  and his uncle
Mangku Bumi  both acknowledging the supremacy of the Company  the latter
settling at Jogjakarta  the old capital Karta  under the title and
name of Sooltan Mangku Buwono  62  while Mas SaÃ¯d  who did not cease
hostilities before 1757  gained also a quasi independent position as
Pangeran Adipati Mangku Negara  which in 1796 became hereditary  With
three reigning princes for one  the power of Mataram was definitely
broken and Batavia assumed the direction of her affairs quite openly
the  thundering field marshal  Daendels emphasising her state of
decline and the British Interregnum bringing no change

In 1825 the divided remnant of Mataram  viz  Surakarta with the Mangku
Negaran and Jogjakarta with the Paku Alaman  63  was deeply stirred by
Pangeran Anta Wiria calling upon his compatriots to chase the oppressors
away  Born from a woman of low descent among the wives of Mangku Buwono
III   Sooltan of Jogjakarta  it seems that  nevertheless  hopes of his
succession to the throne had been held out to him when he assisted his
father against the machinations of his grandfather  Sooltan Sepooh
Mangku Buwono II    banished by Raffles in 1812  However this may be
he resented the settlement of the Sooltanate on the death of Mangku
Buwono III  upon Jarot  an infant son  and other circumstances adding
to his dislike of Dutch control  he raised the standard of revolt  The
Javanese responded with alacrity to an appeal which bore good tidings
of delivery as the wind  ridden by the Maroots who make the mountains
to tremble and tear the forest into pieces  bears good tidings of
coming rain to a parched earth  Anta Wiria  under his more popular
name of Dipo Negoro  and his lieutenants Ali Bassa Prawira Dirja  or
Sentot  and Kiahi Maja  gave the Dutch troops plenty of bloody work in
the five years during which the Java war lasted  1825 1830  It was the
last eruption on a large scale of the fire imprisoned in the native s
heart  the last sustained effort at regaining his independence  crushed
by the white man s superiority in military appliances  but occasional
throbbings  ruffling the surface as in Bantam  1888   the Preanger
Regencies  1902   Kediri  1910   etc   show that the volcano is by no
means an extinguished one  Though  kingdoms are shrunk to provinces and
chains clank over sceptred cities   the love of liberty  laid by as a
sword which eats into itself  does not own foreign dominion  and the
native princes  especially the Susuhunan of Surakarta and the Sooltan
of Jogjakarta  remain objects of worshipful homage  Their genealogy
remounts to the gods whose essence took substance in the illustrious
prophet Adam who begat Abil and Kabil on the goddess Kawa  the history
of their house begins with the arrival in the island  in the Javanese
year 1  of Aji Soko  they are the  panatagama  and  sayidin    shah
ad din    directors and leaders of religion  their Courts set the
fashion in high native society  Solo 64  being more gay and extravagant
Jogja 64  more sedate and solid  as a writer at the end of the
eighteenth century already remarked

The Dutch Government recognises the imperial or royal dignity of
Susuhunan and Sooltan by the superior position of its Residents in the
capitals of their Principalities  who  directly responsible to the
Governor General  correspond in rank to the general officers of the
army  while the administrative heads of the other residencies have
to content themselves with the honours due to a colonel  also by the
institution of dragoon body guards whose ostensibly ornamental presence
can be and has been turned to good account when the mental intoxication
arising from meditation on gilded disgrace  charged with the lightning
of passion  produces effects irreconcilable with the fiction that all
is for the best in this best of worlds  With the Government steadily
encroaching on the native princes  ancient rights  bitterness grows
apace and irritation at the recoiling weight of bondage lives on  though
colonial reports represent it as dead  Truly  in the three centuries
during which it pleased Kuwera  the fat god of wealth  to inspire the
strangers from the West  rich in promise but slow in performance
exacting and pitiless  to deeds of unprincipled rapacity  the people
have learned to hide their thoughts that worse may not follow  hoping
that time will set things right  But as everything points more clearly
to the fixed purpose of the Dutch Government to avail themselves of
every pretext for swallowing the Principalities as all the rest has been
gobbled up  there are those who cherish the memory of Dipo Negoro and
consider the necessity of new man offerings  the greater the need  the
greater must be the propitiation  On the whole  however  better counsel
prevails  deliverance being sought on planes of mystic exercise  silent
submission being practised in expectation of the consummation of a
higher will  and this is the native s secret as he repeats the lessons
inculcated in the  Wulang Reh   the treatise on ethics written by one
of the eminent of the past  Sunan Paku Buwono IV   May ye imitate our
ancestors  who were endowed with supernatural strength  and may ye
qualify for penitence  heeding closely the perfection of life  this is
my prayer for my children  be it granted  Meanwhile taxation increases
but who can object to that when in days of old the good people had to
pay for the privilege of looking at the public dancers  whether they
cared to look at them or not  when compulsory contributions to the
exchequer were levied upon one eyed persons for their being so much
better off than the totally blind  etc     Fancy a Minister of Finance
in Holland defending a vexatious new assessment on the ground of
arbitrary cesses in the Middle Ages

Hindu art had lost its vitality when the second empire of Mataram arose
in Central Java and the cult of the ideal was effected by modernising
currents from the eastern part of the island  Sanskrit  as the vehicle
of thought in Venggi and Nagari characters  made place for Kawi which
related in its oldest forms to Pali and in its symbols to the Indian
alphabets  evolved soon afterward into a specific Javanese type
SivaÃ¯te literature paved the way for the  Manik Maya   the  Bandoong
the  Aji Saka   the  Panji   and the  Menak   or  Hamza  cycles  the
Damar Wulan   as to Buddhist literature  Burnouf s comment upon its
inferiority holds also good for Java  no trace exists even of a life of
the Buddha  of  jataka  tales  except such as have originated in the
eastern kingdoms at a comparatively late date  Literary culture in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was a continuation of and throve on
the efforts of the great authors hospitably entertained at the Courts of
Mojopahit and Kediri  The Javanese language with the wealth of words it
acquired and the diversity of expression it developed  65  exercised and
still exercises in its four dialects 66  a vivifying influence upon the
Soondanese speech in the west and the Madurese in the east  Its script
like the people who speak and write it  and cling to their  hadat
the manners and customs of the  jaman buda   which  notwithstanding
their IslÄmitic veneer  they prefer to the law of the Prophet   its
script rejects Moslim interference and refuses to employ the Arabic
characters  sticking to its equally beautiful  aksaras  and  pasangans
Religions succeeding one another  generally without discourteous haste
Muhammadanism penetrated Central Java but slowly from the north  first
by the conversion of the great and mighty who profited by the example
of Mojopahit  then by grafting the idea of the one righteous god upon
the godless Buddhist or pantheistic Hindu creed of the  orang kechil
the man of slight importance who  up to this day  though fervent in
his outward duties as a Moslim  shows in every act that his individual
and national temperament is rooted in pre IslÄmic idiosyncrasies  The
heroes of the  Brata Yuda  and  Ramayana  are just as dear to him as
the pre IslÄmic saints whose legends are gathered in the story of  Raja
Pirangon  and the  Kitab Ambia   as the forerunners  companions and
helpers of the Apostle of God

One of venerable age in the imperial burial ground of Pasar Gedeh

with the salutations on imperial birthdays and coronation days in the

origin no less than the aspect  the dresses  the movements of the native

Central Java it is the human element that fascinates most  a waving mass

their hearts  as their mountains do the hidden fire  worshipping  tempu

the illustrious citizen of Florence  of the Porta San Piera  commented
on it

    Che l uso de  mortali Ã¨ come fronda
   In ramo  che sen va  ed altra viene   73

The country seats of Susuhunans and Sooltans  where they sought repose
from cares of state  often contained temples erected  if not in the
name then in the spirit of their kind of sacrifice  to Kama  the god
of love  smuggled into the practice of a later creed  They had no
wish to become the victims of their virtue like the excellent King
Suvarnavarna  they did not aspire to the fame accruing to Rama in
his relations to the female demon Shoorpanakha  personification of
sublunar temptations  And the manifold functions assigned to water in
their pleasances  to the limpid  running water of the cool mountain
rills  are characteristic of an island where a bath  at least twice a
day  preferably in the open  is both a necessity and a luxury which the
poorest does not dream of denying himself  Observe the crowds of men
women and children  always chaste and decent  disporting themselves
in lakes and rivers  every morning and every evening  note the names
of PikataÃ¤n  Kali Bening  Banyu Biru  idyllic spots and equal to the
classic  chandi  Pengilon  Sidamookti and Wanasari to the lover of a
plunge and a swim  screened by flowers and foliage  with the blue heaven
smiling on his joy  Passing by Ambar Winangoon and Ambar Rookma  the
remains of the so called water castle at Jogjakarta convey some notion
of the manner in which royal personages sought recreation  amusing
themselves in their parks of delight  fragrant and tranquil like the
restful Loombini  where Maya gave birth to the Buddha  toying with their
women in and round the crystalline fluid  An abundant spring within the
boundaries of the palace grounds led to the conception of this retreat
or  rather  these retreats  for there were two  connected by a system of
canals which speaks highly for native hydraulics  though the buildings
erected to obey a capricious will  show in their present ruinous state
how architecture had degraded since the Hindu period  its flimsy
productions being unable to withstand the first serious earthquake  Of
Pulu Gedong  to the northeast of the  aloon aloon kidool   nothing
is left but crumbling portions of the walls which jealously guarded the
privacy of the Sooltan s watersports  Of Taman Sari and Taman Ledok
situated in the western part of the  kraton   a good deal is still
recognisable  especially the structures on Pulu Kenanga in the largest
of the artificial lakes which are now dry ground  the one here meant
being incorporated into a  kampong   one of the several groups of native
dwellings inhabited by the Sooltan s numerous retainers  The whilom
islands convey in quite a picturesque way the lesson that human works
must die like the hands that fashioned them

Illustration  XIII  WATER CASTLE AT JOGJAKARTA

Centrum

The building of the  water castle   whose pavilions  artificial lakes
tanks and gardens spread over an area of about twenty five acres
was begun in 1758 by a Buginese architect under the orders of Mangku
Buwono I   a great raiser of edifices  as Nicolaas Hartingh 74  wrote
in 1761  and maker of  fountains  grotto work and conduits which
though completed  he orders immediately to be pulled down  not finding
them to his taste  thus squandering some little money   We possess a
description 75  of the  kraton  at Jogjakarta  dated September 1791
from the hand of Carl Friedrich Reimer  76  who speaks of  a collection
of gardens  fish ponds and pleasure pools   He probably visited Pulu
Gedong before proceeding to Taman Sari 77  and expatiates on the
spaciousness of the dwelling room in Pulu Kananga  where it seems that
the Court could find plenty of accommodation  But what made the greatest
impression on the expert in hydraulics was the arrangement of passages
and an apartment for prayer and meditation under water  as if the
Sooltan deemed it an advantage to worship surrounded by the babbling
stream  light and fresh air being provided through turrets rising above
the surface  In the place called Oombool Winangoon  situated on a low
level  with three tanks  fed from the great lake of Taman Sari  was a
cool retreat where the Sooltan used to rest a while after his bath
refreshing himself with a cup of tea  Alluding to the Sumoor Gumuling
Reimer remarks that the architect must have chosen a round form for
his structure to make it the better resist the pressure of the water
all round  The strange building which went by that name and consisted
of two concentric walls with a flat roof  78  taken for a subaqueous
house of prayer by the visitor of 1791  has also been very differently
explained  some see in its remains a dancing school  awakening visions
of the Sooltan s  corps de ballet  practising in the first storey to
the dulcet tones of the  gamelan   the native orchestra  that ascended
from the basement and aided them in going through their paces  others
connect it with functions never referred to in polite society and which
have nothing in common with praying  either with the heart or with
the feet  more correctly speaking  with the arms  hands and hips  for
Javanese dancing is no loose skipping and hopping about  but a graceful
and expressive play of the body and more particularly of the upper limbs
in rhythmic  undulating motion  Passing from one lake to the next  the
Sooltan s means of conveyance was the  prahu  Niahi Kuning  a gorgeously
decorated barge  given to him by the East India Company  other boats
plying between Taman Sari and Taman Ledok  were at the disposal of the
ladies of the royal household desirous of an outing with their babies
two small skiffs left their moorings every night alternately  at a
signal given on a  bendeh   to feed the fishes  which knew the sound and
assembled in shoals  The guard rooms near the northern watergate  of
which the remaining one   i e   the one not altogether fallen into ruin
shelters in the morning a motley crowd of sellers of fruit  vegetables
sweetmeats  etc   witnesses to the Company s dragoons  protecting and
shadowing their Highnesses of Surakarta and Jogjakarta with the princes
of their blood  already having been entrusted with that task in the days
of Mangku Buwono I

Of the delicately carved woodwork hardly a trace remains  but some
foliage and birds among flowers  executed in stucco  give evidence
of a good taste which knew how to make old motives subservient to new
requirements  Though a Muhammadan pleasance  designed by a Muhammadan
architect for a Muhammadan prince  the  garuda  over one of the
entrances  the Banaspatis on gables and fronts in Taman Sari and Taman
Ledok  the  nagas  coping the balustrades of the staircases  show that
Hindu conceptions continued to leaven Javanese art  The relations with
China and the consequent influx of Chinamen have also borne their fruit
in Central Java as in Cheribon and the eastern kingdoms  Reimer informs
us that the galleries and tops  now gone  of the several buildings
were constructed like pointed vaults  and were wrought  in the manner
of Chinese roofs   Pulu Gedong was famous for the lofty Chinese tower
erected near the spring which furnished the water for the  castle
its lakes  ponds  tanks and canals  and for the irrigation of its
grounds  The orchards  renowned for their mangoes and pine apples  the
vegetable   sirih  and flower gardens had a great reputation in the
land  assiduous attention was paid to horticulture on the principle
well understood by oriental gardeners  that flower beds  ornamental
groves and bowers are like women  that however much art and pains
are bestowed on their make up  the art of arts is the concealment
thereof     Writing this it occurs to me how properly a western version
of that universally approved maxim has been put in the mouth of
GÃ¤rtnerinnen    niedlich  and  galant

    Denn das Naturell der Frauen

Though Mangku Buwono I  was a contemporary of Goethe  his knowledge of
Faust  is extremely doubtful  but being an artist in his own way  he
took care that the natural scenery  assisted by art  should contribute
to a pleasant general impression in the distribution of the dwellings
for his retinue  native princes  and of his rank too   do not move an
inch inside or outside their  kratons  without numberless attendants at
their heels  In the  water castle  were apartments  not only for the
Sooltan  for the Ratu  his first legitimate spouse  for his other wives
and concubines  for the little family they had presented him with  but
for the dignitaries of his Court  officials of all degrees  secretaries
servants of every description  various artificers from the armourers
down to the  kebon kumukoos   the makers of  tali api   fire rope
necessary for lighting his Highness  cigars  There were reception
dining   living  and sleeping rooms for the Sooltan  his Ratu and
female relatives  each apart  common rooms for the  selir   wives of
lower degree   rooms for the instruction of their children  rooms where
his Highness  daughters spent a few hours every day in  batikking
guard rooms for the  prajurits   the male guards  guard rooms for
the female guards under command of the Niahi Tumanggoong  a lady of
consequence  who kept and keeps the  dalam   the interior of the
kraton   under constant observation so that no illicit  amourettes
shall occur in the women s quarters  and yet    There were store rooms
kitchens  workshops  prisons  halls set apart for the dancers  male
and female  the cream of the female dancers  the  srimpis  and girl
bedoyos   were probably housed in or near the principal pavilion on
Pulu Kananga  of which the Sooltan occupied the eastern and the Ratu the
western portion  Above all there were the bath rooms  dedicated to Kama
and his wife Rati of Hindu memory  and since the parrot is the  vahana
of that frivolous god  many are the unspeakable tales of revived rites
of his luxurious worship

The etiquette at Court is fitly illustrated by the two tea houses of
Taman Sari  the eastern one for the Grand Pourer out of Tea of the
Right  who presided over the preparation of the delectable beverage
for the Sooltan  and the western ditto for the Grand Pourer out of Tea
of the Left  who provided for the Ratu  A scrupulous punctilio is
ingrained in Javanese habits and customs  from high to low  on great
and small occasions  the native s mentality always reverting to
things which were  but never more can be  The homage done to sacred
objects  arms   gamelans   etc   by giving them a human name and a
title  80  venerating them as if endowed with supernatural faculties
recalls Polynesian fetishism  HinduÃ¯sm being blended with it in Siva s
trishula   Vishnu s  chakra   etc   which are still carried behind the
native princes among their  ampilan   81  The  upacharas  or imperial
and royal  pusakas  82  are treated with the utmost reverence when
shown at the appearance in public of Susuhunan or Sooltan  and their
bearers  the  koncho ngampil   who hold an honoured position at the
Courts of Solo and Jogja  may be considered direct successors of the
envoys of King Dasharatha on the reliefs of the  chandi  Loro Jonggrang
who bore his regalia when meeting Rama and Lakshama  The strange
ceremonial  preserved from the time when gods walked amongst men  seems
hardly antiquated  on the contrary very germane to  siti inggil  83
surroundings  One need not visit the  kratons  though  to notice how
the spirit of the past permeates all things Javanese  any well dressed
native getting out of his  sado  84  at the railway station or repairing
thither on foot for a journey with the fire carriage  will do  Even if
he cannot afford the few  doits  85  necessary and must impair his
dignity by going afoot  he has his retainers to look after his box
and  stuck behind  he has his magnificent kris in a sheath of gold
with a beautifully carved ivory handle  in nine cases out of ten a
pusaka   cherished like the kris Kolo Munyang of the Prince of Kudoos
or  as others allege  of a Susuhunan of Surakarta  who sent the weapon
which killed its master s enemies without human direction  to the
assistance of Pangeran Bintoro  then oppressed by a king of Mojopahit
The chronology of this legend is evidently a little faulty  but  O  the
wonders of Java s golden age  and  O  the superstitious honour in which
their memory is held by these lovable people  whose actual existence is
a dream of days gone by  And that happy dream  they ween  is a presage
of the future  prophesying the restoration of their fathers  heritage
If  nevertheless  the hour draws near of unconditional surrender  the
Dutch Government steadily and surely arrogating to itself the externals
with the substance of power in the Principalities  they will silently
submit to the  nivarana  of their ancient faith  the hindrance arising
from torpor of mind appointed to them in the  sansara   the rotary
sequence of the world  and seek consolation in the promise of their new
faith that the Lord will not deal wrongly with his servants  The life of
nations  like the life of men  starts running as the mountain torrent
and meets many an obstacle before it swells to a broad river in the
plains and flows tranquilly and mightily to the sea  also for Java it is
written

CHAPTER VI

EAST JAVA

   cosi da l ossa dei sepolti cantano
   i germi de la vita e degli spiriti  87

   GIOSUÃˆ CARDUCCI   Odi Barbare    Canto di marzo


When  suddenly  for reasons still unknown  the classic period of art
in Central Java closed  about 850 Saka  A D  928   East Java
awakened and entered on an era of artistic activity in every direction
which lasted until the fall of Mojopahit six centuries and a half
later  In architecture it offers nothing so grand and imposing as the
ancient temples of the Middle Empire  but much more diversity  and
numerous inscriptions  resembling  after 900 Saka  A D  978
in form and contents  what we possess of old Javanese literature
enable us in many cases to determine the dates and also the character
of the  chandis   found principally along the course of the Brantas
in the residencies Pasuruan  Kediri and Surabaya  Moving eastward  it
was there that Hindu civilisation made greatest progress  no more
in the vigorous enthusiasm of a young faith eager to proselyte  but
modified by and finally succumbing to the influences of the soil
the climate  the idiosyncrasies of the aborigines  The oldest dates
Madioon  Kediri  Surabaya and Pasuruan  fall between 890 and 1140
then we have a good many again from Kediri  1120 1240 and 1270 1460
and from Surabaya  1270 1490   also from Pasuruan  Probolinggo and
Besuki  1340 1470   Madura  1290 1440  and Rembang  1370 1390   finally
the constructive energy returning to Central Java  from Samarang and
Surakarta  1420 1460   Suku and Cheto bringing up the rear  In the palmy
days of Daha and Tumapel a sort of transition style was elaborated
under Ken Angrok and his descendants on the throne of Mojopahit  East
Java reached its architectural zenith  never equal in the grandeur of
its conceptions to the Boro Budoor or even the Prambanan temples  to
the symmetrical richness of the Mendoot  but making up in fantastic
decoration what it had lost in sobriety of outline  The builders
pandered to the unwholesome demand for that perfection at any cost
which Ruskin censures as the main mistake of the Renaissance in its
early stages  the workman losing his soul in exchange for consummate
finish  But  though they bear the impress of decadence  the products of
eastern Javanese constructive efforts are not wholly degenerate  never
coarse or vulgar and well worth looking at from more than one point of
view  The evolution of the ornament alone is exceedingly suggestive
the  recalcitrant spiral  which in Central Java ascends  decking the
supports  topples  as it were  in East Java  losing its character and
becoming a meaningless adornment of the casements of   e g    the
chandi  Panataran  the  kala  heads remain but the  makaras  change
into a flame like embellishment  where they are altogether dissolved
as in the  chandi  Jago or Toompang  it is safe to conclude with Dr
Brandes to late eastern Javanese influences  88

It has been conjectured that the migration of HinduÃ¯sm to East Java was
the effect of Buddhism gaining ground in the central part of the island
that the pronounced SivaÃ¯te tendencies of Mojopahit were a reaction
against Buddhist innovations  But it remains still to be proved that
Mojopahit  though worshipping Siva as the supreme god of the Trimoorti
adhered to his overlordship in all its orthodox purity  There are  on
the contrary  indications of VishnuÃ¯te leanings  of Buddhist heresy  of
a syncretism no less pronounced than that of Prambanan and the Mendoot
In the time of Old Mataram s hegemony  Buddhism must have ingratiated
itself to some extent with her eastern vassals and  though not one of
the temples in East Java is Buddhist after the fashion of the  chandis
Boro Budoor  Mendoot and Sewu  vestiges of the Bhagavat s doctrine
are undeniable in Kediri  Southern Surabaya and Northern Pasuruan
A fusion of SivaÃ¯sm and Buddhism has continuously controlled the
construction of the larger temples of the later eastern Javanese period
says Rouffaer  Statues found in many places   e g   in the  chandi
Toompang  are distinctly Buddhist and  what is most remarkable  though
of later workmanship than those of Central Java and of a different
style  tainted by decadent methods  they possess high merits as works
of art  In their SivaÃ¯tic surroundings they confirm the statements of
the Chinese traveller Hiuen Tsiang who  perambulating India between 629
and 645  before the persecution of the Buddhists commenced  remarked
upon the tolerance of the brahmins and  vice versa   a virtue the
Hindus carried with them to Java as already observed in the chapter on
Prambanan  The kings of Mojopahit followed the example set in those
regions  they were Saivas  Vaishnavas  Buddhists or followers of no
one creed in particular  ready to protect and prefer each of them
according to circumstances  In codes of law and poetry  SivaÃ¯te priests
and  sugatas   pious brethren on the Buddhist road to perfection  are
mentioned in one breath as conductors of the religious exercises on
festive occasions  invoking the blessings of heaven on harvests and
enterprises of peace and war  the poet Tantular calls the Buddha one
with the Trimoorti  89

The Muhammadans were not so indulgent when the Pangerans of Giri
increased in authority as spiritual leaders of their faith  successors
of Maulana Ibrahim  its first apostle in East Java  The hillock of Giri
became a centre of incitement to the holy war  particularly so under
Raden Ratu Paku or Sunan Prabu Satmoto  whose tomb is still an object
of Moslim pilgrimage  90  With his approval  if not on his instigation
the Muhammadan states on the north coast combined under Raden Patah of
Demak to compass the extermination of heathenism and he lived to see
the overthrow of Mojopahit  though dying shortly afterwards  If the
Moslemin yearned to gain Paradise  sword in hand  martyrs for their
Prophet s dispensation  those of the old creed remembered the power of
their  gods  blowing the  sanka   the war shell of Vishnu  who proved
to Sugriva and Hanoman his superiority over Wali by shooting his arrow
through seven palm trunks  who  in his fourth  avatar   as  narasinha
the man lion  ripped open the belly of the sacrilegious demon Hiranya
Kasipu  But Raden Patah  marching with his allies  marvellously helped
in the way of the Lord against the idolaters of Mojopahit  the swollen
with pride  proved to be the giant in the shape of a dwarf  Vamana
known from their god s fifth  avatar   conqueror of the three worlds
And Mojopahit  so great that the claims to the honour of her foundation
forwarded by as many princely houses as existed in those days  were
fused in the tradition of her divine origin  her capital with its
hundred gates and shining streets and palaces  the like of which had
never been seen  having sprung from the earth in one night as a flower
at the call of the fragrant dawn   Mojopahit was overthrown and  laments
the Javanese chronicle  the prosperity of the island disappeared  Not
the last but the strongest bulwark of HinduÃ¯sm had ceased to exist
bearing bitter fruit 91  of presumptuous pride indeed  the later Hindu
empires  even Balambangan  which gave so much trouble to New Mataram
and submitted only to the arms of the East India Company  leaving the
ancient creed to die of slow exhaustion in the Tengger mountains  were
nothing compared to her

Like the remains  near the  dessa  Galang  of the  kraton  of the kings
of the older empire of Daha  what has escaped total destruction of the
capital of Mojopahit is constructed of brick  The ruins are situated
about eight miles to the southwest of Mojokerto 92  in the valley of
the Brantas  near Ngoomplak was the site of a royal residence in the
building of which stone seems also to have been used  Raffles  visiting
those heaps of debris scattered over quite a large area  found but
scanty evidence of the fact that he trod the spot where great rulers
had employed great architects  raising great structures for posterity
to remember their great deeds by  Wardenaar  whom he had taken with
him as a draughtsman  might have stayed at Batavia  though in his
History of Java  he gives an illustration of  one of the gateways  and
says that the marks of former grandeur there are more manifest than at
Pajajaran  which  well considered  is saying very little  Now  a century
later  a century of continued neglect  the general impression is still
less calculated to prompt a vision of heroes subjecting thrones and
dominions in the short space left them by their ancestor Ken Angrok s
murderous kris  defying the grave  unmindful of Mpu Gandring s curse
Walking round in an effort to fit the scenery to historical dramas of
love  hate and ambition  extreme care is necessary to avoid stepping
on snakes coiled in dangerous repose or crawling among the brickbats
which represent the foundations of princely mansions  digesting their
last meal or hungry after the lizards that move restlessly in and out
of chinks and crannies  lively beasties  enjoying the sunshine until
snapped up  far more interesting really than the piles of rubbish
bearing meaningless names  The natives one meets  will spin yarns  ad
libitum  anent the numerous graves and crumbling substructures  but few
have an intelligible tale to tell  Here are portions of the city wall
there the remnant of the gate Bajang Ratu  half a mile farther the
aloon aloon   the  taman  or pleasance  the tanks for bathing  A road
in great need of repair  leads through the Trowulan  the interior
exterior roads may be taken through ricefields and teak plantations
to the tomb of Ratu Champa  distinguished by curtains which once may
have been white  Before a small building  enclosed by a fence  lies a
stone supposed to cover the entrance to a subterranean apartment  the
hiding place  it is said  of the last king of Mojopahit when his capital
was taken by the Moslim enemy  More graves surround that cache  graves
without and  to intimate the pre eminent importance of the elect thus
honoured  graves  with  dirty curtains  narrow strips of soiled cloth
sad offerings to the dead sovereigns of an empire of celestial fame  One
feels almost inclined to refuse credence to the grand past this ragged
display tries to commemorate and  from sheer disappointment  to join the
ranks of the sceptics who doubt of the capital of Mojopahit ever having
amounted to much  and maintain that  in any case  it had come down and
was of no consequence compared with Tuban and Gresik  already in 1416  a
century before its falling into the hands of the Muhammadans

At Mojopahit it is the same old story of quarrying for building
material  several sugar mills in the neighbourhood with the dwellings
of managers and employees  have been wholly or partly constructed of
Mojopahit bricks  In 1887 I saw them used for the abutments of bridges
foremen of the Department of Public Works superintending  A short
time before  twelve copper plates had been found with inscriptions in
ancient characters  which disappeared in a mysterious way  The  rechos
of Mojopahit were mostly left alone  a respectful treatment they owed
to their general clumsiness  Some two or three miles from the ruins
of the capital  a goodly number stand or lie together fair samples of
statuary of the first eastern Javanese period  in its extravagance and
exaggeration a travesty of the classic art of Central Java  crudity of
conception floundering in a redundancy of form also observable at the
chandis  Suku and Cheto  after the fall of Mojopahit  in the second
period  the sculptor reverted to a close study of nature as manifested
at the  chandis  Toompang and Panataran  in the third  Hindu methods
getting crowded within ever narrower limits  his fancy betrayed him
again into lavish detail as exemplified in old Balinese imagery  At the
gradual extinction of Hindu ideals of beauty  realised in decaying stone
and brick  in statues defaced and vanishing like dwindling phantoms
a growing sensation of emptiness  emphasised by vague reminiscences
of the artistic fullness of the  jaman buda   claiming amends from
succeeding creeds  received little from IslÄm and absolutely nothing
from Christianity  Under Dutch rule very few attempts at style in Java
and the other islands of the Malay Archipelago have been made at all
and of these few only one has resulted in an achievement not altogether
ridiculous  namely the old town hall  begun in 1707 and finished in
1710  of old Batavia  where the Resident has his office  by the natives
very appropriately called  rumah bichara    i e    house of talk   With
one or two utterly tasteless exceptions  the rest of the Government and
private buildings  including the palaces of the Governor General at
Weltevreden and Buitenzorg  descend in their architecture to the lowest
grade of the commonplace  To his Excellency s ill kept country seat
in the Preanger subverted Mojopahit seems almost preferable
notwithstanding the squalor of its threadbare  kaÃ¯n klambu  decoration
the meanness of the viceregal reception  and living rooms at Chipanas is
not even picturesque and surely some of the public money regularly paid
out for the maintenance of the  Government hotels  might be profitably
expended on the improvement of the surroundings of Her Majesty the Queen
of the Netherlands  representative in the Dutch East Indies  including
the rickety furniture  shabby napery  etc   which has a pitiful tale of
unseemly parsimony to tell  the superiority of high rank needs decorum
and nowhere more than in oriental countries  a truth lately too much
lost sight of by officials  high and low  who  following the example set
at Buitenzorg  hoarding against the hour of their demission  presume on
their  prestige  without anything to back it

Mojopahit had ceased to exist and the Muhammadans with the Christians in
their wake overran Java  despoiling the land in which toleration and art
could no more flourish  but dissension throve as the tree prophetically
imaged at the Boro Budoor  whose branches bear swords and daggers
instead of wholesome  luscious fruit  The old quarrels over political
supremacy were surpassed in violence by religious strife  and fanaticism
is still held responsible in our day for disturbances conveniently
ascribed to Moslim cussedness when the acknowledgment of the real cause
discontent born from over taxation  would be tantamount to a confession
of administrative impotence  It was not Hanoman  the deliverer of
Sita  who troubled the repose of Ravana s garden  but the  raksasas
and  raksasis  who kept her in bonds  and there are two solutions of
the Dutch East Indian problem  independent of the issue celebrated in
the  Ramayana  and both suggested in the ornament of Java s temples
the devourer Time destroying all with his sharp teeth  and the lion
or tiger  to preserve the local colour  master of the fleeting moment
with a garland of flowers in his mouth  image of the clouded present
holding out the promise of a brighter future  The two auguries  dark yet
hopeful  belong to one old order of ideas  prefiguring things to come
in dubious language  after the wont of oracles  ancient and modern  and
we can choose the forecast which likes us best  So did the princes of
Daha  Tumapel and Mojopahit  not to mention the lesser fry  creatures of
a breath as we deem them now  doughty warriors and far seeing statesmen
to their contemporaries  who consulted their soothsayers before treading
the fields of fame and blood whence they were carried to their graves
admiring nations rearing the mausoleums which now constitute the
greater part of the historic monuments of East Java  The  Pararaton
mentions no fewer than seventy three structures of that description
Such as have been left are  for various reasons  hard to classify
the greatest difficulty arising from their bad state of preservation
though deciphered dates furnish important clues  for instance regarding
some  chandis  in Kediri  Papoh  1301   Tagal Sari  1309   Kali Chilik
1349   Panataran  1319 1375   93  the last named being probably
the principal tomb of the dynasty of Mojopahit  Springing from the
soil in amazing dissimilitude  their architects seeking new modes of
expression in new forms and never hesitating at any oddity  at any
audacity to proclaim the message of artistic freedom from convention
they struggled free from the sober lines and harmonious distribution
of spaces always maintained in Central Java  to run riot in fantastic
innovations  Yet  they held communion with nature and neither shirked
their responsibility nor sinned against the proper relations between
their purpose and the visible consummation of their task as those of
our modern master builders do who contrive churches like barns or
cattle sheds  stables like gothic chapels  prisons like halls of fame
and cottages like mediaeval donjons  From such architectural absurdities
it is pleasant to turn   e g    to the  chandi  Papoh  a temple whose
corner shrines might pass for daintily wrought golden reliquaries inlaid
with jewels  when the minute detail of their exquisite decoration
is shone upon by the setting sun  or to the  chandi  Sangrahan
when warmed to life from death and fearful decay  by the blue of a
measureless sky  again budding from the earth  lovely as the lotus
in the bliss bestowing hand of one of the five finely chiselled but
headless statues near by

Holiness in East Java  as everywhere in the island  took naturally
to bathing  The retreat Bookti in the district Rembes  set apart for
that pastime  according to the legend by Semu Mangaran  first king of
Ngarawan  the later Bowerno and still later Rembang   had and has many
rivals  nearly all in possession of antiquities to show their sacred
character and the regard in which they were held  Some  like Bookti
and Banyu Biru  the deservedly popular  blue water  of Pasuruan  are
enlivened by colonies of monkeys  descendants of the apes kept there in
Hindu times  beggars by profession  whose antics reap a rich reward
Sarangan in Madioon  Trawulan and Jalatoonda in Surabaya  Jati Kuwoong
and Panataran in Kediri  Ngaglik and Balahan in Pasuruan  shared in
olden times the renown which now is principally divided between Banyu
Biru and Wendit  not to forget Oombulan  delightful spots  typical of a
land where life is a continuous caress  Ngaglik has a beautiful female
statue  evidently destined to do service as a fountain figure after
the manner of the nymphs which grace John the Fleming s 94  Fontana
del Nettuno in Bologna and countless other waterworks of his and the
succeeding period  Wendit has SivaÃ¯te remains  the prime god s  nandi
statues of Doorga  Ganesa  etc   most of the  lingas  and  yonis  that
used to keep them company as reminders of their inmost nature  have been
carried off  Banyu Biru has a statue of Doorga   raksasas   fragments
of Banaspatis  etc   and a very remarkable image of Ganesa with female
aspect  an object of veneration  especially on Friday evenings when
flowers and copper  even silver coins are strewn round to propitiate
his dual spirit  candles are lighted and sweetmeats offered to the
ancient deities taken collectively  The  chandis  Jalatoonda and Putri
Jawa served a double purpose  devotion and ablution  facilities for an
invigorating bath playing a prominent part  The former  in the district
Mojokerto  residency Surabaya  is the mausoleum of King Udayana  father
of King Erlangga  and one of the oldest monuments in East Java  the
latter  in the district Pandakan  residency Pasuruan  has much in
common  as to ornament  with the  chandi  Surawana of the year 1365 and
belongs on the contrary to the younger products of Hindu architecture
Chandi  Putri Jawa means  temple of the Javanese princesses   and
Ratu Kenya  the Virgin Queen of Mojopahit  1328 1353   who spoiled her
reputation for chastity by losing her heart to a groom in her stables
and making him share her throne  as the  Damar Wulan  informs us  may
have repaired thither with her ladies in waiting to sacrifice and
disport in the swimming tank which is still replenished with water from
the neighbouring river  flowing through the cleverly devised conduits
or the women of her luckless last successor  King Bra Wijaya  may have
taken their pleasure there along with their devotional exercises before
the Moslim torrent swamped their lord and master s high estate  harem
and all

Cave temples have been found in Surabaya  Jedoong   in Besuki  Salak
and in Kediri  Jurang Limas and Sela Mangleng   The latter  of greatest
interest and Buddhist in character  can be divided into pairs  Sela
Baleh and Guwa Tritis  Joonjoong and Jajar  They are easily reached
from Tuloong Agoong and  though the removable statuary is gone
except the heavy  raksasas   defaced figures on pedestals  etc   the
sculpture of the interior walls of the caves remained in a tolerable
state of preservation  Above on the ridge is a spot much resorted to
for meditation and prayer  where the view of the charming valley of
the Brantas  bounded by the beetling cliffs of the south coast  the
treacherous Keloot to the northeast and the majestic Wilis 95  to the
northwest  prepares the soul for communion with the Spirit of the
Universe  Remains of brick structures abound in East Java  besides the
ruins of Daha and Mojopahit we have  for instance  the walls of the Guwa
Tritis under the jutting Gunoong Budek  the  chandis  Ngetos at the foot
of the Wilis  Kali Chilik near Panataran  Jaboong in Probolinggo and
Derma in Pasuruan  The  chandi  Jaboong presents a remarkable instance
of tower construction applied to religious buildings in Java as further
exemplified  conjointly with terraces  in the  chandi  Toompang  The
surprises offered by the  chandi  Derma are no less gratifying  firstly
to travellers in general who visit Bangil and  approaching the temple
which remains hidden to the last moment  suddenly come upon it in an
open space adapted to full examination  secondly to archaeologists in
particular because  dating from the reign of Mpu Sindok  850 Saka or
before  and therefore one of the oldest monuments in East Java  if not
the oldest in a recognisable state of preservation  it must be accepted
as the prototype of Javanese architecture bequeathed by Old Mataram and
is a valuable help to the study of the ancient builders  technique
showing  among other things  says Dr  Brandes  that the larger
ornamental units are of one piece of terra cotta  joined to the masonry
by means of tenons and mortises

About a mile to the southeast of Malang  on the top of a hill near the
kampong  Bureng  are traces of more buildings constructed in brick
the ruins of Kota Bedah  The foundation of that city is attributed to
a son of Gajah Mada  chief minister of the last king of Mojopahit who
after his master s fall  fled eastward and  subjecting Singosari with
adjoining territories  became the progenitor of the dynasty of Supit
Urang  The Moslemin pushing on and harassing the Saivas wherever met
invested Kota Bedah but  not prevailing against the strong defence of
its commander Ronga Parmana  they caught the citizens  pigeons which
flew over their camp and  attaching pieces of burning match rope to
the birds  wings and tail feathers  they set fire to the thatch of
the houses within the walls and so gained their end  Thereupon they
destroyed the royal residence Gedondong  to the east of Malang  and
those of Supit Urang took refuge in the Tengger mountains  This is
one of several traditions explaining the existence of SivaÃ¯te remains
scattered in that neighbourhood  at Dinoyo  Karanglo  Singoro  Katu
Pakentan  etc  On the road to Toompang stands the  chandi  Kidal  one
of the best preserved in Java  only the upper part of the roof having
fallen down  It is the mausoleum of Anusapati  the Hamlet of Javanese
history  referred to in the preceding chapter  who was killed in 1249
by his step brother  His likeness has been sought in an image of Siva
on the supposition that some statues of deities there erected  which
point to the use of living models  represent the features of exalted
personages  An enormous Banaspati over the entrance with smaller ones
over the niches   garudas  and lions form the principal decoration in
frames of highly finished ornament  Dr  Brandes remarks that in contrast
to the decoration of the temples in Central Java  the heavy ornament
of the relief tableaux is here distributed over the parts which carry
the weight of the superstructure  while the lighter ornament finds
employment on the panels and facings  The methods of construction
and the treatment of details mark clearly a transition to the younger
period of eastern Javanese architecture best illustrated by the  chandi
Panataran

Somewhat older  built in 1278 as a mausoleum for Kertanegara  the
last king of Tumapel  who reigned from 1264 to 1292 and was killed in
battle by Jaya Katong  King of Daha  is the  chandi  Singosari  near
the railway station of that name  an excellent starting point for an
ascension of the fire mountain Arjuno or Widadaren  It has been called
one of the most unfortunate monuments in the island  not  presumably
because it shared the common lot  being gradually deprived of its finest
ornament while its stones were freely disposed of for building material
without the local authorities minding in the least  but because the
spoliation could be watched by a comparatively large number of planters
and industrials  settled in the neighbourhood  none of them interfering
unless to its detriment  Insurmountable difficulties of transportation
opposed the removal of the colossal  raksasas  and so they were left
with a  nandi   a sun carriage and  among fragments too defaced for
recognition  a Ganesa and a female Buddhist saint  for this temple tomb
is of a mixed character in its religious aspect  A Javanese chronicle
relates that Kertanegara was buried at Singosari in 1295  three years
after his death  in the guise of Siva Buddha  and at Sakala conformably
to a more pronounced Buddhist rite  He was considered a wise ruler
notwithstanding his abusive attitude towards China  which had such
dire results  He built an edifice  continues the  babad   divided into
two parts  the lower one SivaÃ¯tic  the upper one Buddhistic  because
in his life he prided himself on being a Saiva as well as a Buddhist
A richly ornamented  kala  head in eastern Javanese style testifies to
the admirable technique of the builders and decorators  According to
popular belief a subterranean passage leads from Singosari to Polaman
about six miles away  a place of sacrifice in Hindu days  and another
to Mondoroko  close by  the site of a ruin with a graceful statue of a
female deity  two smaller ones which remind the beholder of Siva s and
Doorga s creative faculties  and sadly damaged bas reliefs  In 1904
an inscribed stone was recovered  at the intimation of a native  from
a pond near Singosari  Confirming the data furnished by the Javanese
chronicles  the inscription states that in 1351 Gajah Mada  the Prime
Minister of Mojopahit  acting for King Wisnuwardhani  founded a
temple tomb  sacred to the memory of the priests  Saivas and Buddhists
who  in the year 1292  had followed their King Kertanegara in death  and
of the old Prime Minister who had been killed at his feet      See here

Illustration  XVII   CHANDI  TOOMPANG

Archaeological Service through Charls and van Es

Finest and most interesting of the Malang complex is the
chandi  Jago  about twelve miles to the east of the capital of the
assistant residency  in the  aloon aloon  of Toompang and hence more
commonly named  chandi  Toompang  It was the first taken in hand by
the Commission appointed in 1901 and we owe most of the information
summarised in the following lines  to Dr  Brandes  reports on this
archaeological debut  A rare example of tower construction of the kind
also observed in the  chandi  Jaboong  superposed on a raised level
reached by terraces like those of the  chandis  Panataran and Boro
Budoor  the extraordinary Javanese mixture of SivaÃ¯sm and Buddhism
with a dash of VishnuÃ¯sm has affected it to such a degree that even
a recent description declares it to be a Buddhist pit temple  a
contradiction in terms  Begun in the middle of the thirteenth century
i e   in the time of Tumapel s political ascendency when SivaÃ¯sm
was the state religion  if we may speak of a state religion among
peoples and princes whose predominant article of faith was tolerance
and concession of equal rights to all religions  some of the learned
investigators suppose with Professor Speyer that the Buddhist note was
a consequence of the persecution of the adherents of Gautama s creed
in India and the hospitality extended to the emigrants all over the
island Java  However this may be  syncretism became rampant in both the
ground plan and the decoration of the  chandi  Toompang  conceived as
an elevated dodecagonal structure on the highest of three irregularly
shaped terraces  something quite exceptional in Javanese architecture
Apparently while the building was in progress  remarks Rouffaer  changes
were made in the original project  and the more is the pity that the
temple proper has fallen into almost complete ruin  not only that the
roof is lacking  but the toppling back wall has dragged the greater
part of the north and south walls down with it  The front or west wall
has held out to a certain extent with the gateway  the chief entrance
a lofty  rectangular  monumental passage  ornamented on both sides and
locked with a key stone whose smooth middle space was destined  in the
opinion of Dr  Brandes  to receive  but never did receive  the date of
completion  Heaps of debris round about lead to the conjecture that the
whole was encircled by a wall of brick and that the dwellings of the
keepers or officiating priests were composed of the same material

Several of the bas reliefs fortunately escaped destruction and found
an interpreter in Dr  Brandes  to whom we also owe explanations of
the stereotyped decorative scrolls and flourishes  Though inferior in
workmanship to the reliefs of Panataran  those of Toompang   speaking
reliefs as he called them  are vigorously animated  gaining in interest
to the devotee as he ascends the terraces  their masterly treatment
culminating in what has been preserved on the portion still standing of
the temple walls  No better illustration of high and low life  of the
nobility and the riff raff portrayed in classic Javanese literature
could be imagined  the typical perfect knights and sly buffoons
are there in crowds  princes and courtiers  warriors and peasants
gallivanting beaux and love sick maidens  jealous husbands and frisky
wives  worldwise sages and babbling fools  Javanese Don Quijotes riding
out with their trusty squires of the Sancho Panza species  go betweens
neither better nor worse than Celestina  entangling dusky Melibeas
Every honourable soul is set off by his or her vulgar counterpart  of
the earth earthy  the  panakawan   page  and the  inya   nurse  play
most important rÃ´les  almost equally important with those of the hero
and heroine  and their characters are  conformably to the requirements
of Javanese literature  clumsy and coarse but droll  their actions
whether they accomplish or fail to accomplish their tasks  reflect the
performances of the born ladies and gentlemen whom they accompany  who
lose each other and are reunited  who quarrel and make up  always in a
comely  stately way  proud and sensitive  expressing their feelings in
graceful gestures corresponding with the choicest words  When treating
of Panataran  the ornamentation of the ancient monuments of East Java
in its relation to Javanese literature will be more fully discussed
Here  however  belongs a reference to Dr  Brandes  ingenious explanation
of the slanting stripes or bars  left uncarved at irregular intervals
on the narrow tiers of bas reliefs at the  chandi  Toompang  comparing
those sculptured bands with the  lontar  96  leaves on which the tales
whose illustration they furnish  were originally written  he saw in them
the finishing strokes of the different chapters

The statuary of the  chandi  Toompang has been removed  for the greater
part  to the Museum at Batavia and  possibly  one or two images  with
Professor Reinwardt s invoice of 1820  to that of Leyden  The deities
are brilliantly executed  of idealistic design  to borrow Rouffaer s
words  exuberant to the point of effeminacy  Some of them show the
conventional Hindu type and we can imagine the wonderful effect they
produced among the essentially Javanese scenes chiselled on the
walls  For their inscriptions Nagari characters have been used  a
circumstance adduced to prove the predominant Buddhist significance of
this temple  The principal statue seems to have been the decapitated
and otherwise damaged  eight armed  97  colossal Amoghapasa  Lord of
the World  reproduced by Raffles  including the head   carried to
Malang some years ago by a Dutchman   he informs us  which  symbolic
of unity with Padmapani  displays Amitabha  the Dhyani Buddha of the
West  the Buddha of Endless Light  in the manner of a frontal  The
goddess Mamakhi  scarcely less beautifully cut and also reproduced by
Raffles in his  History of Java   was carried to England  in tota  by
himself  Efforts to trace her whereabouts have not met with success
she remains more securely hidden  probably in one of the store rooms
of the British Museum  than the stone with inscription recording
an endowment  transported from Java to the grounds of Minto House
near Hassendean  Scotland  Talking of carrying away  a little to the
southeast of the  chandi  Toompang stood a temple of which hardly a
stone has been left  a little to the south of the  chandi  Singosari
another is visibly melting into air  The Chinese community at Malang  as
Dr  Brandes informed the Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences  boast
of a permanent exhibition of Hindu statuary and ornament  consisting of
more than 160 numbers  gathered together in the neighbourhood and on
view in their cemetery  Baba collects SivaÃ¯te and Buddhist antiquities
with great impartiality  subordinating religious scruples to practical
considerations  as when he lights his long stemmed pipe at one of
the votive candles on the altars in his places of worship  Excellent
opportunities for the study of Chinese influences on Javanese art are
offered by the decoration of his temple in Malang with its motives
derived from creeping  fluttering  running  pursuing and fleeing
things  tigers  deer  dragons  bats  especially bats  shooting up and
down  flitting off  swiftly turning back  circling and scudding  The
mural paintings of a good many other  klentengs   too  are of more
than passing interest since they promote a right understanding of the
development of the Greater Vehicle of the Law  which in Java exchanged
fancies and notions with both Chinese Buddhism and TaoÃ¯sm  discarded
the classic for the romantic  if the expression be permissible in this
connection  and still continues to live among the island s inhabitants
of Mongolian extraction  as SivaÃ¯sm among the Balinese  their creative
thought moulding old fundamental ideas in unexpected new forms  If
Buddhism brought new elements into Chinese art  stimulating ideals and
religious imagery  as the Count de Soissons remarks  98  leading  for
instance  to sublime personifications of Mercy  Tenderness and Love
the debt is repaid and emigrating Chinese decorators shower the graces
of their benign goddess Kwan Yin on their labours in distant climes
As to Java  with which China entertained relations from the remotest
Hindu period  they animated and reshaped in endless variation the
ornament they found  the  makaras   the  kala  heads  at last  in their
saÃ¯ shiho  tracery  being gradually supplanted by the bat motive

Illustration  XVIII   CHANDI  PANATARAN

Archaeological Service through Charls and van Es

The  chandi  Panataran is the most beautiful  for many reasons also
the most remarkable temple in East Java and  with the exception of the
Boro Budoor  the largest in the whole island  It was discovered by the
American explorer Thomas Horsfield  Its foundations and the interior
of its sepulchral pit are constructed in brick  its terraces are in
general design not unlike those of the  chandi  Toompang  among its
statues  stolen and scattered far and wide  it may have contained images
of Buddhist purport and inspiration  SivaÃ¯tic in aspect  however  as it
stands now  it is the only one of the monuments in Kediri sufficiently
preserved to determine its religious origin  Fergusson classes
the  chandi  Panataran with the tree  and serpent temples whose most
peculiar feature in the residencies Malang and Kediri consists in having
a well hole in the centre of their upper platform  extending apparently
to their basement   and the suggestion occurring to him  as at all
likely to meet the case   is  that they were tree temples  that a sacred
tree was planted in these well holes  either in the virgin soil  or that
they were wholly or partially filled with earth and the tree planted
in them   He compares the  chandi  Panataran with the Naha Vihara or
Temple of the Bo tree in Ceylon and bases its claim to being called a
serpent temple on the fact that  the whole of the basement moulding
is made up of eight great serpents  two on each face  whose upraised
breasts in the centre form the side pieces of the steps that lead up
to the central building  whatever that was  These serpents are not
however  our familiar seven headed Nagas that we meet with everywhere
in India and Cambodja  but more like the fierce  crested serpents of
Central America   So far Fergusson  but the well or pit  notwithstanding
the veneration of which the bo tree was the object  seems rather to have
been a receptacle for the ashes of the princes of Mojopahit whose memory
the founder of this mausoleum  probably Queen Jayavisnuvardhani
the above mentioned Ratu Kenya  immortalised in the  Damar Wulan
intended to perpetuate  The  raksasas   guardians of the ruins of the
principal structure  bear the date 1242 Saka  A D  1320   a minor
temple and terrace give the dates 1369 and 1375  from which it has been
concluded that they were added in the reign of Ratu Kenya s son Hayam
Wurook

The edifice rose from a square base and large statues of Siva as Kala
adorn the feet of the staircases which lead to the first and second
terrace  Of the temple proper not a stone is left  the walls of pit and
terraces are covered with sculpture  a sort of griffins on the highest
scenes from the  Ramayana  and illustrations of other popular poems and
fables on the lower ones  beautiful work but irreparably damaged by
official bungling  As if the apathy which suffered this noble monument
to be despoiled and the providentially undemolished parts to crumble
away  had not done enough harm  an amateur invested with local authority
conceived a plan of restoration and preservation on official lines
that beat even the methods of the art connoisseurs of the chain gang
to whom the care for the antiquities at Jogjakarta is entrusted
which would make reconstruction impossible for all time to come and
deface the ornament in the thoroughest possible way  In obedience to a
Government resolution of June 22  1900  Nr  18  the Batavian Society
of Arts and Sciences having been consulted with a view to save the
chandi  Panataran from further decay  the ContrÃ´leur in charge of the
administrative division within whose boundaries it is situated  engaged
native masons who  following their instructions  cemented  plastered and
whitewashed to the tune of fl  989 10  about  82  with the magnificent
result that the upper terrace has been transformed into a thickly
plastered reception bower for picnic parties  that everything has
received a neat coat of whitewash to rejoice the hearts of housewives
out for the day with their husbands  little family and friends  that the
architectural detail has been hidden under solid layers of mortar and
cement  Plaster  whitewash and cement everywhere  the noses and other
extremities of the scanty statuary still in place but injured by time
and hand of man  have been touched up with it  from top to bottom it
has been smeared over whatever could be reached  making the venerable
old temple hideously ridiculous  an orgy of  conservation  in the
pernicious official acceptance of the word  hoary age being ravaged by
cheap  destructive  tidying up   This is how the theory of Government
solicitude for the ancient monuments of Java works out in practice

It must be considered a miracle or evidence of the native masons
possessing a higher developed artistic sense than their employer  that
the bas reliefs have suffered less than this extraordinary process of
restoration and preservation portended  though much detail has been
destroyed  thanks to their vandalism under orders from Batavia as
understood by the Philistine of Blitar  In the first place we find
again  divided by medallions with representations of animal life  a
sculptural delineation of the  Ramayana   the artist s buoyant fancy
blending the celestial with the human  shedding a divine light on acts
of most common daily occurrence by making gods and semi gods partake
of man s estate in deeds sublimely natural  The  Ramayana  was a great
favourite for the decoration of temples  as proved by the  chandis
Panataran  Toompang  Surawana and Prambanan  the  Mahabharata  or
rather  its Javanese version  the  Brata Yuda   came as a good second
the  Arjuno Wiwaha  of the poet Mpu Kanwa has been put to use for the
embellishment of the  chandis  Surawana and Toompang  the  Kersnayana
for that of the  chandis  Toompang and Panataran  We might do worse and
in fact  we are doing worse with our insipid epitaphs and tasteless
lapidary pomposity in our cemeteries  than adorn the tombs of our great
departed with imagery taken from our poets  tellers of good tales and
fabulists  the life they knew so well aiding us to fathom death with
its mysteries and promises  The promise most cherished by the Hindu
Javanese was that personified in Siva  death to make new life grow and
increase in beauty among mortals feeding on happiness  by reason of
Kala s breath destroying the misery of tottering old age  raising man to
equality with the gods  That is what the people  for whom the marvellous
ancient monuments of Java were built  loved to read in the masterpieces
of their literature  carved for their benefit on the mausoleums of their
kings  heeding the wise lessons for whoso chooses to reflect  of their
Canterbury Tales    Faerie Queene    Paradise Lost  and  Paradise
Regained   their  Narrenschiff    Dil Ulenspigel  and  Faust   their
Divina Commedia  and  Decameron   their  Romancero del Cid  and  Conde
Lucanor   their  nouvelles  and  joyeux devis   their  vies trÃ¨s
horrifiques  of their Gargantuas and Pantagruels  Life in their thought
being intimately connected with death  which consequently inspired
nothing of the abject terror the practice of western Christianity
clothes it with  in curious contrast to the saving hope of its eastern
origin  we discern cheerfulness  the effect of serene meditation  the
true  amrita   the rejuvenating nectar of self existent immortality
as the keynote also to sensible earthly existence in the infinitely
varied forms inviting our examination on the walls of the  chandi
Panataran   Greift nur hinein ins volle Menschenleben   If the beholder
be a philosopher or an artist  or both  desirous to grasp the full life
of man  he will receive rare instruction  and if a  lustige Person  as
well  joy will accrue to him from the sempiternal relevancy of Javanese
allegorical humour  at times almost prophetic  the sculptor of the
pigheaded but self satisfied peasant who cultivates his land with a
plow drawn by crabs  99  must have had a vision of the Dutch Government
endeavouring  after periodical visitations of worse than customary want
misery and famine  to secure progress and prosperity in the island by
appointing long commissions with long names  toiling long years over
long reports that leave matters exactly where they were

The skies in the scenery of the bas reliefs on the lowest terrace of
the  chandi  Panataran have something very peculiar  termed cloud faces
by Dr  Brandes  who recognised in the fantastic forms of the floating
vapour as reproduced in the hard stone  demons and animals to which he
drew special attention  a  kala  head  a furious elephant threatening
to charge  etc  The figures of all bas reliefs  mostly perhaps those of
the second tier from below  are notable for their departure from the
smooth treatment generally accorded to Javanese sculpture of the period
and best defined perhaps in the phrase of one of Canova s critics when
he derided that artist s  peeled radish  style  Angular and flat  they
remind one of the  wayang  puppets  and the obvious correspondence
between the manner in which the  chandi  Panataran illustrates some
of the chief productions of Javanese literature and the performances
of the Javanese national theatre  has been cleverly insisted upon by
Rouffaer  The  wayang    i e   the dramatic art of the island  sprang
probably from religious observances of pre Hindu origin  Dr  G  A
J  Hazeu 100  is of opinion that it formed part of the ritual of the
ancient faith  and even now the  hadat  requires a sacrifice  the
burning of incense  etc   before the play commences  The Javanese word
lakon   a derivation from  laku   which signifies both  to run  and  to
act   applied to stage composition  is the exact etymological equivalent
of our  drama   the  lakon yÃ¨yÃ¨r    layer  or  lugu   confines itself
to tradition  the  lakon karangan  to subjects taken from tradition but
freely handled  the  lakon sempalan  to episodes from works otherwise
unsuitable because of their length  The  wayang  appears  according to
means of interpretation  as  wayang poorwa  or  kulit   101   gedog
kelitik  or  karucil    golek    topeng    wong  and  bÃ¨bÃ¨r   of which
the  wayang poorwa  holds the oldest title to direct descent from the
ancestral habit of invocation of the spirits of the dead  The epithet
poorwa  has been derived from the  parwas  of the  Mahabharata
which  together with the  Ramayana  and similar sources  offered an
abundant supply of dramatic material  it is from the  wayang poorwa
that the Javanese people derive their notions of past events  as the
inhabitants of another island did theirs from their poet and playwright
Shakespeare s histories before eminent actor managers set to  improve
upon his work  mutilating him on his country s stage in the evolution
of a  fortunately more textual  interpretation  pointedly designated as
Shakespearian post impressionism

A  wayang poorwa  performance knows nothing of the showy accessories
devised by and for our histrions to hide poverty of mentality and
poorness of acting  futile attempts to make up in settings  properties
costumes and trappings  tailoring  millinery and disproportionate
finery what they lack in essentials  The performer sits under his lamp
behind a white  generally red bordered piece of cloth stretched over a
wooden frame on which he projects the figures  He speaks for them and
intersperses explanations and descriptions  directing the musicians with
his gavel of wood or horn  striking disks of copper or brass to intimate
alarums  excursions  etc  Formerly all the spectators were seated
before the screen  as they still are in West Java  Bali and Lombok  but
gradually the men  separating from the women and children  moved behind
so that in Central and East Java they see both the puppets and their
shadows  The  wayang gedog   much less popular than the  wayang poorwa
evolved from it in the days of Mojopahit as Dr  L  Serrurier informs us
while the latter draws its repertory principally from Indian epics  the
former with Raden Panji  Prince of Jenggala  for leading hero  is more
exclusively Javanese and prefers the low metallic music of the  gamelan
pelog  102  to that of the  gamelan salendro  102  with its high notes
as of ringing glass  In the  wayang kelitik  or  karucil   of later
invention and never of a religious character  the puppets themselves are
shown  since  wayang  means  shadow   the use of that word is here  for
that reason  less correct  and the same applies to the  wayang golek
in which the marionettes lose their spare dimensions and become stout
and podgy  to the  wayang topeng  103  and  wong  104  in which living
actors perform  an innovation not countenanced by the orthodox  who
are afraid that such deviations from the  hadat  may result in dread
calamities  and to the  wayang bÃ¨bÃ¨r  which consists in displaying the
scenes otherwise enacted  in the form of pictures  Every one finds
in the  wayang   of whatever description  an echo of his innermost
self  the high born  smarting under a foreign yoke  in the  penantang
challenge and defiance   the lowly in the  banolan   farce   the fair
ones of all classes in the  prenesan   sentimental  gushing  spoony
speech   It is a treat to look at the natives  squatted motionless for
hours and hours together  their eyes riveted on the screen  listening
to the voice of the invisible performer  marvelling at the adventures
of the men and women who peopled the  negri jawa  before them and
faded into nothingness  even the mightiest among them  whose mausolea
at Prambanan  Toompang  Panataran  bear witness to the truth of those
amazing deeds of derring do  love and hate  which will remain the wonder
of the world  To them the phantom shadows are reality of happiness in a
dull  vexatious life which is but the veil of death

From Java  says Dr  Juynboll  the  wayang poorwa  was transplanted to
Bali  where it is still called  wayang parwa  and the puppets present
a more human appearance  Beside it thrives  especially in Karang Asam
the  wayang sasak   introduced from Lombok and more Muhammadan in
character  whose puppets have longer necks after the later Javanese
fashion  Apart from such influences  Balinese art  however  does not
disown its Hindu Javanese origin  The inhabitants of the island  with
the exception of the  Bali aga   the aborigines in the mountains
different in many respects  pride themselves on the name of  wong   men
of  Mojopahit and adhere to the Brahman religion  though here and there
a few Buddhists may be encountered  They are divided into castes and
SivaÃ¯te rites play an important part in the religious ceremonial of the
upper classes  The common people have adopted a sort of pantheism which
makes them sacrifice in the family circle to benevolent and malevolent
spirits of land and water  domiciled in the sea  rivers  hills  valleys
cemeteries  etc  The village temples are more specifically resorted to
for propitiation of the  jero taktu   a superior being entrusted with
the guidance of commercial affairs and best approached through the
guardian of his shrine  who is held in greater respect than the real
priests  Every village has also a house of the dead  consecrated to
Doorga  a goddess in high repute with those desirous to dispel illness
to secure a favourable issue of some enterprise  to learn the trend of
coming events  the heavenly lady enjoys in Bali a far wider  renommÃ©e
than her lord and master Siva  who is honoured in six comparatively
little frequented temples  As to the decadent architecture and excessive
ornamentation 105  of the Balinese houses of worship  Dr  Brandes
considers both the one and the other a direct outcome of the decay of
the eastern Javanese style  exemplified in the  chandis  Kedaton  1292
Machan Puti  106  Surawana and Tegawangi  The leading ideas of the
chandi bentar  or entrance gate  and of the  paduraksa  or middle gate
adduces Rouffaer  are related respectively to those of the gate Wringin
Lawang at Mojopahit and of what the present day Javanese call  gapura
in sacred edifices as old  kratons   old burial grounds  etc   and to
those of the gate Bajang Ratu  also at Mojopahit  These gates Wringin
Lawang and Bajang Ratu  states the same authority further  can teach us
moreover a few things anent the architecture of the  puris   palaces
The temples and princely dwellings of Mataram in Lombok were completely
destroyed during the inglorious war of 1894  the country seat of
Narmada  however  a fine specimen of an eastern pleasance  has escaped
demolition  For how long

In this respect it seems relevant to point to the circumstance that the
monuments of the smaller Soonda islands  much more conveniently placed
for the unscrupulous spoiler because under less constant observation
of the general public  are exposed to even greater danger than those
in Java  Government supervision counting for worse than nothing  A
Batavia paper denounced quite recently a traveller who had been visiting
the Dutch East Indies and  armed with letters of recommendation from
personages of the highest rank and title in the Netherlands  had been
collecting curiosa and antiquities on a vast scale only to advertise his
collection for sale as soon as unpacked after his return to Europe  It
contained carved ornament from temples  sacrificial vessels and statuary
from Bali  besides woven goods  implements used in  batikking   musical
instruments   wayang  puppets  etc  The profit attached to this sort of
globe trotting is enormous  since the coveted objects can be acquired
for a mere song by taking advantage of the influential assistance
secured through letters of recommendation over high sounding names
A hint from those in authority goes a very long way with the docile
native  in fact goes the whole way of appropriation at a nominal value
and the big official who left his post in the exterior possessions
bound for home  also quite recently  with fifty boxes of antique ware of
a different kind  collected in his residency  made certainly as good a
haul as the distinguished  brilliantly recommended tourist

CHAPTER VII

BUDDHIST JAVA

   Was ist das Heiligste  Das was heut  und ewig die Geister
   Tief und tiefer gefÃ¼hlt  immer nur einiger macht  107

   WOLFGANG VON GOETHE   Vier Jahreszeiten  Herbst


Although the theory of Gautama the Sugata s life story being only a
repolished solar myth has broken down  its vital element of emancipation
from Brahmanic bonds is certainly much older than Buddhism and the
traditional Buddha but an incarnation of ideas long germinating and
attaining fruition in his teachings  precisely as happened with other
religious reformers who came and went before and after  The thirty three
gods of the three worlds   eleven in heaven  eleven on earth and eleven
dwelling in glory in mid air   with their three supreme shining ones
Brahma  Vishnu and Siva  creating  maintaining  destroying and creating
anew  began to pall on the human  trimoorti  of brain  heart and
bodily wants  the moral dispensation on which the social edifice was
founded  began to need revision  Neither did the orthodox  at first
refuse admittance to the spirit of emendation  At the  sangharama  108
of Nalanda the Vedas were taught together with the Buddhist doctrine
according to the tenets of the Greater and the Lesser Vehicle  Ã  choix
The Buddha had to be accepted and was accepted equally by eastern
tolerance and western necessity  while ranking as a divine teacher among
his followers in the legendary development of his precepts  he received
honour as an incarnation of Vishnu among the Hindus  says Sir William
W  Hunter  109  and as a Saint of the Christian Church  with a day
assigned to him in both the Greek and Roman calendars  Truly  the Hindus
regarded him as the ninth and hitherto last incarnation of Vishnu  the
Lying Spirit let loose to deceive man until the tenth and final descent
of the god  on the white horse  with a flaming sword like a comet in
his hand  for the destruction of the wicked and the renovation of the
world  but he was reckoned with and acknowledged in their mythology
and the remarkable conformity between Prince Sarvarthasiddha s lineage
adventures and achievements  and those of the seventh  avatar  of the
Hindu deity in the  Ramayana  are certainly more than accidental  The
law of mercy to all  preached by the blissful Bhagavat  the Buddha  the
Saviour  affected the Brahman creed profoundly  so profoundly in its
deductions  that apprehensive priests resolved to extirpate Buddhist
heresy  But since religious persecution always defeats its purpose
Buddhism throve with oppression and holds fully its own against the two
other great religions of the present day  al IslÄm and Christianity

To define the Buddhism which  parallel and entwined with HinduÃ¯sm
preceded the Muhammadanism of Java  is no easy matter  if it is possible
at all  For the sake of convenience Javanese Buddhism may be classified
as  mahayanistic   conformable to the northern canon or doctrine of
the Greater Vehicle  versus  hinayanistic    i e   conformable to
the southern canon or the doctrine of the Lesser Vehicle  But the
geographical division proposed by Burnouf  hardly meets the case of
our more advanced knowledge  which points rather to chronological
distinctions  Javanese Buddhism of the younger growth was strongly
impregnated with modified Brahmanic conceits  110  in fact a compromise
between the hopeful expectation of the Metteya Buddha  the Messiah
promised by Bhagavat  and resignation to the decrees of the Jagad Guru
whom the Saivas of Hindu Java had chosen for their  ishta devata
the fittest form in which to adore the Ruler of the Universe  Param
Esvara  Siva lost under Buddhist influences his terrorising aspect as
Kala  and the two creeds  giving and taking  lived in perfect concord
The statues of the Dhyani Buddhas partook of Siva s attributes  those
of their sons  the Bodhisatvas  the Buddhas in evolution  and of their
saktis   showed the characteristics of other Hindu gods and goddesses
Siva  conversely  assumed the features of Avalokitesvara or Padmapani
the Buddhist lord of the world that is now  I have already spoken of the
enthroned Bodhisatvas represented at the SivaÃ¯te temples of Prambanan
and the more or less SivaÃ¯te exterior of the Buddhist  chandi  Mendoot
Also of this remarkable syncretism  born from inbred tolerance  leading
to new transactions with the IslÄm  exacting as it may be everywhere
else  of the deference still shown to deities of the Hindu pantheon
in the shape of  jinn   of the adjustment of Muhammadan institutions
to usages of Hindu origin  etc  And Buddhism  doubtless  prepared the
mystically inclined mind of the Javanese Moslim for the acceptance of
the mild Sufism of the school of Gazali  which guides him in submission
of will to  ma ripat   full knowledge  and  hakakat   most hidden truth
while he lacks the conviction  to quote Professor L  W  C  van den Berg
that his neglect of the prescribed daily prayers will make him lose his
status as a true believer

Central Java is richer yet in the quality than in the quantity of its
Buddhist monuments  whose builders and decorators  like the true
artists they were  told what they knew and believed  nothing but that
and therefore told it so well  111  To examine their work  beautiful
even in decay  beginning with the smaller structures  we wend our way
again to the plain of Prambanan  Travelling from Jogjakarta to Surakarta
by rail  the first stopping place  reached in about twenty minutes  is
Kalasan  the  chandi  of that name  otherwise called Kali Bening  being
visible from the train  Once it must have been one of the finest and
most elaborately wrought in the island  now only the south front  nearly
tumbling down  witnesses to its former splendour  It was built in 700
Saka  A D  778   a date preserved in a Nagari inscription which
settles that point  112  and names a Shailandra prince as its founder in
honour of his  guru   teacher   doing homage to Tara 113  who  seeing
the destruction of men in the sea of life  which is full of incalculable
misery  saves them by three means      it speaks of a grant of land to
the monks of a neighbouring monastery  contains several particulars of
practical value with an admonition to keep a bridge or dam in repair
etc  The building  in the form of a Greek cross  had four apartments
reached by a terrace and four staircases  the stones of which have been
carried away long ago  The four gates  judging by the little left on
one of them  were profusely decorated with the  kala makara  motive
dominating the ornament  The roof bore images of Dhyani Buddhas in 44
niches and was crowned with 16 dagobs so called  the principal one
rising probably to a great height  Time and rapine have reduced this
magnificent realisation of a glorious conception  this masterpiece of
measured luxury  as Rouffaer styles it justly  to a melancholy heap of
debris  The statuary which adorned the exterior is gone  save three
images in their niches  examples of the gorgeous but never too florid
ornamentation  the interior pictures desolation  ruin within ruin  A
disfigured elephant  driven by a horned monster  its mahout  protrudes
from the wall above the throne it protects  but the cushioned seat is
empty  The statue taken from it was presumably a representation of the
beatific Tara glorified in the inscription  the noble and venerable
one  whose smile made the sun to shine and whose frown made darkness to
envelop the terrestrial sphere  It has been surmised that the mysterious
female deity in the residency grounds at Jogjakarta originally filled
the throne of Kalasan  but the vanished Tara left her cushion behind
and the unknown goddess  whose lovely body rivals the lotus flower in
august sweetness  holds firmly to her  padmasana  in addition to her
attributes defying identification as the mother of the Buddha who is to
be

The short distance between the  chandi  Kalasan or Kali Bening and the
chandi  Sari must have been often traversed by the seekers of the
noble eight fold path  inquirers into the four truths and examiners
of the three signs  mortifiers of their flesh in the practice of the
ten repugnances   Bikshus   living on the alms they collected without
asking by word or gesture  without unduly attracting attention  passing
in silence those inclined and those not inclined to charity  avoiding
the houses and people dangerous to virtue  never tarrying anywhere and
never presenting themselves more than three times at the doors of the
uncharitable  eating the food received in solitude before noon  the only
meal allowed to them  they must have awakened a good deal of pity in
their tattered robes  but one suspects that the mendicant brethren of
Java  notwithstanding their individual vows of poverty  were exceedingly
wealthy as a community after the wont of their kind everywhere and of
whatever religious denomination  Their  viharas  or monasteries  to
judge from the ruins  were well appointed and the inmates apparently
well provided for by princes who took a pride or found their interest
in befriending religion and the religious  If strictly adhering to
their monastic rules  the Buddhist monks had to live in the open
but the wet monsoon is not a pleasant season in the woods without
adequate protection against storm and rain  and  avec le ciel il y a
des accommodements   a motto acted upon long before le Sieur Poquelin
formulated it  The  chandi  Sari is supposed to have been the main
structure of the residential quarter destined for the accommodation
of the clergy connected with the  chandi  Kalasan  the abode of the
monks who knew the greater vehicle of discipline as the inscription has
it  the monastery built by command of the Shailendra king for their
venerable congregation and recommended to his successors in order
that all who followed their teachings might understand the cause and
effect of the positive condition of things and attain prosperity  The
rectangular building had a lower and an upper storey  both divided
into three rooms  lighted by windows  the absent roof had niches for
statuary  capped with diminutive domes in the manner of dagobs  In the
decoration extensive use has been made of the elephant and the  makara
the fabulous fish with an elephant s head  images of saints with and
without aureoles  of celestial beings more suggestive of the Hindu
pantheon than of Buddhist atheism  114  of the bird people and divers
animals  enliven the rich  flowery ornament of the well proportioned
facings  cornices and window frames  Rising gracefully from its solid
yet elegant base  the edifice creates an impression of airiness and
stability cleverly combined  the dark gray colour of the weatherbeaten
andesite blending harmoniously with the tender green of the bambu stools
which transport our thoughts to the garden of Kalandra where the Buddha
preaching the lotus of the good law  made converts foreordained to rank
among his most famous disciples  Sariputra  Maudgalyayana  Katyayana
And the officially licensed sinners against the ancient monuments of
Java  hardened  habitual criminals in that respect  expressly appointed
to do their worst at the Paris Exhibition of 1900  pretended their
horrid botch in the Park of the TrocadÃ©ro to be a reproduction  d une
puretÃ© irrÃ©prochable  of this rare gem of architectural workmanship  the
chandi  Sari

C  Nieuwenhuis

As in India  pious foundations for the benefit of those under bond to
serve religion  disregarding worldly considerations  must have been
numerous in Java  especially in the plain of Prambanan  once studded
with  viharas  like Asoka s kingdom  the  Behar  of to day  Passing
over the monastic claims advanced for some ruins in the southern
mountains  those of Plahosan cannot be ignored  There we find the
remains of two buildings  formerly enclosed by a wall  portions of
which are recognisable  and surrounded by smaller structures arranged
in three rows  the inner ones reminding of the style conspicuous in the
chandi  Sewu  about a mile to the west southwest  Close together
but originally perhaps divided by a second wall  they are situated
due north and south from each other with their entrances to the west
the roofs have succumbed  of the two storeys only the lower ones
containing sufficient space for three rooms  are tolerably preserved
Of a composite nature  the  chandi  Plahosan was presumably rather a
sangharama  than a  vihara  and the doorkeeper at the gate  when all
those scattered stones and the smashed  stolen or otherwise removed
statues were still in place  may have welcomed the wayfarer  seeking
shelter on a tempestuous night  with such difficult questions as barred
access to the hospitality of Silabhadra  the superior of Nalanda  and
his flock  Hiuen Tsiang  the Chinese pilgrim  who could answer them all
and a good many more  has left us a description of the  sangharama
the six consolidated  viharas  of Nalanda with their towers  domes and
pavilions  embellished by the piety of the kings of the five Indies
their gardens  splashing fountains and shady groves  where he spent
several years learning Sanskrit and the wisdom of the holy books  never
thinking the days too long  their life of ease  scarcely conducive
to the austere observance of pristine discipline by the ten thousand
brethren under vows and novices who crowded thither to seek purification
and deliverance from sin in study and meditation   a description which
for want of any better  our fancy takes leave to apply to Plahosan
Though separated by months of travel from Bodhimanda  where Sakyamuni
entered the state of the perfect Buddha and the proximity of which
gave Nalanda its holy character  the zeal of its scholars and saints
no less tolerant than Hiuen Tsiang s temporary co students  who sifted
with laudable impartiality the truth from the Vedas  from the doctrines
of the two vehicles and from the heresies of the eighteen schismatics
undoubtedly stimulated religious life in the best sense of the word
religion disposing the mind to kindliness and goodwill  as it should
strengthening social ties  fostering science and art

The walls of the  chandi  Plahosan  in so far as preserved  are
beautifully decorated with sculpture in bas relief  The delicate
tracery of the basement is divided by slender pilasters and the frieze
beneath the symmetric cornice is richly festooned  parrots nestling in
the foliage among the flowers  Bodhisatvas  standing between  formed
the principal ornament of panels bordered by garlands with pendent
prayer bells  the remaining ones grasp lotus stems springing up to their
left   gandharvas   celestial singers  float over the  garuda  heads of
the portals  The reliefs represent scenes familiar to the observer of
native life  here a couple of men seated under a bo tree or  waringin
and saluting a person of rank  raising their folded hands to perform
the  sembah   there a  mÄs  115  with his attendants  one of whom
holds the  payoong   sunshade  over his head while another carries
a  senteh  116  leaf  Four stone figures guard the approaches to the
viharas   armed with cudgel and sword  in one hand they hold the snake
which  after the manner of their kind  should be worn over one shoulder
and across the breast  replacing the  upawita   The statuary which
adorned the inner rooms  was of large dimensions  finely chiselled and
garnished with profuse detail  concluding from what we know of it  Part
has been removed to the  museum  at Jogja  part has been broken to
pieces by treasure hunters who dug holes and sunk shafts  disturbing
the foundations of the  chandi  Plahosan in their ignorance of the
difference between Buddhist monasteries and Hindu mausolea built round
funeral pits  the sorely damaged images of holiness which were suffered
to keep their stations by frankly destructive and even more pernicious
official or semi official  soi disant   preservation and conservation
are truly pitiful to behold  It seems  indeed  as if the monuments
specially recommended to official care  are singled out for the most
irreparable injury  On a par with the wild feast of plaster  cement
and whitewash at Panataran was the wonderful planning of a restoration
of the  chandi  Plahosan after faulty drawings and the simultaneous
disappearance of the staircase and a portion of the substructure of the
northern  vihara

Less than a mile to the south of the stopping place Prambanan on the
railroad from Jogja to Solo  are the ruins of a group of  chandis
which may or may not have borne a monastic character  117  Sajiwan and
Kalongan being the names connected with it  One of the structures was
cleared in 1893 by the Archaeological Society of Jogjakarta and to its
statuary applies what has been said of the atrocities perpetrated at
Plahosan  besides downright spoliation the same errors of omission and
commission  From Prambanan proper   i e   from the Loro Jonggrang group
it is a short walk to the  chandi  Sewu  which means the  thousand
temples   They are situated in Surakarta  the boundary between the
Susuhunan s and the Sooltan s domains  indicated by two white pillars
running just behind the smaller structures which face the shrines of
Brahma and Vishnu flanking that of Siva  But  though the walk is short
it may be a trifle too sunny for comfort even if it be morning and the
roads lively with the women returning from market  the surroundings
of the houses of prayer and death gladdening the eye  presenting a
spectacle full of colour and light  the matrons treading their way
statelily and steadily  the maidens  decorous and modest  gliding behind
their elders like the  devis   the shining ones descended from the
Ramayana  reliefs  to exhibit their exquisite forms  bashful however
conscious of their worth in that golden  sweet scented atmosphere
They have no business at the  chandi  Sewu and on the unfrequented
by path thither we proceed alone  save for a few children with no more
to cover their nakedness than the loveliest innocence  a garment quite
different from the western  cache misÃ¨re  of mawkish prudery    curious
to find out what the strangers are about  Under their escort we reach
the  chandi  Loomboong   padi  shed   thus called from the size and form
of the ruins which compose it  They are sixteen in number  arranged in
a square round the principal structure  its once octagonal roof  shaped
like a dagob  attesting to its Buddhist character  though it is not
unmixed with SivaÃ¯te elements as the funeral pits plainly indicate  They
were already empty when examined some years ago and the fine statues
tradition speaks of  can nowhere be found  The little ornament left in
place and one single fragment of a bas relief give a high idea of the
decoration when the beauty of these temples had not yet faded away
exactly as in the case of the  chandi  Bubrah  118  another shrine on
the  via sacra  which connects the Loro Jonggrang and Sewu groups  To
quote Major van Erp again  The state of affairs here is very sad  of the
chandis  Ngaglik  Watu Gudik and Geblak  which the memory of the oldest
inhabitants puts somewhat farther north  even the site cannot now be
located

Illustration  XXI   RAKSASA  OF THE  CHANDI  SEWU

Centrum

By the time we reach the thousand temples  Surya  the sun god  has
driven his fiery carriage to the zenith of his daily course through
the air and the fire eyed  raksasas   who guard the enclosure of
holiness  two for each of the four entrances  stretch their gigantic
limbs with dreadful menace in the warm brilliancy of indefinite space
tangible terror  Down on one knee to strike  snakes hanging from their
left shoulders as poisonous baldrics  they seem to mark the transition
between the worship of Kala  quickening destruction personified  and
the creed which hails in death the portal to nirvanic nothingness
the liberation from life s miseries  Behind them reigns the stillness
of a tropical noon  subduing heaven and earth to silent but intensely
passionate day dreams  The kingly sun  the sun of Java  wide skirted
Jagannath  having mounted to the summit of the fleckless sky  pauses
a moment before descending  he  the light of the world  exciting to
generative emotion all that dwells below  The fructifying charm of his
touch is manifest in the exuberant fertility of this island fortunate
in the vitality of its people  unrestrained in creative capacity by
centuries of spoliation  in their mental make up  revealed in their
history  their beliefs  traditions and legends  The legend of the
chandi  Sewu may be adduced as an instance in point  though nothing
but a different version of the legend of the  chandi  Loro Jonggrang
One ancient effort to account for architectural wonders deemed of
supernatural origin  by an explanation whose Indian basic idea was
transplanted from the fields of eastern to those of western folk lore
too  serving at first  perhaps  for all the monuments in the plains
of Prambanan and Soro Gedoog  became the framework of different tales
adapted to the requirements of different localities  Here it is the
story of Mboq Loro Jonggrang repeated  and her lover Raden Bandoong
Bondowoso is the son of the beautiful Devi Darma Wati  daughter of Prabu
Darmo Moyo  king of the mighty empire of Pengging  whose two brothers
Prabu Darmo Haji and Prabu Darmo Noto  were kings respectively of
Slembri and Sudhimoro

The  babad chandi Sewu  describes a public function at the Court of
Prabu Darmo Moyo  who sits on his throne of ivory  inlaid with the
rarest gems  The  aloon aloon  outside swarms with his warriors and
while he pronounces judgment and invests and displaces  ambassadors from
Prambanan are announced  They deliver a letter from Prabu Karoong Kolo
in which the Boko  the giant king  asks Prabu Darmo Moyo s daughter
Devi Darma Wati  in marriage  The Princess  acquainted with his suit
declares that she will marry no one but the man  be he king or beggar
able to rede a riddle which is given  written on a  lontar  leaf  to
the ambassadors who thereupon depart  On their arrival at Prambanan
Prabu Karoong Kolo breaks impatiently the seal of the communication
learning its meaning  his eyes dart flames  his mouth foams and
tearing the  lontar  leaf into pieces and trampling upon it  making the
earth tremble and disturbing the sky with his noisy wrath  he collects
his army and marches against Pengging to raze the  kraton  of Prabu
Darmo Moyo and carry Darma Wati off  The King of Pengging  warned
of the approaching danger  implores his brother Darmo Noto  King of
Sudhimoro  to assist him  with his brother Darmo Haji  King of Slembri
an odious tyrant  he has broken long ago  Prabu Darmo Noto orders his
son  the Crown Prince Raden Damar Moyo  to lead his troops against the
giant king  Traversing the woods at the head of his men  scaling cliffs
and climbing mountains  crossing rivers and ravines  attacked by evil
spirits and wild animals  Damar Moyo  strenuous in the cause of his
uncle and his fair cousin  hastens to their defence but  leaving every
one behind  he loses his way and  tired out at last  falls asleep  A
strange sensation of heavenly joy awakens him and  opening his eyes
he beholds the supreme god  Bathara Naradha  who presents him with the
celestial weapons of the abode of the immortals  Jonggring Saloko
salves his forehead with the divine spittle to make him invulnerable and
invincible  and puts into his hand the flower Sekar Joyo Kusumo which
will enable him to rede Devi Darma Wati s riddle  Strengthened and more
enthusiastic than ever  Raden Damar Moyo  having rejoined his army
engages the giants of Prambanan and defeats them  astonishing friend and
foe with his acts of superhuman prowess  He redes the riddle  marries
Darma Wati  and his father in law  Prabu Darmo Moyo  appoints him
senapati    i e   commander in chief of the forces of Pengging

The legend being too long for insertion in full  besides its containing
details too candidly illustrative of the generative emotion engendered
by the wide skirted Jagannath  a summary of the events which led to the
foundation of the  chandi  Sewu must suffice  Boko Prabu Karoong Kolo
King of Prambanan  loses his life in another attempt at the subjugation
of Pengging  and Raden Damar Moyo  having nothing more to fear from
that side  but naturally inclined to strife and contest  resolves to
take part in the wars then raging among the kings of the Thousand
Empires  Sewu Negoro  So he leaves his wife and the son born to them
Raden Bandoong  who grows into a comely youth  Arriving at manhood and
still in complete ignorance of his sire s name and lineage  the prince
questions his mother on that subject but  in obedience to an express
order from the gods  she refuses to tell him  Vexed and suspicious  he
equips himself from the armoury of his grandfather  Prabu Darmo Moyo
and eludes maternal vigilance  escaping from the  kraton  in search of
his father  After many adventures  culminating in a conflict with his
parent in the Sewu Negoro  the two meeting and exchanging hard blows and
parting as strangers  he reaches Prambanan  kills Tumenggoong Bondowoso
left in charge of that realm  and falls in love with Devi Loro
Jonggrang  daughter of the late Boko Prabu Karoong Kolo  But he has been
forestalled in her favour by his cousin Raden Boko  who is to become
her husband on condition of the overthrow of Pengging and Sudhimoro
Suspecting a rival while maturing his plans for conquest  this Raden
Boko takes a mean advantage of the lady by a trick learnt from a recluse
who lends him a  tesbeh   string of prayer beads  which possesses the
power of transforming its temporary owner into a white turtle dove
So disguised  he flies to the women s quarter of the  kraton  of
Prambanan and attracts the attention of Loro Jonggrang  who responds to
the lovely bird s advances  puts it in her bosom and pets and fondles
it to her heart s content until  alas  it is killed by an arrow sped
from the never erring bow of Raden Bandoong  thanks to the busybodies
of the palace having informed him of the idyllic progressive cooing
Woman like  the bereaved Devi submits to the inevitable after a period
of passionate mourning  and promises her heart and hand to the stronger
if not more dexterous suitor on condition of his building a thousand
temples in one night between the first crowing of the cock and daybreak
With the help of the gods of Jonggring Saloko he accomplishes the task
but at the moment that he whispers  astaga 119  chandi Sewu   struck by
the sight of the moonlit plain blossoming into a city of holiness  the
immortals change him for his arrogant prayer into a monster of horrible
aspect  Woman like again  the Devi declines to keep her promise
pleading that she engaged herself to a man and not to a brute  and seeks
refuge on the banks of the river Opak  Frightened by the persecution of
Raden Bandoong  who tracks her from cave to cave  she gives untimely
birth to a daughter  the fruit of her affection for turtle doves  and
dies  The brutal  baffled lover still haunts the neighbourhood  which
therefore native mothers to be scrupulously avoid  though it is not
observed that the virgins derive much instruction from the legend as far
as concerns the consequences of Devi or Mboq Loro Jonggrang s  amours
at an earlier stage

From legendary lore we return to fact in the matter of the foundation of
the  chandi  Sewu by taking cognisance of an inscription   mahaprattaya
sangra granting  or  sang rangga anting   unearthed near one of its
246  not thousand  temples  120  extolling the munificence of the
magnanimous Granting or Anting  The style of writing justifies the
conjecture that the buildings date from about the year 800 and are
consequently of one age with the Boro Budoor  If not erected by one
architect at the command of one bounteous prince  and the gifts of
several pious souls who possessed the wherewithal for devotional works
they were at least constructed according to one plan steadily kept in
view  a good deal more than can be said of many religious edifices in
western climes  which owe their existence less to co operative than to
contentious piety  In respect of area the largest of the temple groups
in Java  the first impression received from it is that of a chaos of
ruins  confusion being worse confounded by the quarries opened here
and there  and partly filled again with earth and rubbish  while a
luxuriant vegetation  regaining on the inroads of mattock and pickaxe
quickly covers what they disturbed  Looking closer  the separate
shrines with their elaborate tracery appear in the fiery embrace of
the sun like sparkling jewels  trembling with delight in the luminous
atmosphere beneath the immaculate sky  the very marks of decay and
ravaging time are beautiful  the weeds clustering round the broken
ornament  the toppling walls  rouse to fanciful thought  No sound is
heard  nothing stirs while we make our way to the principal structure
once lording it over the smaller ones which stood squarely in four
lines  28 for the inner  44 for the next  80 for the third  88 for
the outer circumvallation  Excepting those of the second row  their
entrances faced inward and amidst their scanty remains the foundations
have been uncovered of five somewhat larger ones  two to the east  two
to the west and one to the north  like the outlying buildings  these
are  with regard to their superstructures  as if they never existed  Of
the terraces and staircases no other trace is left than the telltale
unevenness of the ground  The resemblance in constructive methods
between the  chandi  Sewu and the  chandi  Prambanan strikes one at the
first glance  the same builders  it is surmised  strove here to do for
the Triratna 121  what there they did for the Trimoorti  and if not the
same  they discerned equally the one truth bound up in the old creed and
the new  and expressed it with equal skill and conviction in these twin
litanies of stone  so the workers wrought and the work was perfected by
them

The decorators in charge of the finishing touches  embellished this
city of temples with a wealth of ornament which in the quivering glare
of day  despite ravage of time and pillage  clothes sanctity in robes
of encrusted winsomeness  The sculpture of the  chandi  Sewu  says a
visitor of a century ago  is tasteful  delicate and chaste  Much of what
he based his judgment on  has since been carried off or demolished
but what remains fully bears him out  foliage and festoons  garlands
and clustered flowers  distributed over facings divided into lozenges
and circles by pilasters and fantastically curved lines  with lions
tigers  cattle and deer in ever varying abundance  awaken reminiscences
of the carvings which excited our admiration at Prambanan and lead
to the question  Did the richly framed panellings of the twenty four
external wall spaces of the central temple exhibit scenes from the
epics and fable books  besides this sumptuous adornment  to match the
almost uniform bas reliefs of the lesser structures  If so  they must
have rivalled the artistic excellence of the  Ramayana  reliefs which
beautify the shrines of Siva  Brahma and Vishnu  And a second question
arises  Was the central temple the depository of a relic  In connection
with this query it deserves to be noticed that  generally speaking
and excepting statuary  the internal wall spaces of the  chandi
Sewu lack ornament  evince a soberness in marked contrast to the
extravagant representations of the abode of bitterness  as if sign
or house painters had been entrusted with the illustration of Dante s
Inferno   repulsive attempts Ã  la Wiertz minus the talent to be admired
in the Rue Vautier at Brussels  nightmares of crude drawing and cruder
colouring to depict perverse torture  I found in eastern edifices raised
to satisfy priestly conventions  even in Ceylon  the island of the
doctrine that the Buddha next to dwell on earth is the Metteya Buddha
the Buddha of Kindness  More in harmony with the soul s yearning for his
kingdom to come  is the lotus motive happily adapted to the decoration
of the  chandi  Sewu  especially in one of the partially preserved small
temples of the outer file  to the east of the southern entrance  from a
strong stem which separates into three branches  on three of the sides
the entrance taking up the fourth  three lotus flowers spring from the
soil to carry  in a finely chiselled niche  the  vanished  image of the
expected one  the gone before and coming after  A few of the outlying
buildings have plain facings without any ornament at all  from which it
has been concluded that here too something happened to stop the labour
in progress  Where completed  the plump bellied flowerpot  a familiar
feature in Javanese ornament  enters largely into the decorative design
and its frequent repetition bestows on the sculpture of the  chandi

Archaeological Service through Charls and van Es

It has already been remarked that the interiors of the structures which
together form this group  are almost bare of decoration  The recesses
of the central temple  whose external ornament surpasses in luxuriance
everything met elsewhere in Java  three small interconnected apartments
projecting on the west  north and south  while the eastern front is
broken by the porch  have only empty niches 122  framed by pilasters
with flowery capitals  The inner chamber  no less soberly decorated and
stripped of the statuary it possessed   en nÃ©gligÃ©  as it were

    Belle sans ornement  dans le simple appareil
   D une beautÃ© qu on vient d arracher au sommeil

has on its western side a raised throne of ample dimensions  once
perhaps occupied by the large image without head and right hand  dug
out of the debris and carried off to the  museum  at Jogja  It still
awaits identification and the difficulty is increased by the impropriety
of speculating on the likelihood that representations of the universal
spirit were admitted in a temple built for the ritual of a creed which
acknowledges neither a god nor a soul aspiring to communion with the
divine essence in prayer  desiring nothing but annihilation  Yet the
Buddhists did learn to pray and to give transcendental ideas a tangible
expression in human shape  though they never sank to idolatry  And in
Java  mixing freely with Brahmanism  not impermeable to the Sankhya
doctrine  Buddhism seems to have swerved occasionally from its longings
for extermination in the Nirvana to entertain vague  confused notions
of something more hopeful  witness the oft repeated Banaspatis  Herein
lies  perhaps  the explanation of otherwise embarrassing peculiarities
observed in the conception  the attributes and attitudes of many
Buddhist statues in the island which  for the rest  are distinguished by
great simplicity of execution  So is the throne which extends over half
the floor of the inner room of the central temple of the  chandi  Sewu
and the same applies to the few headless Dhyani Buddhas lying round
sundered from their stations where they faced the cardinal points  the
four quarters of the world  and the first of them  the very elevated
facing the sky  A gigantic finger of bronze  found in the chapel of
the throne  supports the theory that the principal statue was of that
alloy  an additional incentive to plunder  ancient images of bronze have
become scarce indeed  the form of the cushioned pedestal in the  chandi
Kalasan too betokens a captured metallic Tara  to the further detriment
of the domiciliary rights there claimed for the homeless Lady of Mystery
in the residency grounds at Jogja

Although the bulky  raksasas  which keep her company in that place of
exile  prove that official vandalism did not hesitate to avail itself of
facilities of transportation afforded by forced labour  the uncommonly
heavy guardians of the  chandi  Sewu balked even the absolute decrees
of local despotism  Everything desirable that could be detached and
removed  is  however  gone  Those in authority having exercised their
privilege by helping themselves  mere private individuals gleaned after
their reaping  with or without permission  and exceedingly interesting
collections of antiquities were formed by owners of neighbouring
sugar mills  What they appropriated  did  at least  remain in the
country  but  among other sculpture  the lion fighting elephants which
lined the fourteen staircases  ten feet high and eight feet wide  still
in place as late as 1841  cannot even be traced  they are dissolved
battling animals  staircases and all  It is always and everywhere the
same story  statuary and ornament are stolen  treasure seekers smash
the rest  the stones are prime building material and who cares for
the preservation of worthless  because already looted and demolished
tumble down temples  The monuments in the plain of Soro Gedoog have
suffered exceptional outrages  at this moment hardly anything is left
because there exists absolutely no control  says Major van Erp  His
investigations disclosed that stones taken from the  chandi  Prambanan
and  when this was stopped  from the  chandi  Sewu  were used for the
building of a dam in the river Opak  Had not public opinion made itself
heard  both these temples might have shared the fate of the  chandi
Singo  once one of the finest in that region  whose gracefully decorated
walls excited the admiration of Brumund in 1845  whose substructure
with damaged ornament still held out until 1886  while now the
ground plan cannot even be guessed at and deep holes  dug to get at the
foundations  are the only indications of the razed building s site  To
give an idea of the quantity of material used for the dam in the river
Opak  I transcribe the measurements of its revetments  35 metres on the
left and from 50 to 60 metres on the right bank  the facings  running
up to a height of 6 metres  make it evident beyond doubt where the
stone for that work was quarried  Neither are we quite sure that such
frightful spoliation belongs wholly to the past  The value of Government
solicitude  so eloquently paraded in circulars and colonial reports
can be gauged from the fact  stated by Mr  L  Serrurier  that  during
officially sanctioned excavations among the ruins of the  chandis
Plahosan and Sewu  the stones brought to the surface were simply thrown
pell mell on a heap without their being marked as to locality and
position  quite in keeping  it should be added  with the prevailing
custom

This accounts for the sad desolation  more pitiful since  soi disant
archaeologists got their hands in  shone upon at the  chandi  Sewu as at
the  chandis  Plahosan  Sari  Kalasan  Panataran  to restrict myself to
one name from East Java   shone upon by the sun  the egg of the world
whose yolk holds the germ of creation  Surya  the solar orb personified
is a companion wonderfully  grandly suggestive among the  thousand
temples  of life accomplished  decaying into new birth  whether he
scorches the earth and withers the drooping flowers  or climbs a dim
hazy sky to attract the vapours that descend again in precious showers
when the clouds collect and cover the stars  charming from darkness the
lovely dawn and budding day  The meditations he disposes the mind to
are mostly directed to the future  dreams of coming happiness  and even
the contemplative Buddhist images under the Banaspatis seem agitated
by their knowledge of a promise excelling the hope of Nirvana  which
cannot satisfy the aspirations of the children of this island  full of
the joy of existence  What will the future bring to them  the people
cradled in tempest  who were taught forbearance by a creed profoundly
imbued with the inner nature of things  and submission when misery of
war and pestilence came as the harbingers of bondage to an alien race
Too trustful  they sacrificed their birthright for a mess of pottage
and after the encroachments of the Company  past ages crowding on their
memory  the felicity of the  jaman buda  assumes to their imagination a
tangible shape in the ancient monuments founded by the rulers of their
own flesh and blood  edifices so widely different from the meretricious
Government opium dens and Government pawn shops in which the predatory
instinct of the present masters manifests itself   layin dahulu  layin

relations  the Javanese philosopher  and all Javanese are philosophers
in their way  takes the practical view of the Vedantins  considering
that calamities mean purification to the victor in moral contest  and
looking for a serene morning after a night of distress  He has more
beliefs than one to draw upon when seeking refuge in his cherished
maxim  his phlegmatic  apa boleh buwat   124  and doubts not the
possibility of obtaining a Moslim equivalent for the Buddhist  arahat

a Hindu deity  Ganesa  who knows what is to happen and  as Vinayaka
the guide  conquers obstacles hurtful to his votaries in the course
of events preordained according to their IslÄmic doctrine  syncretism
yet more complex than that of their forefathers of Old Mataram
Watch well the heart  commanded the master  As to the watched heart
dominating the senses  the Javanese  rather a mystic than an ascetic
and predominantly a child of nature  whence he proceeds and whither he
returns in his search of the divine  prefers enjoyment of the world s
fullness to mortification of the flesh  He feels much more closely drawn
to Padmapani  the lord of the world that is  than to any other of the
emanations of the essence of the Universe  be it Diansh Pitar or the
One  the Eternal  who sent Muhammad as a mercy to all creatures  or the
Adi Buddha  the primitive  the primordial  the incarnate denial of god
and soul together  Whatever he prays by  the deity involved is one of
overflowing gladness  who presents a flower with each hand  like Surya
when circling land and sea and air in three steps  and  notwithstanding
his sorrows  he rests content with his portion for  though the light of
day sets  it will rise again in glory

CHAPTER VIII

THE APPROACH TO THE BORO BUDOOR

   The goodly works  and stones of rich assay
   Cast into sundry shapes by wondrous skill
   That like on earth no where I reckon may

   EDMUND SPENSER   Faerie Queene   Canto X


Among the ancient monuments of Insulinde 125  the  chandi  Boro
Budoor stands  facile princeps   Situated in the Kadu  it is easily
reached from Jogjakarta  about twenty five miles  or from Magelang
about eighteen miles distant  by carriage or  still more easily  by
taking the steam tram which connects those two provincial capitals and
leaving the cars at Moontilan where an enterprising Chinaman provides
vehicles  at short notice  for the rest of the journey via the  chandi
Mendoot on the left bank of the Ello  just above its confluence with
the Progo  No better approach to the most consummate achievement of
Buddhist architecture in the island or in the whole world  can be
imagined than this one  which leads past the smaller but scarcely less
nobly conceived and conscientiously executed temple  a commensurate
introduction to the wonderful  crowning edifice across the waters
portal to the holiest in gradation of majestic beauty  The Kadu has been
well styled the garden of Java  as Java the pleasance of the East  full
of natural charms which captivate the senses  abounding in amenities
soothing to body and soul  but if it had nothing more to offer than
the Boro Budoor and the Mendoot  it would reward the visitor to those
central shrines of Buddhism far beyond expectation

Behind the horses  a mental recapitulation of the characteristics of
Hindu and Buddhist architecture in the golden age of Javanese art
will not come amiss  and there may be some wonder that with so much
veneration for the Bhagavat in friendly competition with the Jagad
Guru  nowhere in the  negri Jawa  an imprint is shown of the blessed
foot of promise  with the deliverer s thirty first sign  the wheel of
the law on the sole  If  in explanation  it should be adduced that he
never travelled to those distant shores  what does that matter  Has he
been in Ceylon  And how then about the  sripada   the record left there
as in so many other countries  with the sixty five hints at good luck
While we revolve such questions  our carriage rolls on  the coachman
cracks his whip  evidently proud of his skill in turning sharp corners
without reining in  the runners jump with amazing agility off and on the
foot board and crack  their  whips  rush to the front to encourage the
leaders of the team up steep inclines  fall again to the rear when it
goes down hill in full gallop  The exhilarating motion makes the blood
tingle in the veins  How lovely the landscape  the valley shining in the
brilliant light reflected from the mountain slopes

Another turn and we dash like a whirlwind past the  kachang  oil 126
and  boongkil  127  mill of Mendoot  still another turn and  with a
magnificent display of his dexterity in pulling up  our Jehu brings us
to a sudden standstill before the temple  Opposite is a mission school
conducted for many years  with marked success  by Father P  J
Hoevenaars  in his leisure hours an ardent student of Java s history and
antiquities  ever ready to apply the vast amount of learning accumulated
in his comprehensive reading on a solid classical basis  to the clearing
up of disputed points  though his modesty suffered the honours of
discovery to go to the noisy players of the archaeological big drum  His
large stock of information was and is always at the disposal of whoever
may choose to avail himself of it and  writing of the  chandis  Mendoot
and Boro Budoor  I acknowledge gratefully the benefit derived from
my intercourse with this accomplished scholar  lately transferred to
Cheribon

The exact date of the birth of the  chandi  Mendoot is unknown but
there are reasons for believing that it was built shortly after the
chandi  Boro Budoor  at some time between 700 and 850 Saka  778 and 928
of the Christian era   in the glorious period of Javanese architecture
to which we owe also the Prambanan group  the  chandis  Kalasan  Sewu
and whatever is of the best in the island  There are additional reasons
for believing that the splendour loving prince who ordered the Boro
Budoor to be raised and under whose reign the work on that stupendous
monument was begun  founded the Mendoot too as a mausoleum to perpetuate
his memory  and that his ashes were deposited in the royal tomb of his
own designing before its completion  If so  he was one of the most
prolific and liberal builders we have cognisance of  but his memory
is nameless and all we know of him personally  besides the imposing
evidence to his Augustan disposition contained in the superb structures
he left  rests upon two pieces of sculpture at the entrance to the
inner chamber of the mortuary chapel  if such it be  which represent a
royal couple with a round dozen of children  just as we find in some
old western churches the carved or painted images of their founders
families  128  We are perhaps indebted for the preservation of these
suggestive reliefs to the circumstance of the  chandi  Mendoot having
been covered  hidden from view during centuries and to a certain extent
protected against sacrilegious hands by volcanic sand  earth and
vegetation  Almost forgotten  its slumbers were  however  not wholly
undisturbed for  when Resident Hartman  his curiosity being excited by
wild tales  began to clear it in 1836  he found that treasure seekers
out for plunder  had pierced the wall above the porch and that by way
of consolation or out of vexation at missing the untold wealth reported
to be buried inside  they had carried off or smashed the smaller  free
standing statuary  The process of cleaning up rather stimulated than
prevented new outrages  stripped of its covering of detritus  which
had shielded it at least against petty  casual pilfering  the  chandi
Mendoot excited by its helpless beauty the most injurious enthusiasm
Fortunately  the statues which formed its chief attraction were too big
for the attentions of the long fingered gentry whose peculiar methods in
dealing with native art strongly needed but never experienced repression
by the local authorities

Illustration  XXIII   CHANDI  MENDOOT BEFORE ITS RESTORATION

Cephas Sr

Speaking of the statuary and comparing it with Indian models  more
particularly a four armed image  seated cross legged on a lotus  the
stem of which is supported by two figures with seven headed snake hoods
Fergusson says  The curious part of the matter is  that the Mendoot
example is so very much more refined and perfect than that at Karli
The one seems the feeble effort of an expiring art  the Javan example
is as refined and elegant as anything in the best age of Indian
sculpture  Of the Mendoot carvings  however  more anon  I shall first
endeavour to give a general idea of this temple which  according to
the same writer  though small  is of extreme interest for the history
of Javanese architecture  Rouffaer calls it the classic model of a
central shrine with substructure and churchyard  while observing that
the principal statue of the Boro Budoor  the rest of whose statues
are turned either towards one of the cardinal points or towards the
zenith  faces the east and the Mendoot opens to the west  the two
temples therefore fronting each other  Closely observed  the latter
proved of double design since it consists of a stone outer sheath
built round an older structure of brick  the original form with its
panellings  horizontal and perpendicular projections  having been
scrupulously followed  The neatly fitting joints  both of the hewn
stones and of the bricks of the interior filling  show a mastery of
constructive detail rarely met with at the present day and certainly
not in Java  To this wonderful technique  adding solidity to a graceful
execution of the ground plan  belongs all the credit for the Mendoot
holding out  notwithstanding persistent ill usage  An ecstatic thought
brightly bodied forth by a daring imagination and astonishing skill
a charming act of devotion blossoming from the flower decked soil as
the lotus of the good law did from the garden of wisdom and universal
love  it must have looked grandly beautiful in its profuse ornament
which taught how to be precise without pettiness  how to attain the
utmost finish without sacrificing the ensemble to trivial elaboration
Yet this gem of Javanese architecture seemed destined to complete
destruction  Its pitiful decay did not touch the successors of Resident
Hartman  When  in 1895  after several years  absence from the island
I came to renew acquaintance  it had visibly crumbled away  official
interference with  collectors  limited itself to notices  stuck up on a
bambu fence  warning them of the danger they ran from the roof falling
in  It needed two years more of demolition  the walls bulging out  the
copings tumbling down  before the correspondence  opened in 1882 anent
a desirable restoration  produced some result  before the Mendoot  the
jewelled clasp of that string of pearls  the Buddhist  chandis  pendent
on the breast of Java from the Boro Budoor  her diamond tiara  was going
to be refitted

And how  It is an unpleasant tale to tell  after two decades of
consideration and reconsideration  in the fourth year of the preliminary
labours of restoration  the local representative of the Department of
Public Works  put in charge of the job as a side issue of his already
sufficiently exacting normal duties  aroused suspicions concerning his
competency in the archaeological line  An altercation with Dr  Brandes
followed by more controversy  de viva voce   in writing and in print
led to compliance with his request that it might please his superiors to
relieve him from his additional and subordinate task as reconstructor
of ancient monuments  From that moment  January 2  1901  until May 1
1908  absolutely nothing was done and the scaffoldings erected all round
the building were suffered to rot away  symbolic of the extravagant
impecuniosity of a Government which never cares how money is wasted but
always postpones needful and urgent improvements till the Greek Kalends
on the plea of its chronic state of  kurang wang   129  When most of
the fl  8600  fl  7235  fl  25142 and fl  4274  successively wrung from
Parliament for excavations and restoration  had been squandered on
what Dr  Brandes considered to be bungling patchwork  the expensive
useless scaffoldings  becoming dangerous to the passers by in their
neglected state  necessitated the disbursement  in 1906  of fl  350
for their removal  On the continuation of the work  in 1908  by other
hands  of course a new one  also of teak wood  had to be erected  And
the restoration once more being under way on the strength of fl  6800
grudgingly allotted  Parliament decided finally that no sufficient
cause had been shown to burden the colonial budget with the sum which
according to an estimate of 1910  was required to bring it to an end
The profligately penurious mandarins of an exchequer exhausted by
almost limitless liberality in the matter of high bounties  subsidies
allowances  grants for experiments which never lead to anything of
practical value  in the matter of schemes which cost millions and
millions only to prove their utter worthlessness   the penny wise
pound foolish heads refused  after an expenditure of fl  52401 to
little purpose  to disburse fl  21700 or even fl  7000 more for the
completion of the work commenced  this time under guarantee of success
Arguments advanced to make them revoke their decision  were met with the
statement that the Government did not intend to deviate from the line
of conduct  adopted after mature deliberation in regard to the ancient
monuments of Java  restricting its care to preservation of the remains
   a characteristic sample of Governmental cant in the face of grossest
carelessness and the kind of preservation inflicted on the  chandi
Panataran or wherever its officials felt constrained by public opinion
to act upon make believe circulars from Batavia and Buitenzorg before
pigeon holing them  And so the perplexing inconsistencies of Dutch East
Indian finance  parsimony playing  chassez croisez  with boundless
prodigality  are faithfully mirrored in the tribulations of the  chandi
Mendoot  the reauthorised work of restoration was stopped again  on the
usual progress killing plea of  kurang wang   after the adjustment of
the first tier above the cornice  and the temple  bereft of its crowning
roof in dagob style  calculated to fix the basic conception in the
beholder s mind  has in its stunted condition been aptly compared to a
bird of gorgeous plumage  all ruffled and with the crest feathers pulled
out

Illustration  XXIV   CHANDI  MENDOOT AFTER ITS RESTORATION

Archaeological Service

The operations were hampered by still other contrarieties  A tremendous
battle was waged apropos of the question whether or not gaps in the
layers of stones of the front wall above the porch pointed to the
existence of a passage or passages for the admittance of air and light
to the inner chamber  if so  whether or not those passages inclined
at an angle sufficient to let the sun s rays illumine the head of
the principal statue in that inner chamber  To rehearse the heated
dispute is not profitable  as usual  after the  chandi  had fallen
into ruin and an endless official correspondence had lifted its ruin
into prominence  archaeological faddists of every description tried to
acquire fame with absurd suggestions and crazy speculations  Leaving
their theories regarding the inclinations of the axes of probable or
possible transmural apertures for what they are  more instruction is to
be derived from the decorative arrangements  The inherent beauty of the
ornament survived happily the injurious effects of changing monsoons
of ruthless robbery  of preservation in the Government sense of the
word  When the sun caresses it  the Friendly Day  under the blue vault
of the all compassing sky  smiling at this gem of human art  offered
in conjugal obedience by the earth  which trembles at his touch  it
seems a sacrificial gift of reflowering mortality to heaven  In art
said Lessing  the privilege of the ancients was to give no thing either
too much or too little  and the remark of the great critic  as here
we can see  applies to a wider range of classic activity than he had
in mind  Wherever the ancient artist wrought  in Greece or in Java
we find moreover that he drew his inspiration directly from nature
that his handiwork reflects his consciousness of the moving soul of the
world  that the secret of its imperishable charm lies pre eminently in
his keenness of observation  To Javanese sculpture in this period may
be applied what Fergusson remarked of Hindu sculpture some thousand
years older in date  It is thoroughly original  absolutely without a
trace of foreign influence  but quite capable of expressing its ideas
and of telling its story with a distinction that never was surpassed
at least in India  Some animals  such as elephants  deer and monkeys
are better represented there than in any sculptures known in any part
of the world  so  too  are some trees and the architectural details are
cut with an elegance and precision which are very admirable  Turning to
the Mendoot we notice how the sculptors charged with its decoration
always truthful and singularly accurate in the expression of their
thoughts and feelings  portrayed their surroundings in outline and
detail  wrote in bas reliefs  ornament and statuary the history  the
ethics  the philosophy  the religion of the people they belonged to and
materialised their splendid dreams for  What conveys a better knowledge
of the Tripitaka  the Buddhist system of rules for the conduct of life
discipline and metaphysics  than their imagery  coloured by the very
hue of kindliness and effacement of self in daily intercourse  what
inculcates better the  paramitas   the six virtues  and charity the
first of them  than their carved mementos of the reverence we owe to
the life of all sentient creatures  our poor relations the animals
striving on lower planes to obtain ultimate delivery from sin and pain
but no less entitled to benevolence than man

As in the decoration of the younger  chandis  Panataran and Toompang
fables occupy a prominent position in that of the  chandi  Mendoot
Among the twenty two scenes spread over the nearly triangular spaces
to the right and left of the staircase which ascends to the entrance
eleven on each side  partly lost and wholly damaged  are  for instance
reliefs illustrative of the popular stories of the tortoise and the
geese  of the brahman  the crab  the crow and the serpents  etc  Of one
of them only a small fragment is left  representing a turtle with its
head turned upward  gazing at something in the air  whence Dr  Brandes
infers its connection with the following tale  inserted in the account
of the concerted action of the animals which conspired to kill the
elephant  as rendered in the  Tantri   an old Javanese collection of
fables  Once upon a time there were turtles who took counsel together
about the depredations of a ravenous vulture and their  kabayan   chief
of the community  asked   What do you intend to do to escape being
eaten by that bird  Accept my advice and lay him a wager that you can
cross the sea quicker than he  if he laughs at your conceit  you must
crawl into the sea where the big waves are  except two of you  one who
stays to start on the race when he begins to fly  and one who swims
across the day before and waits for him at the other side  What do you
think  turtles  You cannot lose if you manage this well   Your advice is
excellent  answered they  and while the  kabayan  was still instructing
them  the vulture arrived and demanded a turtle to eat   What is your
hurry  spoke the  kabayan  for them all  I bet you that any one of us
can swim quicker across the sea than you can fly   I take that bet
replied the vulture  but what shall I have if I win   If you win
you will be at liberty to eat me and my people and our children and
grandchildren and great grandchildren and so on and so on to the end of
time  but you must pledge your word that if you lose  you will move from
here and seek your food elsewhere  It is now rather late but to morrow
morning you can choose any one of my people you please to match your
swift flight with   All right  said the vulture and he went to his nest
to sleep  but the  kabayan  sent one of his turtle people across the
sea  The vulture showed himself again a little after dawn  not to waste
time  for he felt pretty hungry and the sooner he could win the race
the sooner he would have breakfast  He did not even take the precaution
to select an adversary among the decrepit and slow  so sure was he of
his superiority  and  besides  all the turtles were so much alike  The
kabayan  counted one  two  three  go  and the vulture heard one of
them plunge into the water and he unfolded his wings and alighted at
the other side in an instant  when  lo  there he saw the beast calmly
waiting for him  The vulture felt ashamed and moved to a distant
country for he did not know that he had been cheated  And there was only
one vulture but there were many turtles  And the boar told this event to
his friends  exactly as the reverend Basubarga saw it happen

Another fable  still more widely distributed and clinching the same
moral  is that of the  kanchil   a small  extremely fleet species of
deer  and the snail  travelling to Europe  it is there best known in its
German form recorded by Jakob and Wilhelm Grimm  Of its many variants
in the Malay Archipelago we may mention the wager between a snail and a
tiger as to which could most easily jump a river  the snail  attaching
herself to one of her big competitor s paws  wins  of course  and
convinces the terror of the woods by means of his hairs adhering to her
body  that she is accustomed to feed on his kind  two or three per diem
freshly killed  whereupon the tiger leaves off blustering and sneaks
away  130  The prose version of the  Tantri  which  somewhat different
from the two metrical readings known to us  contains the vulture and
turtle incident  dates probably from the last half of the Mojopahit
period and is therefore at least four centuries younger than the
chandi  Mendoot  so that its author and the sculptors of the scenes
from popular beast stories on the temple s walls  must have had access
to a common stock of ancient fables  All turned it to best advantage
and the decorators of this splendid edifice seized their opportunity to
let the men and animals they carved in illustration of their national
literature  express what they had to say in their passionate overflow of
the creative instinct  They gave their narrative a frame in ornament of
dazzling beauty  sweetly harmonious with the moral of the lessons they
taught  stirring to deepest emotion  they cased thoughts of happiest
purport in shrines embossed and laced with fretwork more suggestive
of ivory than of stone  They adorned the Mendoot as a bride  to be
displayed before her husband  the Boro Budoor  revelling in the fanciful
idea which makes the  saktis  of the Dhyani Buddhas carry budding
flowers to honour incarnate love  The wealth of statuary  while orthodox
Buddhism did not admit the worship of images either of a saintly founder
of temples or of his saintly followers  the deities with the attributes
of Doorga  Siva and Brahma  who diversify the ornament of the exterior
walls  from which right distribution of lines and surfaces may be learnt
in rhythmical relation to contour and dimension  are further indications
of the syncretism signalising the tolerance  the fraternal mingling of
different creeds in the distant age of Mataram s vigour and artistic
energy

The religious principles underlying that empire s greatness and
providing a basis for a firm sense of duty to guide a temperament of
fire  are nobly embodied in the three gigantic statues placed in the
inner chamber of the Mendoot or  to be quite exact  round which that
chandi  was reared  for the entrance is too small to let them through
especially the largest of them which  miraculously undamaged save one
missing finger tip  has slid down from its pedestal and consequently
occupies a lower station between the subordinate figures than originally
intended  All three are seated and the first in rank  of one piece
with his unembellished throne  measures fourteen feet  the two to his
right and left  of less grave aspect  wearing richly wrought necklaces
armlets  wristbands  anklets and tiaras  measure eight feet each  If the
oorna  131  more excellent than a crown  identifies the master among
them  the position of whose fingers reminds of Vajrochana  the first
Dhyani Buddha  the others have been taken respectively for a Bodhisatva
and for a devotee who attained by his meritorious life a high degree
of saintliness but whose Brahmanic adornment flatly contradicts the
Buddhist character of such perfection  This explanation is therefore
considered unsatisfactory and unacceptable by many  as  for instance
his Majesty Somdetch Phra Paramindr Chulalongkorn  the late King of
Siam  who  by the way  when visiting the  chandis  Mendoot and Boro
Budoor in 1896  claimed those masterpieces of  mahayanistic  art for
his own  the southern church  to use the incorrect but convenient
distinction  According to this royal interpreter  the idea was to
represent the Buddha in the act of blessing the Buddhist prince who
ordered the Boro Budoor to be built  here placed at his right with an
image of the deliverer in his  makuta  and carrying no  upawita  but
a monk s robe under the insignia of his dignity  the third statue
directly opposite  at the Buddha s left  without Buddhist accessories
but with an  upawita  hanging down from its left shoulder  might
impersonate him again in his state before conversion  or his unconverted
father on whom  after death  he wished to bestow a share in the
deliverer s benediction  However this may be  there is no doubt of the
Enlightened One s identity in one of his many personifications and
leaving the eighty secondary marks unexplored  three for the nails
three for the fingers  three for the palms of the hands  three for the
forty evenly set teeth  one for the nose  six for the piercing eyes
five for the eyebrows  three for the cheeks  nine for the hair  ten
for the lower members in general   without our entering into further
detail    the thirty two primary signs are all present  the protuberance
on the top of the skull  the crisped hair  of a glossy black which the
sculptor could not reproduce  curling towards the right  132  the ample
forehead  the  oorna   which sheds a white light  also unsculpturable
as the sheen of polished silver or snow smiled upon by the sun  etc
Though the colossal statue of the welcome redeemer  like those of the
worshipping kings  does not recommend itself by faultless modelling
it breathes the spirit which sustains the  arahat   him who becomes
worthy  it radiates the tranquil felicity of annihilation of existence
sin  sorrow and pain  it promises the final blowing out of life s
candle  the Nirvana  when the understanding will be reached of the
Adi Buddha  the primitive  primordial  immeasurable  And the lowest of
the four degrees of the Nirvana  it seems to say  is already attainable
on earth by emancipation from the bondage of fleshly desire and vice
by avoidance of that which taints and corrupts     The noonday glare
subdued by the heavy shadow of the porch  fills the sanctuary with a
golden haze and upon its dimly gleaming wings a faint music descends
a song of deliverance  The psalmist s visions of the covering of
iniquity compass us about and invite to recognition of a common source
of divine inspiration in mankind of whatever creed  The scent of the
melati  and  champaka  flowers  strewn at the feet and in the lap of
the deity  the image of him who taught that there is none such  and
revered by professed believers in the Book which consigns idolaters
to hell fire   mingles with the pungent odour of the droppings of the
bats  fluttering and screeching things in the dark recesses of the roof
disturbed in their sleep  Truly there ought to be a limit to syncretism
and this last mentioned mixture of heterogeneous elements soon affects
the visitor in a manner so offensive that retreat becomes a matter of
necessity

Illustration  XXV  INTERIOR OF THE  CHANDI  MENDOOT

Cephas Sr

As we step outside  our eyes are blinded by the burning light inundating
the valley  the fiery furnace ablaze at the foot of mountains flaming up
to the sky  a terror of beauty  Think of the fire that shall consume all
creation and early seek your rescue  said the Buddha  It speaks to us of
the cataclysm which shook Java on her foundation in the waters and upset
the work of man  killing him in his thousands and burying his temples
the Mendoot and many  many more  under the ashes of her volcanoes  some
such upheaval as when the conflict began between the Saviour of the
World and the Great Enemy  to quote from the sacred scriptures  when
the earth was convulsed  the sea uprose from its bed  the rivers turned
back to their sources  the hill tops fell crashing to the plains  when
the day at length was darkened and a host of headless spirits rode upon
the tempest  Though the ground has also been raised by the drift down
the slopes of the Merapi  by the overflowing runnels discharging their
load of mud into the Ello and the Progo  the magnitude of volcanic
devastation can be gauged from the difference in level between the base
of the  chandi  and the site of the  kampong  higher up  under which the
platform extends whereon its subsidiary buildings stood  Excavations
in the detritus have already resulted in the discovery of portions
of a brick parapet once enclosing the temple grounds  of vestiges of
smaller shrines in the east corner of the terrace and of a cruciform
brick substructure to the northeast with fragments of bell shaped
chaityas   133  of a Banaspati  probably from the balustrade of the
staircase  and detached stones with and without sculptured ornament
which revealed the former existence of several miniature temples
surrounding the central one  At the time of my last visit  which came
near terminating my career in my present earthly frame  through the
rotten scaffolding giving way under my feet when ascending to the roof
more than half of the space conjecturally encompassed by the parapet
still awaited exploration  and since then restoration  within the limits
of the scanty sums allowed  seems to have superseded excavation  In
connection with both  the names should be mentioned of P  H  van der
Ham  who did wonders with the little means at his disposal  and C
den Hamer  who showed that the decoration of the Mendoot too was not
completed before the great catastrophe which devastated Central Java and
stopped architectural pursuits  134

Reviewing the history of the ancient monuments of the island  not one
can pass without a repetition of the sad tale of spoliation  However
unpleasant it be to record in every single instance the culpable
negligence of a Government stiffening general indifference and almost
encouraging downright robbery  the rapid deterioration of those
splendid edifices allows no alternative in the matter of explanation
When officials and private individuals of the ruling race set the
example  the natives saw no harm in quarrying building material on
their own account for their own houses  and they had no time to lose in
the rapid process of the razing of their  chandis  for the adornment
of residency and assistant residency gardens  the construction of
dams  sugar mills and indigo factories  Temple stones have been found
in many villages round the Mendoot and particularly in Ngrajeg  about
two miles distant on the main road  there is no native dwelling in the
substructure of which they have not been used  135  Though the wealth of
the  dessa  Ngrajeg in this respect may be explained by its once having
boasted its own  chandi   of which nothing remains but the foundations
there is abundant proof that the chief quarry of the neighbourhood on
this side of the river was the Mendoot as the Boro Budoor on the other
From a juridical standpoint  the natives in possession of such spoil
acquired by their fathers or grandfathers  have a prescriptive right on
it not disputable in law  averred the administration at Batavia  and
so whatever the architects in charge of the restoration needed  had
to be bought back and diminished still further the disposable funds
Leaving the doubtful points of this legal question and the enforcement
in practice of the theoretical decision for what they are worth to
Kromo or Wongso  ordered to part with his doorstep or coinings  there is
no  doubt that it is illegal and highly censurable to demolish temples
and temples like the Mendoot at that  to secure building material for
Government dams and bridges  What happened in Mojokerto with the bricks
of Mojopahit and has been complained of elsewhere  I saw happen in
1885 with Mendoot stones  freely used for abutments  piers  spandrel
fillings  etc   when near by the spanning of the Progo was in progress
That bridge has since succumbed like the railway bridge then in course
of construction farther down the Progo  a warning which  if heeded
might have prevented  for instance  the chronic misfortunes of the
railway bridge in the Anei gorge  West Coast of Sumatra

With Government bridges lacking the strength to resist the impetuosity
of more than ordinarily boisterous freshets  there may always be a
surprise in store for the pilgrim to the Boro Budoor who has arrived
at the first station  the Mendoot  will he or will he not find the
means to cross  For  in time of  banjir    i e   when the river is in
spate  the primitive ferry which maintains the communication in lieu
of better  a bambu raft or two frail barges fastened together  fails
as to both comfort and safety  and after heavy rains large groups of
men and women can often be seen waiting for the turbulent waters to
quiet down a bit  Lord Kitchener visited the Mendoot in December
1909  during a bridgeless spell and conditions generally inauspicious
to his proceeding a mile and a half farther to the Boro Budoor
Otherwise the being ferried over in company of gaily dressed people
going to or coming from market with fruit  garden produce and all
sorts of merchandise for sale or bought  has its compensations  rocked
by the eddying stream which glides swiftly between its steep banks
our dominating sensation is one of joy in the splendour of unstinted
light  of freedom from the petty torments of everyday routine   and let
worry take care of itself  As we climb the opposite shore  comes the
mysteriously grateful feeling of being enveloped in the soil s genial
exhalation of warm contentment  the fertile earth s response to the
passionate embrace of the sun  Their espousal  their connubial ardour
appears incorporate in the  chandi  Dapoor  136  a petrified spark of
universal love  a wonder of structural and decorative skill in a shady
grove some hundred paces to the right of the road  137  And again the
spiritus mundi  is symbolically interpreted in the story of yond temple
betrothed and wedded to the tree  They were very much smitten with each
other  the  chandi  Pawon and a  randu alas  138  living in the hamlet
Brajanala  They married and the pretty comedy of affection turned into
tragedy  as chances very often in the case of a weaker and a stronger
partner in the matrimonial game  the latter throve and prospered at the
expense of the former  Now of his brothers there were and still are many
exactly like him  but of her sisters there were only few and none of
her peculiar kind of beauty  and since it seemed a pity that she should
waste her singular comeliness in supporting a husband of no particular
worth for all his bigness and parade of protecting her  a divorce was
resolved upon which meant his sentence of death  Voices in favour of
reprieve or commutation of the penalty were disregarded  what did one
randu alas  more or less matter compared with the preservation of the
exquisite  chandi  Pawon  sole surviving representative of her class  So
the tree was cut down and she escaped happily the fate which overtook
the  chandis  Perot and Pringapoos  The  chandi  Pawon was even wholly
restored  its foundations  sapped by a tangle of roots  relaid  its roof
reconstructed  139  In its graceful proportions a striking illustration
of the truth that a great architect can show the vast range of his art
in a very small building  may it stand many centuries longer between
Mendoot and Boro Budoor as the typical expression of Javanese thought in
Dravidian style

All is quiet and still in the stately avenue of  kanaris  140  and few
wayfarers are likely to be met  except after  puasa   141   Than longen
folke to gon on pilgrimages   and the Boro Budoor attracts a goodly
crowd bent on sacrifice to the statue in the crowning dagob or to lesser
images held in special veneration  Such travelling companions  merrily
but sedately intent on devotional exercise conformable to ancestral
custom  notwithstanding Moslim doctrine  their forefathers  imaginations
tingeing their conceptions of life seen and unseen because of their
forefathers  blood running in their veins  increase the cheery solace

CHAPTER IX

THE STONES OF THE BORO BUDOOR

       la vÃ©ritÃ© rendue expressive et parlante  Ã©levÃ©e Ã  la hauteur
   d une idÃ©e  ERNEST RENAN   Vie de JÃ©sus    Introduction


The  pasangrahan   built for the convenience of visitors to the
Boro Budoor  offers fair accommodation to the student of oriental
architecture and lover of art in whatever form  Also to a good many
who feel it incumbent on them to be able to say   I have taken
everything in   or who have quite other ends in view than communion
with the thought of distant ages  foreign tourists whose principal
care is to exhibit trunks and travelling bags covered with labels of
out of the beaten track hotels while their brains remain hopelessly
empty  junketers of domestic growth  often in couples whose irregular
relations seek shelter behind the excuse of  doing  the island  and
heartily disinclined to practise the virtues preached in the reliefs
of the shrine of shrines  particularly down on continence  So even the
Philistines derive advantage  after the notions of their kind  from the
ramshackle fabric of vile heathenism  as this magnificent temple has
been called by one of their number  and its visitors  book tells a sorry
tale of irreclaimable vulgarity  the wit  laboriously aimed at in many
entries  but widely missed  partakes altogether too much  minus the
element of  badinage   of the answer given by a young naval officer to
an old aunt when she asked him where  in his opinion  the most striking
natural scenery of Java was to be found  At Petit Trouville  143  said
he  on Sunday in the dry season

The  pasangrahan s  guests of that ilk are generally no early risers and
their company is therefore not likely to mar the impression received
of the Boro Budoor at second sight after supper  supplied by the army
pensioner in charge of the place  and a night s sound rest  Looking
tranquillity itself  the vast pile charms and soothes the heart
notwithstanding its enormous size  before the intellect  scrutinising
its outline  begins to marvel at the unaccustomed form the builder has
chosen to proclaim his idea  Save one or two temples in  hinayanistic
Burmah  which present a faint resemblance  nothing else can be named as
producing the same effect  but then  wrote Fergusson for the land where
the creed was born that inspired its founder  it must be remembered that
not a single structural Buddhist building now exists within the cave
region of Western India  Rising light and airy for all its grandeur  it
expresses more strength than a mere massing together of the ponderous
material in huge walls and buttresses and towers could have done  its
quiet consciousness of power is enhanced by its strange beauty of
contour in perfect harmony with its setting of living colour  There it
lies  clasping together the sapphire sky and the emerald garden of Java

The  mahayanistic  character of the Boro Budoor is well attested by
the Dhyani Buddhas among its statuary  despite the opinion of Siamese
connoisseurs  and by its further ornamental sculpture  of which more
anon  Meant for a reliquary  it may or may not be  in the absence of
historical proof pro or contra  one of the 84 000  stupas  consecrated
to receive and hold a fractional portion of the Indian Saviour s remains
after King Asoka had opened seven of the depositories of his ashes in
the eight towns among which his remains were originally divided  to
make the whole world share in their blessed possession  Who has not
heard of the transfer  in the ninth year of the reign of Sirimeghavanna
A D  310  of the Dathadathu  the holy tooth  from Dantapura to Ceylon
where it became the  mascotte   so to speak  the pledge of undisturbed
dominion to the rulers of the island who should control its guardians
The sacrosanct yellow piece of dentin  about the length of the little
finger  144  enclosed in nine concentric cases of gold  inlaid with
diamonds  rubies and pearls  is but rarely shown  far more rarely than
even the seamless coat at Treves  and then under conditions of excessive
adoration  But  notwithstanding all this pomp and circumstance  who that
has visited the Dalada Malagawa at Kandy and the Boro Budoor in Java
can fail to prefer the latter  though sacrilegious robbers have carried
off its relic  leaving the desecrated shrine to decay

The wordy war waged around the etymology of the name Boro Budoor  did
not solve the mystery of its origin  all derivations thus far suggested
are mere guess work and unsatisfactory  whatever reasons be adduced for
Roorda van Eysinga s explanation that it means an enclosed space  or
Raffles  surmise that it is a corruption of Bara  the great  Buddha
or the late King of Siam s that it refers to the  spiritual  army of
the Buddha  if not to the several Buddhas  as alleged by others  One
of the oldest existing monuments in the island  the foundation of the
chandi  Boro Budoor has been attributed by native tradition to Raden
Bandoong  already known from the legends connected with the  chandis
Prambanan and Sewu  who  as King of Pengging  assumed the name of
Handayaningrat  Professor Kern 145  puts the date of the substructure
at about 850  allowing several years for its completion  if ever it
was fully completed  for this temple  like the  chandi  Mendoot near
by  the  chandi  Bimo on the DiÃ«ng plateau and so many more  shows
traces of the work having been suspended before the decoration was quite
finished  Sculpture just commenced or little further advanced than the
bare outlining  found on the walls  especially of the covered base
divers blocks of stone half transformed into ornament and statuary
Dhyani Buddhas and lions  very illustrative of the methods followed at
different stages of the carving  lying forsaken on the slope and summit
of a neighbouring hillock  disclose an interruption of the labour by
some event of tremendous consequence  146  Rather than accept the theory
that the ancient temples of Java were left intentionally defective from
religious motives  viz  to emphasise the sense of human imperfection
as an incentive to humility and prostration before the divine  we may
believe in the Merapi  that wicked old giant  having asserted himself in
one of his destructive moods  belching forth flames and ashes  shaking
and burying the handiwork of Hindu and Buddhist pygmies with strictest
impartiality  Standing on the first of the highest terraces on the south
side  says an article 147  in the  Javapost  of December 5  1903  one
observes a bulging out of the lower terraces  best accounted for by a
violent earthquake in a southerly direction  When the galleries were
cleared in 1814 and 1834  the volcanic character of the detritus which
filled them  ashes from the Merapi  wrote Roorda van Eysinga in 1850
and also forms the substratum of the rubbish still unremoved from the
once enclosed grounds of the  chandi  Mendoot  furnished strong evidence
in support of an eruption of the nearest fire mountain having been the
cause of the precipitate flight  perhaps the death in harness  of the
builders  Of the preservation of their work too  in so far as finished
for  to speak again with the writer in the  Javapost   the very fact
of its having been embedded has saved much of its artistic detail
and the reason why some of the sculptured parts are damaged to a far
greater extent than others adjoining  is probably that they were exposed
earlier and longer  Deterioration and demolition set in rapidly when
wind and weather began to ravage the wholly unprotected edifice  when
unscrupulous collectors wrought havoc unchecked

The Boro Budoor was never hidden from view to the point of blotting
out its existence from memory  I shall have occasion to refer to
native chronicles mentioning it in the eighteenth century  To speak
of its rediscovery by Cornelius is therefore inaccurate though we owe
to that clever Lieutenant of Engineers  purposely sent to the Kadu by
Raffles  in 1814  the first scientific survey and description with
elucidating drawings  Except for the publication  in 1873  of Dr  C
Leemans  book with an atlas containing illustrations after drawings
by F  C  Wilsen  and the mission of I  van Kinsbergen to obtain
photographic reproductions of the reliefs  the Dutch Government left the
matchless temple entirely to its fate until very recently  An official
correspondence  kept trailing indefinitely to invest ministerial
promises regarding the antiquities of Java with a semblance of
sincerity  had the usual negative effect  Whenever a colonial Excellency
declared with unctuous pomposity that the most conscientious care would
be taken of the Boro Budoor  a monument of incalculable value considered
from the standpoint of science and art  most brilliant memento of the
island s historic past  etc   etc   those versed in the phraseology
of Plein and Binnenhof at the Hague trembled in expectation of bad
news of criminal negligence  theft and mutilation to follow  The later
history of the  brilliant memento  agrees but too well with the ominous
prognostics derived from such dismal parliamentary fustian  A great
poet sang of things of beauty scarce visible from extreme loveliness
the readily movable things of beauty constituting the loveliness of the
Boro Budoor  became invisible  sans phrase   We are told in legendary
lore of statues which flew through the air to take domicile at enormous
distances from their proper homes  or vanished altogether  dissolving
into space  the statues of the Boro Budoor developed that faculty in an
astonishing degree  if handicapped by great weight or solid attachment
to the main structure  bent on travelling  Ã  tout travers   they sent
their heads alone to seek recreation and instruction in the varying ways
of the world  and their heads did never return  either because they
were amusing themselves too jollily away from the austerities of the
eight fold path or because they found themselves unavoidably detained in
durance vile

The remaining  mostly headless statues are sad to behold  and the fishy
account given of their defective condition  that  namely  the Buddhists
beleaguered in the sanctuary by the Muhammadans  battling  pro aris
et focis   drove the enemies off by bombarding them with the Lord of
Victory s noble features  hewn in stone  smacks of a too ingenious
evasion of the disgraceful facts  148  The chronicles are silent on such
a desperate struggle in that locality between the conquering hosts of
IslÄm and the followers of him who pleaded peace  love and goodwill
whose doctrine and example alike forbade strife and armed resistance
Not that there has been no fighting round and even within the walls of
the Boro Budoor among the Javanese engaged in internecine warfare and
during the insurrection of Dipo Negoro  149  but the story of the using
up of the statuary in the shape of missiles  has no leg to stand on  In
the Java War  1825 1830  the Dutch troops erected a temporary fort near
the temple  but it is improbable that  chandi  material entered into
its construction  not because the warriors of the Government would have
scrupled to destroy any ancient monument  but because the Boro Budoor
stones are exceedingly heavy and earthen fortifications amply sufficed
against native bands without artillery  Though cavalry in particular
never enjoyed a high reputation in respect of their relations to
art  150  there does not seem to be any more substance in the confession
of a  ci devant  commander of a squadron of hussars  cited by Brumund
that his men used to try the temper of their swords on the ears and
noses of the silent host of Dhyani Buddhas when the rebels of Sentot and
Kiahi Maja were not available

The true misfortune of the Boro Budoor was official indifference and
negligence  and far more injurious than the fretting tooth of time or
even the merciless hand of the spoiler combined with the provoking
laissez aller  yawned in periodical circulars from the central
administration  from Sleepy Hollow at Batavia  was the dabbling in
archaeology of ambitious persons who posed as discoverers  the less
their aptitude to digest their desultory reading  the more arrogant
their cock sureness where famous scholars reserved  their  conclusions
A little knowledge is a dangerous thing and might have proved disastrous
to the venerable temple in combination with one of their vaunted
discoveries  which established beyond doubt what not a few knew well
enough and never had doubted of  viz  that there was a gallery lower
than its lowest uncovered terrace  wisely filled up to increase the
stability of the building  very probably soon after or even before the
erection of the upper storeys  The removal of the supporting layers of
stone impaired  of course  the general condition of the structure and
the good news of its being again in its former state  was received by
many with a sigh of relief  This happened in 1885 with great flourish
of trumpets  and the only benefit derived  certainly not of sufficient
importance to balance the inevitable weakening of the foundations
attendant on such excavations  consisted in the bringing to light of
rude  scarcely decipherable inscriptions or rather scratchings  151  and
the intelligence that of the photographed sculptures  in which  so far
no representation of connected events has been recognised  twenty four
are unfinished and thirteen damaged  six wholly smashed  In 1900 new
shafts were sunk for new discoveries of the long and widely known  and
while this pernicious dilettantism was going on  pseudo archaeologists
vying with professed iconoclasts who should do most harm to the Boro
Budoor  the Government confined itself to antiquarian pyrotechnics at
the yearly debates on the colonial budget in Parliament

The Boro Budoor being undermined and gradually scattered to the four
winds  it was but natural that the natives  following the example set
by the elect  even by the elect of the elect acting in this or that
official capacity  who used  for instance   chandi  stones for the
flooring of the Government  pasangrahan    that the inhabitants of the
neighbouring  kampongs  should carry off what appeared suitable for
their own ends  and the least heavy  jataka  reliefs claimed their first
attention  So things went from bad to worse and the most disastrous
year  a veritable  annus calamitatis  for the Boro Budoor  arrived with
1896  when the late King of Siam paid his second visit to Java  Much
interested  as was to be expected of a ruler of a Buddhist country
in the Buddhist monuments of the island  so interested  in fact  that
his Majesty tried to put the  mahayanistic  temples of the Kadu to the
credit of his own  the  hinayanistic  church  his endeavours in this
kind of mental annexation inspired authorities  eager to share in the
honours of Siamese Knighthood  White Elephant  Crown of Siam  etc
distributed with right royal generosity  to urge him to annexation
in deed  If foreign visitors of little account had been permitted to
help themselves in a small way to  souvenirs  for a consideration to
keepers  underlings left without control  why should foreign visitors
of distinction not be served wholesale  His Majesty Chulalongkorn  to
whom no blame attaches for gratifying his desire where he found Dutch
functionaries  high and low  more than willing to oblige  was invited to
make his choice and we must still thank him for his moderation  which
limited the quantity of sculpture selected to eight cart loads  there is
scarcely a doubt that if he had requested them to pull part of the Boro
Budoor down in consideration of Knight Commander  or Grand Masterships
in this or that Order  the official conscience would have raised no
objection  This came to pass  of course  after a more than usually
fine flow  at the Hague  of ministerial rhetoric anent the priceless
heritage Holland has to protect in the  brilliant mementos of Java s
historic past   and the lover of ancient Buddhist architecture who wants
to make a study of its acknowledged masterpiece  must now of necessity
travel on to the banks of the Meynam to get an idea of some of its
most characteristic imagery  not to speak of fragments of ornament and
statuary removed by tourists of commoner complexion and dispersed heaven
knows where

This instance of the ancient monuments of Java being officially
despoiled to please crowned heads and other visitors in exalted
stations   pour le bon motif   seemed so incredible that  when
I censured it in the Dutch East Indian Press  the Dutch Press
over zealous in hiding colonial enormities  also  pour le bon motif
considered it an easy task to deny  waxing eloquently indignant at the
denunciation until in regular  normal sequence  always observable
in the perennial case of Dutch whitewashing versus colonial boldness
of speech  the correctness of the statement could no longer be
assailed  new evidence accumulating steadily  Mr  J  A  N  Patijn
for one  describing  in the  Kroniek  and the  Tijdschrift voor
Nederlandsch IndiÃ«   a collection displayed near the Wat Pra Keo at
Bangkok and brought thither from Java in 1896  152  The frolicking
monkeys doubtless  the people of the large cheek bones  represented
on some reliefs thus transferred  prompted an enthusiastic  genuine
archaeologist s imprecation on the heads of the guilty official
and non official toadies  inasmuch as he wished them  if there be
anything in the dogma of Karma  which provides for our sins being
visited on us in lives to come  that their least punishment might be
their transformation  when called to new birth  into apes abandoned
to ceaseless squabbles over their  kanari  nuts  honours  dignities
preferment with big salaries  fat pensions  etc    clawing one another
with their sharp nails  to find at last that all the shells are
empty  Desisting from a profitless discussion on the possibilities of
retribution in a future existence  it requires to be stated that the
official mind needed several years  reflection in this before reaching
the conclusion that really  in the matter of the conservation of the
Boro Budoor something more was wanted than the periodical outbursts of
gushing sentiment  grossly disregarded in practice  which are  le moyen
de parvenir  of Dutch colonial politicians  The independents of the
colonial Press  however  had at last the satisfaction that Captain T
van Erp of the Engineers was detailed to take the work of restoration in
hand  building himself a house in the shadow of the  chandi  confided to
his care  anxious to direct the necessary labours on the spot  Stationed
there since August  1907  his promotion to the rank of Major fortunately
did not result in the withdrawal of his services from the archaeological
field and  the climax of laxness with regard to the Boro Budoor having
been capped in the Siamese episode  brighter days may dawn for that
venerable edifice

One of the rooms of the  pasangrahan   reserved  under the old
dispensation  for the storing of detached pieces of sculpture  was
called the sample room because  according to current report  orders
were taken there for the delivery of such still undetached ornament
and statuary as might have struck the visitors  fancy  Other images
lined the path from the  pasangrahan  to the temple  among them two
Dhyani Buddhas  a fine Akshobhya and a still finer Amitabha  and lions
the poor remainder of those which once adorned the steps leading to
the raised level of the building  whence the name  Avenue of Lions
Seemingly commanded to descend from the places where they kept guard as
solitary sentinels  and to unite for defence at the point of greatest
danger  terrible havoc was wrought in their ranks by the onslaught
of souvenir hunters  and one of their large limbed  beautifully
chiselled chiefs  who himself watched the entrance with a vauntful air
as if proclaiming to foe and friend alike   Et s il n en reste qu un
moi je serai celui lÃ    had to suffer the ignominy of being captured
and carried off to Siam  which proves his Majesty Chulalongkorn s good
taste  it was the best specimen of animal carving on that scale in
Java  These are no cheerful reflections when approaching the eminence
skillfully converted into a  stupa  whose equal  both in originality
of design and cleverness of execution  can nowhere be found  Though
India furnished its prototype  the style here evolved baffles  on close
examination  all comparison  The only building it can be likened to is
the Taj Mahal at Agra  and only in this single respect while differing
in all others  that  conceived by a titanic intellect  the delicate
decoration suggests the minute precision of the jeweller s craft
Opening and closing a distinct chapter in architecture  this admirable
production rises in terraces which form galleries round the hill top
enclosed by walls  spaced on the outside by 432 niches for statues of
the Buddha with  prabha   aureole  and  padmasana   lotus cushion   on
the inside with representations illustrating sacred and profane writings
in bas relief  the galleries of the superstructure raised on the
square ground plan  become circular and are bounded by 72 bell shaped
chaityas  containing statues of the Buddha without either  prabha  or
padmasana   or any ornament whatever  The profuse decoration of their
surroundings never detracts from the powerfully expressed central
idea of praise to the Enlightened One  the one who has fulfilled his
end  the repetition of the motives manifesting the religious purpose
directs rather than confuses the attention of the worshipper in their
multiformity of application  The spiritual father of the Boro Budoor
must have been a man of strong mental grasp  of honest masculine
endeavour stimulated by a highly sensitive temperament  his work   a
goodly heap for to behold   growing in dignity and beauty the closer
it is observed  a realisation of the sublimest aspirations of Buddhist
Java  will perpetuate also  as long as it can endure  the memory of his
own superior mind

The constructive ability of this gifted builder was no less wonderful
than his mastery of detail in aid of his main intent  A clever
system of drainage attests to the foresight of his workmanship  but
the gutters remaining filled up and the gargoyles  open mouthed
nagas   choked after the excavation of the galleries in 1814 and
1834  without any one thinking of clearing them too  the water had to
flow off as best it could in the torrential rains of successive west
monsoons  filtering through the fissures between the stones  passing
down to the foundations and adding  in oozing out  to the causes of
decay by washing the supporting layers of earth and gravel away  The
staircases and passageways to the different terraces and galleries
are constructed with the accurate sense of right proportion which
distinguishes the natives of the island up to this day  and their
naga   and  kala makara  ornament belongs to the most impressive part
of the graceful decoration  In our ascent from lower to higher planes
of understanding  increasing in perception of the mysteries of life
and death  the Banaspati shows the road  the Hindu Javanese Gorgon s
head as Horsfield called it  appropriated by Buddhist architecture
figurating the terrors of error it faces while budding forth in the
promise of further guidance for whoso shall leave the world s delusions
a loved wife  a young born son  to seek the truth in pursuance of the
Buddha s ordinance  no intimidation which threatens with the pains of
hell all who dare to disobey the dictates of priestly ambition  but an
assurance of beatitude gained by self purification  The staircases of
the superstructure correspond with the four approaches leading up the
hillock to the temple yard  in the course of the excavations  undertaken
to facilitate the work of restoration  one of them  very much out of
repair  has been laid bare  The reconstruction of the lower principal
staircase  whose original position has now been determined  will
result  it is hoped  in the removal of the unsightly flight of uneven
steps masquerading as the main entrance at the corner opposite the
pasangrahan   and  perhaps  to provide one worthy of site and building
the Government will not haggle over the modest sum required for the
re erection of the monumental gate whose remains were discovered
adjoining the balustrade of the spacious elevated platform

On entering the galleries  establishing contact with this symmetrical
embodiment of highly spiritualised thought in the strongly knit language
of chiselled stone  to mount to the state of the perfect disciple
spurred by the figured evolution of the four degrees of Dhyana which
lead to supreme happiness  the pilgrim must have experienced  as we do
the sensation of physical well being imparted by the splendour of nature
wrapping human longings in sunshine and the delicious odour exhaled
by mother earth  The luxurious emotion increases  despite nirvanic
chastening  and among the serene images of the higher terraces  who
can remain unmoved in contemplation of the ancient temple lifting its
dagob to the blue heaven  of its hoary walls touched by the golden
light  quivering in desire of sacred communion  Nor do we cease to
marvel when turning from the general idea of universal solidarity
enunciated in an irreproachable architectural form  to the expository
details of decoration  The ornament accommodates itself with amazing
facility to the characteristic tendencies of the ground plan  never
perverting the central purpose  which dominates in a most felicitous
combination of the two principles separately developed for western ends
in the classic and gothic styles  the horizontal expansion to allow
thinking space to the brain and the mystic pointing upward to satisfy
the cravings of the heart  Both found application in the Boro Budoor
their unity of thought in diversity of expression being consolidated by
an inexhaustible wealth of imagery  elucidating accessories  filled as
it is  with sculptures rarest  of forms most beautiful and strange
Faithful in choice of subject and manner of representation to the
notions of its time  bodying forth things unknown to our age  the
ornament surprises by its fanciful invention and peculiar treatment
though always in the best of taste  The heavy cornice which protects
the lowest uncovered tier of external  so far not yet satisfactorily
explained reliefs  carries the niches for the statues already mentioned
The shape of these niches and of the temples delineated in the scenery
of the carved tales and legends  here as at Prambanan  Toompang  etc
afford us material assistance in determining after what model  chandis
long fallen into ruin  were built  they are especially helpful in
explaining the often puzzling arrangement of the superstructures  hardly
one being found  even among those best preserved  with the roof still
intact  Leaving archaeological problems alone  modern architects and
decorators can further derive a good deal of profit from a study of the
gradation observed in the downward radiation of both the architectural
and decorative conceit centred in the crowning dagob  or  rather  the
upward convergence in a nobly devised distribution of spaces connected
and entwined by cunning ornament  the luxuriant fantasy of the sculptor
being unerringly controlled by the staid design of the builder  A
fervent imagination may revel in miles of bas reliefs without surfeit
the salutary restraint of a sober outline and a proportional disposition
of the component parts being such that the eye never gets tired or the
faculty of perception cloyed

Fergusson  pointing to the identity of workmen and workmanship in the
sculpture and details of ornamentation at the Boro Budoor and at Ajunta
cave 26   Nassick  cave 17   the later caves at Salsette  Kondoty
Montpezir and other places in that neighbourhood  computes that at the
former the decoration extends to nearly 5000 feet  almost an English
mile  and  as there are sculptures on both faces  we have nearly 10 000
lineal feet of reliefs  They numbered 2141 in all  counting what
is damaged and altogether lost  but omitting the decoration of the
ornamental niches  on the lowest wall 408 in the upper and 160 in the
lower tier outside  568 inside  on the second wall  240 outside and 192
inside  on the third wall  108 outside and 165 inside  on the fourth
wall  88 outside and 140 inside  on the fifth wall  72 inside  Regarding
their noble qualities of style and decorative value as a component
of the general project  the opinion of a writer in the  Quarterly
Review  153  may be quoted  who discusses the Boro Budoor s straight
lines  its untroubled spaces of flat stone  its mouldings of classic
simplicity  its intricate and elaborate bands of ornament  held in place
by the nice choice of relief  being low and unaccented  in opposition
to the deep cutting and full modelling of the panels they surround  and
in these panels  he continues  in spite of the full roundness of the
modelling and the wealth of ornamental detail  the unity is maintained
by a fine sense of rhythm and discreet massing and spacing  The upper
tier of carvings on the inner wall of the first gallery  haut reliefs
in contradistinction to the rest  represents the life of the Buddha
from his birth until his death and is the best preserved  Many of the
others have suffered so badly that they baffle explanation  taken on
the whole  they treat of traditional occurrences in connection with
the Buddha himself or his predecessors  of gatherings under bo trees
pilgrimages to reliquaries  alms giving  exhortations to observe the
law  admonitions to virtue  abstinence  tolerance and charity  Animal
fables are interwoven with  jataka  tales   i e   narratives concerning
the Buddha before he appeared as the perfect man  tracing his path to
holiness in his adventures as a hare  a fish  a quail  a swan  a deer
the king of monkeys  an elephant  a bull  a wood pecker  a tortoise
the horse Balaha  every metamorphosis serving to illustrate his zeal
to sacrifice himself for his fellow creatures and  incidentally
stimulating the kindness we owe to our poor relations without the
power of speech  Professor Speyer s translation of legends collected
in the  Jatakamala   wreath of  jatakas   enables us to recognise in a
good many of the reliefs of the Boro Budoor the successive stages of
the Buddha on the road to supreme excellence  the figuration of his
progress being largely influenced by ancient Hindu folk lore

If Ruskin compared St  Mark s at Venice so aptly with a vast illuminated
missal  bound with alabaster instead of parchment  studded with porphyry
pillars instead of jewels  and written within and without in letters of
enamel and gold  in the Boro Budoor  a sacred book of volcanic stone
the life of the Buddha  before and after he became a son of man and
man s saviour  lies opened before us  the flowery earth and the shining
heaven are its binding  Surya  the sun himself  gilds and enamels the
letters  the images which  in their sculptured frame  not too deeply
cut and not too rich for a setting  but precisely adequate  tell to all
creatures the story of wisdom and elevation of spirit  The illustration
of the  Lalita Vistara  occupies  as already mentioned  the upper tier
of the inner wall of the first open gallery  Walking round in the proper
direction   i e   keeping the dagob to the right while moving with the
sun  we have first a few introductory scenes  leading up to the Buddha s
advent and preparing us for the mystic teachings of an imagery which
expands simply and naturally between the flowing lines of harmonious
ornament and speaks to the heart as does the sound of running water or
the soughing of the wind in the tree tops  Immediately after his birth
rising from the white lotus flower which has sprung from the earth at
the place touched by his feet  Siddhartha  in token of his power over
the several worlds  paces seven steps to each of the cardinal points
and to the abode of sin  announcing his mission  I shall conquer the
Prince of Darkness and the army of the Prince of Darkness  to save those
plunged into hell  I shall cause rain to descend from the huge cloud
of the law and they will be filled with joy and happiness  He grows
and marries and leaves his father s palace  moved by the misery of the
lowly and lost  to gather knowledge as Sakyamuni  until  compassing
all wisdom  he becomes impersonated truth and the great renunciation
takes place  The closing scene refers to his death  to the adoration of
the mortal remains of the immortal Tathagata  symbolising his course
among men not as a succession of past acts but as a constant one to
be imitated by whoso desires the reward  Increasing in excellence of
design and execution the nearer we approach the Holy of Holies  the
touching tale of a life of sacrifice is told with that straightforward
simplicity of which only the consummate artist possesses the secret
All appears so human and real  so inspiringly animated by the extreme
of vital motion  to use an oriental expression  the individuality of
the figures being always preserved in minutest personal detail without
the least affectation  Plastic triumphs  emphasising the lessons of the
sacred books  bring up unto us the people of  jaman buda   heroes tall
and strong as palm trees  virgins lithe and slender as bambu stems
with drooping eyes  shrinking from a too inquisitive gaze  with limbs
modelled as if they would tremble under the pressure of a caressing
hand

The statues  watching the ascent of the seeker of purification  second
the impulse received from the reliefs by their tranquil composure
that is in so far as they remained at their stations  for their ranks
are sadly thinned  Aspiring to the holiness figured in the images of
the higher terraces  to the priceless boon of the Nirvana as final
blessing  the Dhyani Buddhas  sunk in meditation  girding themselves
with virtue  longing for the ecstasies vouchsafed to the Adi Buddha s
meditation  reflect the five salient features of his understanding  as
indicated by their gestures  Divided into three or twice three groups
according to the position of their hands  and in intimate relationship
with their Bodhisatvas  Vajrochana  Akshobhya and Ratnasambhava are
supposed to have swayed  during thousands of years  the three worlds
which successively disappeared  as Amitabha  whose Bodhisatva is
Padmapani  sways since twenty four centuries the present world  in
closest spiritual union with the historical Buddha  to be succeeded
by Amoghasiddha  whose Bodhisatva is Vishvapani  the ultimate Buddha
the Buddha of universal love  Facing the four cardinal points and
the zenith  they sit with crossed legs  154  clothed in a thin robe
which leaves the right shoulder and arm bare  and have the distinctive
protuberance of the skull  generally also the  oorna   the symbol of
light  be it then produced by the sun or by lightning  A sixth Buddha
represented by the statues of the fifth and highest wall  is supposed
to refer to a power which dominates the other five  swaying in last
resort the destinies of all worlds without exception  but this theory
still needs confirmation  The statues of the circular terraces stood  or
rather sat  in bell shaped  chaityas   four to five feet high  capped
with tapering key stones which carry conical pinnacles  no  lingas
though this oft recurring motive of Hindu decoration may have suggested
the idea  These  chaityas   72 in number 155  and for the greater part
in ruin  shattered shells of sanctity  were closed all round and the
images inside  without aureoles  like the Buddhas lower down  only
visible through openings in the form of lozenges  Their peculiar contour
has led to the conjecture that they were constructed after the holy
padma  or lotus flower  a hypothesis to which their  padmasana  like
bases and the numerous peepholes  which might figurate empty seed lobes
lend some colour  Of the 72 Buddhas they protected  eighteen are wholly
lost and no more than ten escaped grievous hurt

Winding our way upward  passing through the galleries whose profound
silence  imbued with the intensely religious spirit radiating from their
sculptured walls  becomes more and more eloquent  circling the terraces
where the attitude of ecstatic elation of the world s pre eminently
venerable ones in their  chaityas  exalts the mind in tremulous
expectation  we arrive at the dagob  the shrine of shrines  the temple s
coronet  glittering in the bright glow of day  This is the reliquary
proper  the centre into which the holiness of the hallowed building
converges  It rises  similar to the smaller cupolas  but perpendicular
to a height of several feet  from a substructure in the guise of a
lotus cushion  it was also closed round about  without any aperture
so far as can be concluded from its present state  for a portion of
it has tumbled down and the base of the crowning pinnacle  reached by
ill matched  rickety steps  a recent  outrageously discordant addition
serves for a bench  the whole  about 25 feet above the topmost terrace
having been transformed into a crude belvedere  enabling visitors to
enjoy the magnificent view  The interior space seems originally to
have been divided into an upper and a lower chamber  there is nothing
deserving mention in the matter of decoration save an inscription to
remind posterity of the late King of Siam s visit in the disastrous year
1896  a delicious memorial  at the same time  of official vandalism and
servility  The golden letters affect one unpleasantly in the spoliated
sanctum  whose ruinous condition dates from a previous call  some
sixty or seventy years ago  permitted if not encouraged by previous
authorities  when looting pseudo archaeologists broke into it and
carried off the relic  which consisted  assuming the credibility of
local reports regarding their disappointment  in a small quantity of
ashy substance  enclosed in a metal urn with lid  furthermore in a
small image of metal and a few coins  The large statue they unearthed
too  would have impeded the movements of the marauders on their return
voyage and so it remained in place  half hidden in the hole they had
dug  undisturbed  for the same reason  by subsequent collectors  Left
unfinished by its sculptor  designedly or not  156  resembling in the
position of its hands the Dhyani Buddhas which face the East  does it
personify the Adi Buddha  a purely abstract entity  a metaphysical
conception hitherto defying even symbolic utterance  The learned and
especially the quasi learned never lacked weighty arguments pro or
contra  and  without prejudice to all they proved and disproved  157  it
does not appear improbable that the lively imagination of the Javanese
artist aimed at a tangible expression of him who ran his course as the
spirit and source of the Buddhist conception of happiness  resuscitated
from his ashes  dominating East and West  North and South  the blissful
abode of those progressing in self negation and the infernal regions
of prolonged earthly existence  by the strength of the divine rays
proceeding from the  oorna   illumining the path trodden by the virtuous
toward annihilation  terrifying the children of darkness  dwellers in
passion and sin  pervading all creation with his saintliness  the one of
the Paranirvana whose essence flowers in the beauty of the Boro Budoor
And the Moslim native worships him as the god of his ancestors  caught
in stone  smears him with  boreh  and performs acts of sacrifice before
him in spite of the Book fulminating against idolaters and of the almost
contemptuous familiarity intimated by the otherwise very appropriate
nickname bestowed on this heterodox deity  namely  recho belÃ¨q   which
means  statue in the mud

Illustration  XXXV  RELIEFS OF THE BORO BUDOOR

C  Nieuwenhuis

The work of restoration  started with excavations and the removal of
heaps of accumulated debris  has led to important discoveries  also in
relation to the dagob  Among shattered  naga  gargoyles  antefixes
carved detail of every description  fragments have been found of a
triple  payoong   an ornament in the form of a sunshade which capped
it  of a statuette supposed to have adorned its second storey  the
upper compartment of the cella  To quote from Major van Erp s last
published report  158  the excavations shed new light on the design
of some minor parts of the building  the decoration   e g    of the
lowest three staircases on each of the four sides  notwithstanding the
existing drawings  the  kala makara  motive seems to have entered into
the ornament of the entrance gate in the principal outer wall  the
design of the balustrade which enclosed the platform of the temple
and disappeared altogether  has been determined and a portion of it
will be rebuilt to show how things must have looked  slabs belonging to
the different series of bas reliefs  mostly of the  jataka  variety
have been unearthed or detected in neighbouring  kampongs   Especial
care is taken to retrieve those missing from the upper tier in the
first gallery  if the recovered reliefs are not always complete  the
recognisable principal figure explains generally the idea which the
sculptor intended to convey  with sufficient clearness to be grasped by
the trained archaeologist  And as to the rest of the detached pieces of
architectural value  dug up or otherwise revealed to the searching eye
the symmetric unity of the Boro Budoor is such that place and position
of each component part  however subordinate in the mighty fabric  are
easily ascertained  Every new find discloses new excellence  so far
undreamt of  in the constructive ability of the master builder whose
illuminated brain conceived the idea of this temple wherein he wrote the
history of a religion

    Whose goodly workmanship far past all other
   That ever were on earth  all were they set together

His name is unknown  though native fancy  descrying his likeness in the
profile of the Minoreh mountains  a fine conceit worthy of his genius
has baptised him Kiahi Guna Darma  Another tradition calls him Kiahi
Oondagi and makes him chisel the statue which  up to the time of the
late King of Siam s visit in 1896  stood near the  pasangrahan   facing
a damaged Amitabha and seemingly heartening the diminishing ranks of the
lions mounting guard  It had been brought thither from a place known
as Topog  about a mile distant  and was certainly a portrait statue
beautifully cut and with its extraordinarily clever features a rare
work of art  The story goes that  like Busketus  the architect  with
Rainaldus  of the Duomo at Pisa  his dearest wish was to have his
remains carried to rest under the stones of the edifice he had raised to
the honour of the unseen  that  baffled in his hopes and reincarnated
after his death because of some venial offence which made him fail in
attaining the Nirvana too  he fashioned this effigy to be set up at
the entrance of his  magnum opus   anticipating an idea of the equally
nameless artist who put the Byzantine stamp on San Marco in Venice  It
is an additional proof of the late King Chulalongkorn s discrimination
in favour of the very best that  making the permitted choice  his
Majesty included Kiahi Oondagi  but O  the official cringing and the
little piety shown to the memory of the illustrious labourer who wrought
this wonderful monument

On the hillock of Topog  the  deva agoong s  primitive home  two
wash basins in the form of  yonis   one of them of colossal dimensions
and resting on a crouched figure  testify to the worship of Siva s
sakti   the female principle of life personified in the Mahadeva s
Devi  Hindu motives in the ornament of the Boro Budoor avouch syncretism
having influenced the highest expression of Buddhism itself  there is
a four armed image with  padmasana  and  prabha   which  carrying a
Buddha in its  makuta   may hint at Vishnu s ninth  avatar   there is a
four armed figure seated on a throne supported by Siva s  vahana   the
bull  there is a goddess crowned with five  trishulas   etc  All this
illustrates again native tolerance in matters of religion as in other
respects  a result of the ancient habit of the Javanese in particular
to meet widely different races and civilisations half way  which has
preserved them from the narrow mindedness consequent on isolation  as
observed by a scholar who knows them well and whose study of special
subjects has in nowise impaired his breadth of vision  159  The
modification of this easy going temperament in contact with western
greed  offers abundant food for thought when we return to the cool
cave of refuge from passion where the  recho belÃ¨q  symbolises deep
contemplation and meditation terminating in absorption of self by
participation of the Spirit of the Universe  under the gaudy memorial
tablet   Koning van Siam  1896   which  in its glaring incongruity
symbolises the inverted process  160  The feeling of annoyance it
produces  soon passes when the mind begins to expand with admiration of
the scene of calm splendour beheld from the dagob containing the pollen
of the lotus of the law  The hues and harmonies of evening dispose to a
quietude nowhere else experienced or enjoyed in that measure  The only
sound heard is a faint humming of insects circling the pinnacles of the
chaityas  which divide the panorama of the plain below into views of
separate interest and beauty  bounded by the graceful outline of the
terraces and the distant hills  Ricefields and palmgroves stretch as
far as the eye can reach  with villages between  sheltered by their
orchards  earth s tapestry  embroidered in all gradations of green from
that of the sprouting  bibit padi  of the young plantations to that of
the thick foliage of centenarian  kanaris   The shadow of the temple
kissing the drowsy eyelids of the Kadu  lengthens towards the Merapi
over whose crater  gilt by the setting sun  hangs a cloud of dark smoke
which drifts slowly in the direction of the Merbabu  while the Soombing
to the northeast  looks tranquilly on  The darkness  ushered by the
smoke of the ill tempered old fire mountain  mingling with the pink and
purple of the western sky  spreads over the land  envelops forests and
gardens in gray  hushing all that breathes to sleep  One parting smile
of the sun s gladness and night descends in her sable robes  Nothing
stirs  the toils of day are forgotten in wholesome repose  it is the
hour of Amitabha  ruler of the region of sunset and spiritual father
of the present world s ruler  the one whose hands rest in his lap
after the completion of a laborious task  Morning will come and in time
the creation of a new world  the world of loving kindness  Vishvapani s
the Metteya Buddha s own  in time  long time  A  gardu  161  strikes
seven  another answers immediately with eight strokes on the
beloq   161  far away no more than six respond   what is time to the
native  Silence reigns again  silence emphasised by the high pitched
notes of a  suling   162  quavering indistinctly as the evening breeze
speeds the lover s complaint or refuses its aid  A noise of revelry in
the  pasangrahan  distracts the attention from this tuneful courtship
the visionary beings that were taking life from the germ of thought
hidden in its shrine  petrify into mute statues or vanish altogether
the spell of the Boro Budoor is broken

CHAPTER X

THE SOUL OF THE BORO BUDOOR

   CiÃ² ch io vedeva  mi sembrava un riso
         Dell universo      163

   DANTE ALIGHIERI S  Commedia    Paradiso   Canto 27


It has already been remarked that the natives knew of the existence of
the  chandi  Boro Budoor long before Cornelius  discoveries or  rather
that they never lost sight of it  and the place it occupies in the
Javanese chronicles appears from the  Babad Tanah Jawa   164  In the
early years of the eighteenth century Ki Mas Dana  son in law of Ki
Gedeh Pasukilan  incited the people of Mataram to a rebellion  which
broke out in the  dessa  Enta Enta  a centre of sedition it seems  since
only a short time before a certain Raden Suryakusumo  son of Pangeran
Puger  had chosen the same village for his headquarters when rising
against Mangku Rat II   who captured him and put him in an iron cage
without  however  killing him  because the omens were unfavourable  165
Ki Mas Dana had many followers and appointed  bupatis  and  mantris   Ki
Yagawinata   bupati  of Mataram  marched against him but was defeated
and fled to Kartasura  acquainting his Majesty with what had happened
Thereupon Pangeran Pringgalaya was sent to suppress Ki Mas Dana s
revolt  with instructions to capture him alive because his Majesty had
made a vow that he would exhibit him publicly as an example to the
inhabitants of Kartasura and let him be  rampokked  166  with needles
Pangeran Pringgalaya departed and with him half of the  bupatis  of
Kartasura  When he arrived at Enta Enta the battle began  Many rebels
were killed  Ki Mas Dana fled to the mountain Boro Budoor  He was
surrounded by the troops of Pangeran Pringgalaya and made a prisoner
Then they brought him to his Majesty at Kartasura  who ordered all
the inhabitants of the town to assemble in the  aloon aloon   each of
them with a needle  It lasted three days before all the inhabitants
of Kartasura had had their turn  When he was dead  his head was cut
off and exhibited on a pole  After the execution of Ki Mas Dana  the
news was received that his father in law Ki Gedeh Pasukilan had also
revolted  His Majesty ordered the repression of that revolt too  Ki
Gedeh Pasukilan was defeated and killed

Dr  Brandes  observing that the  chandi  Boro Budoor must have been
meant because there is no other place known of the same name and its
strategical value  given ancient modes of warfare  is obvious  puts
the date of its investment by Pangeran Pringgalaya to seize Ki Mas
Dana  at 1709 or 1710  A native reference to the Boro Budoor of half a
century later  is found in a Javanese manuscript  used by Professor C
Poensen for a paper on Mangku Bumi  first Sooltan of Jogjakarta  167
The conduct of the Pangeran Adipati  son of that Sooltan  grieved his
father very much  Besides his ignorance in literary matters  he was
proud and arrogant  he disdained his father s advice and associated with
the women of the toll gate  which caused all sorts of annoyance  He went
also to the Boro Budoor to see the thousand statues  notwithstanding
an old prediction that misfortune would befall the prince who beheld
those images  for one of them represented a  satrya   a noble knight
imprisoned in a cage  but it was the Prince s fate that he wished to see
the statue of the  satrya   Having gratified his desire  he remained in
the Kadu  where he led a most dissolute life  This gave great sorrow
to his father  the Sooltan  because the scandal reached such dimensions
that the  Dutch  Governor at Samarang heard of it and reprimanded him
Ashamed and angry  he sent a few  bupatis  with armed men to order the
Pangeran Adipati to return to Ngajogja  Jogjakarta   if he refused  they
had to use violence and were even authorised to kill him  The Pangeran
Adipati obeyed and was kindly received by his father  but soon after
he fell ill  spat blood and died  A letter of the Governor General
J  Mossel  dated December 30  1758  168  contains the passage   His
Highness  eldest son  the pangerang Adipatty Hamancoenagara  having
departed this life       and the profligate Crown Prince s visit to the
Boro Budoor may therefore be put at a few years less than fifty after Ki
Mas Dana s rebellion

It is clear  says Dr  Brandes  that at the time referred to in this
second record  the Boro Budoor was something more to the natives than
simply a hill  they knew of the building with the thousand statues  a
round number like that of the  chandi  Sewu  the  thousand temples   and
they knew of the images in the bell shaped  chaityas  on the circular
terraces  And though any one of those 72 statues or even the principal
statue in the central dagob may have been meant  in which last case
however  another expression than  kuroongan   cage  would appear more
appropriate  we think involuntarily of the Sang Bimo or Kaki Bimo
so called  a statue of the Buddha promoted or degraded by popular
superstition to the rank of a Pandawa  Arjuno s chivalrous brother
seated in the  chaitya  of the lowest circular terrace  next to and
south of the eastern staircase  still venerated by the natives  by the
Chinese community and by more women and men of European extraction than
are willing to confess it  Bimo or Wergodoro  to use the name given to
him in the  wayang lakons  when they extol his youthful exploits  is
the archetype of the  satrya   the pattern of ancestral knighthood
Most probably it was Sang Bimo who  conformably to the  ilaila  or
ancient prediction  executed the decree of fate on Pangeran Adipati
Hamangkunagara  Disregarding the example set by the invisible power
which resides in the Boro Budoor  a later Crown Prince of Jogjakarta
visited that temple in 1900 without  so far  coming to grief  Has then
the  ilaila  under special consideration lost its efficacy  We must
presume so  notwithstanding that the occult forces identified with Sang
Bimo and other statues of the ancient fane  are affirmed still to work
miracles in plenty when propitiated by adequate sacrifice

The greatest miracle of all is the elation of man s thought by the
irresistible charm which goes out from it  A night with the Boro Budoor
is a night of purification  when Amitabha offers the lotus of the good
law and the gift is accepted  when the wonderful edifice  rising to
the star spangled sky  unfolds terrace after terrace and gallery
after gallery between the domed and pinnacled walls  as his flower of
ecstatic meditation spreads its petals  opens its heart of beauty to the
fructifying touch of heaven  when tranquil love descends in waves of
contentment  unspeakable satisfaction  The dagob loses its sharp  bold
outline and melts into boundless space  a vision of fading existence in
consummation of wisdom  A mysterious voice  proceeding from the shrine
urges to search out the secret it hides  The summons cannot be resisted
and going up  trusting to the murky night  mounting the steps to the
first gate as in a somnambulistic trance  the seeker of enlightenment
discerns the path  guided by his quickened perception when the voice
dies of its own sweetness  the fragrant stillness appeasing the mind and
extending promise of pity for passion and fleshly desire  the garment
of sin left behind  Surely  it was the supreme wisdom  forgiving all
things because it understands  which inspired a human intellect to
devise  directed human hands to achieve in the delineation of mercy such
powerful architectural unity  sustained by such sublimely beauteous
ornament  Aided from above  the spirituality of the builder  creating
this masterpiece  needed not the laborious tricks passed off on us in
our days of feverish  effect hascherei  by artists who dispense with
the rudiments of their art to strive after the sensational  Neither
was his originality of the cheap kind which tries to cloak crass
technical ignorance and hopeless general ineptitude with paltry though
pretentious artifices  displaying a deplorable lack of the conceptive
faculty into the bargain  Proclaiming the doctrine glorious in veracity
of thought and utterance  the Boro Budoor typifies honest endeavour and
sincerity of purpose

Entering the first of the porches through which from four sides the
successive galleries and terraces are reached  we come under the
spell of the rapture symbolised by those vaulted staircases  leading
upward from reason to faith  constructed  it seems  to match the
evident portals  of the perfect state  composure  kindness  modesty
self knowledge  The Banaspati  terrifier of the evil spirits  shelters
him who proceeds on the path they indicate in clemency and charity  As
we pass on  confiding in his protection  the sculptured walls gleam
softly  impregnated by the sun s light embedded in the stones  and
the germ of truth  treasured in the dagob  radiates down in luminous
substantiation of the word  making the invisible visible by degrees  The
air hangs heavy and warm in the galleries and throbs with the emotion
excited by the lustrous reliefs which picture the life of the Buddha
A flush of indescribable splendour  clear exhalation of his virtue and
holiness  lifts veil after veil from the bliss this initiation portends
The transparent atmosphere lends new significance to the gestures of the
Dhyani Buddhas  seated on their lotus cushions as stars half quenched
in golden mist  while we feel more than see the serene calmness of
their features still wrapped in obscurity  Their contemplation is the
beginning of the highest  their ecstasy pierces eternity  opens the
regions of infinite intelligence  complete self effacement  absolute
nothingness  Too much absorbed in abstract cogitation to occupy
themselves with matters of mundane interest  they leave the government
of the created worlds to their spiritual sons  and Padmapani is the
Mahasatva on whom our age depends  Out topping human knowledge  they
teach the meaning of the universe  the Buddha of the East dreaming his
dreams as the sun rises  the Buddha of the South blessing the day  the
Buddha of the West unfolding the secret of the all spirit as the sun
sets  the Buddha of the North pointing the way from darkness to light
the Buddha of the Zenith lifting his hands to turn the wheel of the law
The statues smile beatitude in happiness at losing the consciousness
of existence when they will be worthy of the Nirvana  the solution of
life in non being  death which disclaims resurrection in any form  And
the highest attainable blessing  the Paranirvana  the Nirvana Absolute
is signified in the image of the central dagob  however interpreted as
solitary indweller of the shrine of shrines built over the remains of
the flesh which embodied the word  the Tathagata  the self subsisting
preceded and to be succeeded in fullness of time  it figures the
immanence in bodily imperfection of the energy for good which sanctified
Ayushmat Gautama  who modified his carnality by dominating his senses
who  when questioned by his first disciples  could declare that he was
the expected teacher of lucid perception and replete comprehension
the discerning monitor  the destroyer of error  the spotless counsellor
impelled to release them from the bonds of sin and make them deserve the
manifest favour of annihilation

The rudely interrupted sleep of the  recho bÃ¨lÃ¨t  formulated
intentionally or not  a confession of faith in the reward of
righteousness by complete dissolution  cessation of continuance  eternal
rest undisturbed by gods or men  by feeling or thought  The pilgrim
to the Boro Budoor  longing for the  arahat ship  accomplished in the
science of conducting himself  must have hesitated before ascending to
the highest terrace and seeking direct communion with the pure spirit
of the son of virtue  born of a woman truly  but whose mother died
seven days after his birth  in token of his eminence  the venerable one
whose moral strength stands paramount  overcometh even the innate fear
of extinction  The essence of the Triratna lies here within the grasp
of the earnest inquirer  the precious pearl whose lustre divulges the
principle of causation  the beginning and the end of all things  the
primary source of what is and shall be  How to obtain it  By offerings
to the symbolic stone  Not so  but by good works and self examination
which excels prayer and makes any place a Bodhimanda  a seat of
intelligence  The Buddha was a man  no god surpassing the limits of
humanity  who has to be propitiated by adoration  Whoso wishes the
Rescuer s saving grace  should remember the story of Upagoopta and the
courtesan Vasavadatta  and ask  Has my hour arrived  169  Penance for
errors committed  not by fasting and self torture  but by persevering
in the eight fold path of right views  right aspirations  right speech
right behaviour  right search of sustenance  right effort  right
mindfulness of our fellow creatures  right exultation  should ward off
the dire punishment of remorse which in well balanced spirits cannot
dwell  Self restraint  uprightness  control of the organs of sense
makes the fell fire of the three deadly sins  sensuality  ill will and
moral sluggishness  die out in the heart by a proper arrangement of
the precious vestments  the six cardinal virtues  charity  cleanness
patience  courage  contemplative sympathy with all creation and
discrimination of good and evil  This leads to perfection  advancement
to the highest of the four sublime conditions  the Brahma Viharas on
which Buddhism improved by making equanimity with regard to one s own
joys and sorrows the test of progress on the road which leads to bliss
in extermination of pain  Loosen the shackles of worldly existence by
constant application to escape from the fatal thraldom imposed by birth
and rebirth  Life is continued misery  no salvation from the distress
caused by passion and sin is possible except by cessation of self  by
merging individual in universal vacancy  mounting the four steps of the
Dhyana in contemplative evolution of the Nirvana  refining perception
and speculation to total impassibility  extinguishing reason itself in
eternal voidness  where we have nothing to fear and nothing to hope
for  taking refuge in non existence  the only conceivable verity

Heart and head rebel against such a religion  which considers conscious
life the great enemy to be destroyed  seeks life s meed in dissolution
of energy  man s best part flickering out as the flame of a spent
candle  With the gladdening odour of the garden of Java in our nostrils
rational instinct struggles free from the torment of imposed passivity
and we rather take a more militant stand concordant with the Buddha s
dying words  Work out your salvation with diligence  How is it to be
done  Shall we turn for guidance to the creed of the men of power and
pelf  who seem to think that their best recommendation to divine favour
is the defacement  in their western theological mill  of the gospel they
received from the East  whose mouths are filled with promises while
their hands sow calamity  whose moral superiority is but a delusion
who mar impiously what they pretend to improve  who boast of investing
their moral surplus in political efficiency  as King Siladitiya did  for
the benefit of their wards  but whose greedy immorality spoils even the
reckoning of their own selfishness  Not so  their deeds giving the lie
to their words  their iniquities increasing  their trespasses growing
up into the heavens  who can wonder that the glory of the deity they
profess to worship  suffers in the estimation of the native  And yet
how might Christianity thrive in a soil prepared by the doctrine of
elimination of self  by adherence to the three duties Buddhism laid down
as far more important than Brahmanic sacrifice  continence  kindness
reverence for the life of all creatures  Insisting on man s obligations
to his fellow men  the Buddha anticipated by six centuries the precept
Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself  If he did not match it with
the first and greater commandment of the Christian dispensation  his
atheism  to quote Hunter  was a philosophical tenet which  so far from
weakening the sanctions of right and wrong  gave them new strength from
the doctrine of Karma or the metempsychosis of character  Teaching that
sin  sorrow and deliverance  the state of a man in this life  in all
previous and all future lives  is the inevitable result of his own acts
the Buddha applied the inexorable law of cause and effect to the soul
What we sow  we must reap   All spirits are enslaved which serve things
evil   as redemption flowers from straight vision  straight thought
straight exertion in truthful endeavour  The lesson might be profitably
taken to heart in furtherance of a nation s Karma by statesmen who have
no explanation for the unsatisfactory condition of dependencies oversea
but evasive oratory backed by a dexterous shuffling of cooked colonial
reports and doctored colonial statistics when the sinister farce of
the colonial budget is on the boards  And each of us  however limited
his sphere  finds his own opportunities for individual transition to a
higher state  like Gautama we meet every day the poor and needy  the old
and decrepit in want of assistance  the prostrate sufferer in agony of
death

And  like Gautama  each one who strives for enfranchisement  must have
his struggle with Mara  the Prince of Darkness  After the first watch
on the Boro Budoor  night thickens and covers the earth as a pall  the
wan stars glimmer weakly  shining on the misery of deficient fulfilment
of intention  Reflecting on our errors of commission and omission
seeing our deeds laid bare and their why and wherefore  dejection
masters hope  though steadfast determination might take an example at
the Buddha wrestling with the Enemy  who offered him the kingdom of
the four worlds  though we know that the giving or withholding of the
fifth  the world of glory  is beyond the Enemy s power  We see the
contest re enacted before us and tremble  Appearing bodily  horrible to
behold  Mara  the god of carnal love  passion and sin  Papiyan  the very
vicious  besets the incarnate word  surrounded by his demons of ever
changing gruesome aspect  barking dogs with enormous fangs and lolling
tongues  roaring tigers with sharp  murderous claws and bloodshot eyes
hissing serpents  darting forward to strike and crush their prey  While
we fancy the contest raging hottest round valiant patience  personified
in the image of the dagob  the maimed statues of the  chaityas  and
lower niches join in the dire battle as the headless spirits that rode
upon the tempest when Evil assailed the elect s purity  Papiyan cannot
prevail and seeing the futility of violence  he has recourse to his
daughters  the winsome  apsaras   who dance and provoke to lascivious
commerce by their seductive arts  But they make no more impression than
their brutish brothers and  in spite of themselves  they are compelled
to praise the fortitude of a virtue which will not succumb even when
one of them assumes the shape of a beloved youthful spouse  The baffled
apsaras  dissolve in floating vapour  and Papiyan  in despair  traces
flaming characters on the dome of the dagob with his last arrow  My
empire is ended  The stars resume their brightness and a sense of coming
light pervades the gloom of despondency  It is borne toward us in the
flower tendered by Chandra  the deity of the chaste radiance proceeding
from the conqueror s crest  Lo  his crown is transferred to the sky and
climbing slowly  the cusped moon invests the moulders of past and future
worlds with halos of liquid silver

This is the time  the stilly hour before dawn  the last watch before
morning  the chosen moment of the Buddha s attainment to the summit
of the triple science  wherein the supernatural beauty of the Boro
Budoor  cleansed and reconsecrated after the white man s profanation
by the burning fire of day and the mellow touch of night  helps us to
penetrate the meaning of his promise  He who holds fast to the law and
discipline and faints not  he shall cross the ocean of life and make an
end of sorrow  The blitheness of spirit which consists  because of that
whereby the sun riseth and setteth  and the moon waxeth and waneth  in
discarding the ignorance engendered by conceding to this world a reality
it does not possess  regarding as constant that which changes with
every wind that blows   the exaltation born from silent contemplation
loses its vagueness in the manifestation of the godhead in ourselves
For contemplation becomes seeded and blooms in the triad of meditation
the recognition of the entities of time and space  and connecting
thought as the unity of universal relationship  The Dhyani Buddhas
wrapped in the shadows from which dawn will deliver them  seek to
comprehend  and our mentality expanding with theirs  looking down upon
the gray waves of mist that break on the old temple as on a rock of ages
in a stormy sea  we feel the dagob rise to meet the moonbeams and soar
to unutterable delight  Presently the first smile of day salutes and
awakens mother earth  a murmur of contentment thrills the air in harmony
of praise  the dimming  quivering stars  the crimson mountain tops
the purple and azure perspective between  all creation combines in a
song of thanksgiving  The mystic planetary music  the singing together
of earth and heaven in melody of colour and sound  welcomes the bright
morning  Dawn  with blushing face and heart of gold  bewrays the glory
of her eternal abode to the world of man  sending her outriders before
the Asvins  the lords of lustre  whose shining armour  forged of the
sun s rays  illumines the pearly sky with dazzling splendour  They roll
the billowy vapours together and chase them up the hill side  like wool
of divers changing colours carded   that the eye of the life giver may
rest on the plain where the palm groves rise in the hazy dew as emerald
islands in an opalescent lake  The Merbabu and the Soombing are still
half in darkness when the Merapi  flecked with orange and violet  blazes
in reflection of aÃ«rial effulgence  soon to commingle the smoke of its
fiery crater with the clouds mounting its slopes  The fire mountains
keep a good watch on the garden of Java  than which Jatawana  the famous
pleasance where the Buddha enounced the substance of his teachings
preserved in the Sutras  cannot have been more delicious  and the Merapi
in particular makes the land pass under the rod when sacred covenants
are broken

169  The story points a moral not less relevant to western than to
eastern ethics and runs as follows

Once upon a time there lived in Mathura a courtesan renowned for
her beauty and her name was Vasavadatta  On a certain day her maid
having been sent to buy perfume at a merchant s  who had a son called
Upagoopta  and having stayed out rather long  she said

 It appears  my dear  that this youth Upagoopta pleases you exceedingly
well  since you never buy in any shop but his father s

 Daughter of my master  answered the maid  besides being comely  clever
and polite  Upagoopta  the son of the merchant  passes his life in
observing the law

These words awakened in Vasavadatta s heart a desire to meet Upagoopta
and she bade her maid go back and make an appointment with him  But the
youth vouchsafed no other reply than   My sister  the hour has not yet
arrived

Vasavadatta thought that Upagoopta refused because he could not afford
to pay the high price she demanded for her favours  and she bade her
maid tell him that she did not intend to charge him a single cowry if
only he would come  But Upagoopta replied in the same words   My sister
the hour has not yet arrived

Shortly after  the courtesan Vasavadatta  annoyed by the jealousy of
one of her lovers  who objected to her selling herself to a wealthy old
voluptuary  ordered her servants to kill the troublesome fellow  They
did so without taking sufficient precautions against discovery  the
crime became known and the King of Mathura commanded the executioner to
cut off her hands  feet and nose  and abandon her thus mutilated among
the graves of the dead

Upagoopta hearing of it  said to himself  When she was arrayed in fine
clothes and no jewels were rare and costly enough to adorn her body
it was a counsel of wisdom for those who aspire to liberation from the
bondage of sin to avoid her  with her beauty  however  she has certainly
lost her pride and lustfulness  and this is the hour

Accordingly  Upagoopta went up to the cemetery where the executioner
had left Vasavadatta maimed and disfigured  The maid  having remained
faithful  saw him approach and informed her mistress who  in a last
effort at coquetterie  told her to cover the hideous wounds with a piece
of cloth  Then  bowing her head before her visitor  Vasavadatta spoke

 My master  when my body was sweet as a flower  clothed in rich
garments and decked with pearls and rubies  when I was goodly to behold
you made me unhappy by refusing to meet me  Why do you come now to look
at one from whom all charm and pleasure has fled  a frightful wreck
soiled with blood and filth

 My sister  answered Upagoopta  the attraction of your charms and the
love of the pleasures they held out  could not move me  but the delights
of this world having revealed their hollowness  here I am to bring the
consolation of the lotus of the law

So the son of the merchant comforted the courtesan doing penance for her
transgressions  and she died in a confession of faith to the word of the
Buddha  hopeful of rebirth on a plane of chastened existence

BIBLIOGRAPHY


It has been suggested that the practical value of this volume might be
enhanced by the addition of a short bibliography indicating the works
to which students  who wish to go deeper into the subjects touched
upon  could turn for more ample information   Il y a l embarras du
choix  and  always abreast with latest research  particularly the
publications of learned societies as the Royal Institute of the Dutch
East Indies  the Royal Geographical Society of the Netherlands  the
Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences  are rich depositories of Dutch
East Indian lore  many of the most important monographs they contain
being available in book or pamphlet form  Not to speak of the specific
knowledge derivable from such sources as the official Reports of the
Archaeological Commission for Java and Madura  the Bulletins of the
Colonial Museum at Haarlem  etc   from periodicals as  Het Tijdschrift
voor Binnenlandsch Bestuur   organ of the Dutch East Indian Civil
Service    Het Indisch Militair Tijdschrift   etc   less scientifically
or professionally dressed but just as weighty observations on different
aspects of Dutch rule in the Malay Archipelago can be found in monthlies
like  De Gids    De Tijdspiegel  and  of course   De Indische Gids  in
which  Het Tijdschrift voor Nederlandsch IndiÃ«   founded by W  R  Baron
van HoÃ«vell  has been incorporated  The  Encyclopaedie van Nederlandsch
IndiÃ«  is a very serviceable storehouse of general intelligence  though
new discoveries made and old theories exploded since its appearance
emphasise more forcibly with every year  the necessity of its usefulness
being sustained if not by occasional new editions  revised and brought
up to date  then at least by frequent supplements  The  Daghregisters
of the Castle of Batavia  the  Nederlandsch Indisch Plakaatboek
1602 1811   the  Realia   a register of the General Resolutions from
1632 to 1805  offer almost inexhaustible material for the history of
Java and the other islands in the days of the Dutch East India Company
J  C  Hooykaas   Repertorium   1595 1816   continued by A  Hartmann
up to 1893  and by W  J  P  J  Schalker and W  C  Muller up to 1910
furnishes an excellent index to Dutch colonial literature  C  M  Kan s
Proeve eener Geographische Bibliographie van Nederlandsch Oost IndiÃ«
1865 1880  and Martinus Nijhoff s  Bibliotheca Neerlando Indica
1893  should also be mentioned  The following miscellaneous list is an
attempt briefly to enumerate the works  apart from papers accessible
only in serial publications  which seem specially adapted  allowing
a good deal in not a few of them for mutual admiration and all too
courteous  excessive panegyric  to give interested readers further
particulars  according to each one s individual line of investigation

Section 4   Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment   Many small donations
 1 to  5 000  are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States   Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort  much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements   We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance   To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http   pglaf org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements  we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted  but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States   U S  laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses   Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks  online payments and credit card donations
To donate  please visit  http   pglaf org donate


Section 5   General Information About Project Gutenberg tm electronic
works

Professor Michael S  Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone   For thirty years  he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support


Project Gutenberg tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions  all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U S
unless a copyright notice is included   Thus  we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility

    http   www gutenberg org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg tm
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation  how to help produce our new eBooks  and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks
